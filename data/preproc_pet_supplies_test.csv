1,excellent heater two heat two hundred gallon tank constant eighty-two degree problem like temp controller away actual heater make much easy fine tune temp without get wet remove first highly recommended buy need use two month probs far,Excellent heater. Two of these have heated a 200 gallon tank to a constant 82 degrees with no problem.  I like having the temp controller away from the actual heater. It makes it so much easier for fine tuning the temps without getting wet or having to remove them first.  Highly recommended and will buy again when needed.  Been using for two months and no probs so far.
0,waste money piece junk con one jam way easily two litter tray way shallow three need guard pee nt seep cat pee four need guard back litter nt leak back box five motor need power first automatic littermaid litter box lm900 work great last three year quiet hardly ever seem problem lm nine hundred broke littermaid nt make anymore stupidly buy lm9000mb nothing problem need put guard back box one cat like dig seem manage push litter back box cat pee lot apparently clump large rake push plus pee seeps rake back box take box apart every couple day wash box rake huge hassle cover attachment big issue machine jam easily jam mid way cycle either stop middle box upright position leave receptical open think idea automatic litter box would nt scoop deal box except month clean box rake basically go throw current automatic litter box basically scoop box twenty-three time day darn thing jam easily,"Do not waste you money on this piece of junk!

Cons:
1) Jams way too easily
2) Litter tray is way too shallow
3) Need a guard so that pee doesn't seep through as the cat pees
4) Need a guard in the back so that the litter doesn't leak out of the back of the box
5) Motor needs more power

The very first automatic Littermaid litter box that was a LM900 worked great and lasted about three years, was quiet and hardly ever seemed to have any problems.  After the LM 900 broke and Littermaid wasn't making it anymore, I stupidly bought the LM9000MB and have had nothing but problems with them.  They need to put a guard up in the back of the box because one of my cats likes to dig and he seems to manage to push the litter out of the back of the box.  The other cat pees a lot and apparently the clumps are too large for the rake to push them plus the pee seeps through the rake into the back of the box and I have to take the box apart every couple of days to wash the box and rake which is a huge hassle with the cover attachment.  The biggest issue is the machine jams so easily and it will jam mid way through it's cycle with either stopping in the middle of the box or in the upright position leaving the receptical open.  I thought the idea of an automatic litter box was I wouldn't have to scoop or deal with the box except once a month to clean the box and rake.  I am basically going to have to throw out this current automatic litter box because I basically am scooping the box 2-3 times a day now because the darn thing jams so easily!!"

The problem is that the faux sheepskin cover just covers the side and top portions of the foam core.  The bottom is completely exposed and therefore turns into a chew toy for my two border collie puppies.  Also, because the foam bottom is bare to the ground, it will absorb water like a sponge.  I haven't had a problem with another dog bed that I bought that is completely covered.  The puppies can't get into it and its made of a higher quality material.  My recommendation is to buy a completely covered bed with a zipper that you can unzip and wash."

0,unfortunately filter one fit pump cheaply make white foam part unevenly cut side lot dirt poop escape back tank also size varies filter filter package one might fit fine others fall need constant adjusting filter fit pump love little pump guess gon na buy,Unfortunately these filters are the only ones to fit this pump and they are cheaply made the white foam part is unevenly cut in all the sides so a lot of dirt poop escapes back into your tank. Also the size varies from filter to filter in the same package so one might fit just fine while others fall off and need constant adjusting. But it is the only filter to fit this pump and I love this little pump so I guess I'm gonna be buying this them again

The only problem are the cuffs which are too small! My poor cat couldn't move and felt like in a straight jacket! Luckily I'm able to sew an I removed the cuffs at the legs.

So I just made 2 cuts in the neckband and now it fits perfect! My little darling is now able to walk, eat and play but unable to clean her wound!

It really gets rid of cat urine. My cats developed a bad habit of pooping on the bathroom floor because I've been trying to toilet train them and they will not poop over their own pee.

They play, sleep and peer out the window on this tower and happily wile away hours that might be spent pestering me instead.
The tower is very easy to assemble and is pretty easy on the eyes considering it's cat furniture. So it does rock a little bit. I could remedy this if i didn't have an apartment with radiant heat coming from floor radiators thus making it impossible to get the tower to sit flush against a wall.
All in all, it was a great purchase. They even play with the ball on a string ( I tied it back on after they pulled it off the first time and it's remained since)."

I installed it into a new door on saw horses before I hung it. I would say it's definitely a two man job, at least doing it that way. The pet door frame is just slightly racked on one corner where the bolt wouldn't pull tight, but no weather gets through. My friend said one of the bolts looked bent to him when we were tightening it. I think he drilled the hole crooked. No matter. The cats love it. I left the flaps off for one day when the weather was still good, then added one flap. By the time the weather gets nasty, I'll add the second flap. The directions say to install it two inches above the height of the animal. I installed mine just a little low. The flaps push hard at the top, and the cats weren't too sure about it at first, but now they've learned to push through at the bottom of the flap. Recommendations: Be sure to cut the hole straight, drill the holes straight, and follow the instructions as to the installation height. Have someone help you if you're not handy with tools. You only get one chance when you install it."

This worked great for her. Much better than the plastic cone from the vet and much more comfortable. I used a shoelace to tie and hold this onto her. It made taking this off and on very easy especially with the velcro strips. I went with just the large size. I had to use the last velcro strip but I think that was better than buying the next size up and dealing g with extra material.

I've bought this plant several times over the past year and the last two times I have ordered it I have been disappointed, with the most recent order being the most disappointing of all. For starters, the plant doesn't look as realistic as it used to. Side by side with the ones I ordered a year ago the color is almost a bright neon green vs. the more realistic dark green it used to be. Each leaf is thinner/lower quality as well, almost transparent. Also, this recent batch of plants I ordered had all been sealed improperly and had wire exposed (which can rust and be toxic to fish). Two of the plants I ordered also arrived broken. The seller offered me a 70% refund, but overall I would not recommend buying this plant anymore. It really isn't what it used to be (I gave it a 5 star rating before)."

Product description says max 132lbs.  Sticker on Flexi Vario says 55lb max.  What gives?
Last weigh in my dog was 55lbs, thinking she's packed on some more pounds since.  Gave it a test drive in the back yard.  A SMALL dog could jump through the 'Safety collar'.  That's the bad stuff.

Good stuff:  It feels well made.  The tape moved easily.  There's a dial on the inside of the handle, and while there's NO info on what that is on the instructions, we figured it out.  I thought it might be a tension adjustment, but no, it raises or lowers a plastic piece of the bottom of the handle so your pinky/bottom of your hand has a rest.  If you have giant hands or are wearing gloves you'd probably still be ok using this.  When not wearing gloves you could raise the 'rest'.  I found this comfortable and due to the ever growing dog my hands are taking a beating so this was welcome.

The test run didn't last long, but as far as introducing the dog to something new it went well.  I was able to get it on her.  However she didn't use it in a traditional manner.  She held the tape in her mouth and walked about.  When it was clear a test walk was not going to happen, I ended the test.

I am not sure that I will use this outside of fenced property 1. depends on dog walking with it the right way and 2. concerned about the weight capacity."

I pictured our lab grabbing it in the middle and shaking it.  She loves to do that, but the elastic broke right away,  and tugging it caused the main seam to break, so it is useless.  I hate that they said it was a Tug Toy.  It is NOT a tug toy.  If they use it as a tug toy, it is not usable after that.  I don't think much thought was put into making this toy so it didn't fall apart.

I am returning it.  I refuse to support manufacturers who make ""cheap"", fall-apart toys.  I think they falsely advertised it ""Tug Toy""  just to appeal to dog owners who love their dogs."

I figured with a puppy, it would be great to have two so that if she made a mess in one, I would have another to use while washing the first. The only advantage/Pro I have about these beds, are they are soft and cushy. My puppy (and the rest of our dogs) loved to lay in them.... and then the faux fur started coming out by the tuft-fulls. Being a puppy, she would dig in the bed and come up with mounds of fluffy fiber ""fur"" from the bed. I tried washing them both, several times, only to find my washer and dryer both, clogged with the fur. They do hold their cushiness after repeated washings, but even after repeated washings, I still have a ton of those fibers to clean out of the machines. It just never seems to stop and I don't think it will until the beds are bald. Its a shame as I really wanted to like these beds and they are soft and the dogs like them, but its not worth it to me when the puppy could eat that fur and potentially get into real trouble.

I would recommend though if you are buying this product two by two of them because when you take one out to clean it it needs to dry before it goes back in and all I needed was hot water and it cleaned very very well the first time. I've had this in my tank for a month now and just cleaned it in the picture below is how it looks now after I cleaned it I really didn't put much effort into it other than boiling hot water under the sink and rocks outside so it doesn't blow away and so the carpet stays flat I would also recommend getting a soft bristle to scrape unmentionables away so you're not wasting water no chemical is really needed to clean this and I spent $8 on this it was well worth it I just wish I had another one. The only issue I really have with this is that when it dries it does shrivel, thus the reason the rocks are on it while it dries"

Yes, that means all-natural and would seem to mimic what cats eat ""in the wild.""

Cats' nutritional needs DO vary though depending on life-stage and the condition of their health, and for that reason, I think this product should be marketed as a specialty food.

Your vet SHOULD be aware of the very real benefits of this kind of product (i.e. it is pure and the ingredients are ""human-grade"").

My cat's cardiologist recommended it.

But there ARE important factors to be considered.

Proceed with caution.

A high-protein diet is contra-indicated for renal problems, for instance.

Even if your cat is healthy now, if the breed is prone to certain diseases, etc., you'll want to do some research before feeding him or her TikiCat.

That being said, my cat did love it, and once he tasted it, it was all he wanted to eat."

Only used half the box and it is going in the trash -- particularly after reading C. Harper's review as of May 21, 2014.  Our cat has been lethargic and engaging in some strange behaviors.

When I say freak out, I mean his eyes dialate, he climbs up our legs and bites us or he'll attack one of the other pets.

I put on the Thunder Shirt and within 15 minutes my daughter started wailing (which is another trigger for my cat to go crazy), and with that shirt on, he didn't attack anyone... He just looked at us like ""I feel like I should be doing something"".  He was still noticeably upset but he didn't act on it.

It was the first time EVER that he didn't loose his mind and get in a fight with one of the dogs or other cats.  It's definitely worth trying.  He's about 9lbs, a petite frame with medium hair and the small didn't fit but the medium was perfect.  it's not something he can wear 100% of the time because he can't jump in it but when he is inside the house, he'll be wearing it."

I felt so bad while opening the gift with her, made me feel like you can't buy anything cheaper than that!! And present it to the woman you love!!

This system looks like it was built in the garage and even garage built aquaponics systems are so much better than that!! I honestly don't know why and how they got all that funding in kickstarter!!

Our 13 lb. Havanese kind of runs hot and cold with it.  It's easy to load, but you may have to cut your dog treats to size, depending on how big they are.  My only issue is that our dog is already tearing it apart.  He chewed a big chunk out of one side within a week.  I may end up getting one of the ""snowman"" Kong toys, because they seem more durable.

So, this is pretty good - our dog sometimes loses interest pretty quickly, but overall it does what it's supposed to."

Although the DoggyRide Novel is a bit more expensive than other brands, it's definitely worth it.  The trailer is made of high quality materials and is very well thought out.  It's easy for one person to put it together.  My dog is a bit less than 50 pounds and she fits in it nicely.  I haven't found anything yet that I would change.

There's plenty of breeze that goes through the mesh windows but because there's still a cover over the trailer I suspect it gets a bit warm inside.  Dog owners should be sure to park the trailer in the shade when not moving and to bring along water for their dogs."

It could have been very ugly if it had broken after my beloved cat jumped onto it. Kitty could have been hurt, something might have gotten broke, including the window. There are two wires with a 'button' on the end of each, to be threaded through 2 holes to hold the bed part in place. I had such high hopes for this. I sure hope that I just had bad luck and received the rare product that slipped through quality control undetected, because the thought that this company would allow their product to endanger people's pets and home decorations and windows is hard to accept.

Update: August, 2016.

The lady that owns and operates this business contacted me immediately after posting my review. She was genuinely concerned, stating that they are a small company that makes all of their products themselves, and that they take customer satisfaction seriously. She sent me another, free of charge. Sadly, it broke during the first use, in the exact same place. I called her back. She said that she has never had that happen twice to the same customer. She sent me a third. It seemed better, but here it is two months later and this one also broke in the exact same way. I love to support small businesses, local, made in America, etc. But, I love my cats, and I cannot promote this product. I find it hard to believe that this was just bad luck. I truly hope that they find a solution to this breakage problem. I want them to succeed. I'd even be willing to give them another chance in the future, if the reviews show that improvements had been made."

I purchased these because they were on a lightning deal and our dogs REALLY needed new collars. Theirs were getting pretty mucky. I purchased the pink ones, one large and one medium.

It took a lot of figuring out how to put them on, exactly, because the collar wraps inside itself (through the silver ring). Once we got them adjusted, they looked very smart. We use harnesses to walk our girls (on a dual lead, since they are sled dog breeds and pull quite a bit), so I can't attest to the durability of these collars. I just know they look great. We did NOT put their dog tags on the little plastic clip that is built in. It didn't look sturdy enough to hold for two girls who grab each other by the collar and rip the heck out of each other wrestling. We've lost tags before and can't chance it, as Huskies are runners and our local shelter hasn't quite mastered using the chip scanner yet."

I've been trying for the past eight months or so to find one that (a) would keep the water warm enough for the fish but (b) wouldn't boil the fish alive.

In my quest, I've tried two Marineland heaters. Neither one worked the way it was supposed to, and yes -- I DID follow the instructions, to the letter. These are the ones I tried:

1. The Marineland Shatterproof 10-Watt Mini Heater (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176DUEY/ref=oss_product) for tanks up to 3 gallons. This one barely kept the water at 74 degrees (even though it's supposedly factory preset for 78) and it only worked for a couple weeks. It quit, and I was back to wrapping a human's heating pad around the tank while I searched for a replacement.

2. The Shatterproof Mini Heater 10watt (http://www.amazon.com/MarineLand-SHATTERPROOF-MINI-HEATER-10WATT/dp/B0037PJMMC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1286290350&sr=8-4), also for tanks up to 3 gallons. This one heated the water into the high 80s, even though it, too, was supposedly factory preset for 78. I don't know how much higher it would have gone, and I didn't dare leave it on overnight for fear I'd be facing a boiled fish in the morning. I yanked it out of the tank and went back to the heating pad.

Finally, I found the Elite Submersible Preset Mini Heater 25W - Elite A748. It's compact, it's unobtrusive, and it actually works as advertised. After a little fiddling with the adjustable control, my betta is now comfy and cozy at about 76 degrees. I don't have to worry about it boiling him overnight, and the tank stays warm even now that the nights are starting to get chilly and our house hovers at 69 degrees. I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far I'm very happy with it.

I'll try to remember to update this review after a few months, but for right now, my recommendation is to avoid Marineland products -- or at least, the ones with ""factory presets."" Maybe their adjustable ones are better, but my Marineland experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.

UPDATE: It is now Feb. 9, 2011, and the heater is still going strong, despite several power blinks and outages during a recent Midwest blizzard. My fish is happy. I am happy. Life is good.

UPDATE #2: It is now June 18, 2012. I just realized I hadn't given an update on this item and figured it would be worthwhile. Sadly, ""Sushi"" has left us due to natural causes, but this little gem worked like a champ right up until we didn't need it anymore, sometime during the 2011 holidays. Now it's in storage, waiting for another fish to warm, should we choose to get one."

My dog is just a the 20 lb. mark, which i believe is the limit for this crate. The dimensions seemed to match the old one (which we're back to using). Maybe I didn't put it together correctly - but, it sure looked fine and it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to do this. Anyway, put my dachshund Mick in the kennel and left him at home while I ran errands. Got home and he had not just opened the door, he knocked it right off its hinges, flat on the floor! He was running around merrily, apparently quite proud of himself for breaking out of prison. We are back to the very slightly larger, chewed up and dilapidated old kennel. It looks awful - but it works. I'm actually adopting another, smaller dog and hope this kennel will work for him. If he also manages to escape, I may contact the manufacturer."

Normally the pumps would last for about three years before I have to replace them, more often because of the impeller worn out. Recently I bought five of these pumps without reading the reviews given here (quite unfortunately). I installed the first pump and after two days it stopped working. I was amazed as I never had this before and opened the pump just to find out the impeller paddles were broken. They were the purple impeller replacing the old white one mentioned in the reviews here. Then I went on to the second pump, which it won't work out of the box, this time was apparently a bad engine. The third pump worked for two days and then stopped working, the engine again. The fourth pump won't work out of the box. The fifth pump worked for a week and the purple impeller paddles broke. All the pumps have a silver ""passed"" seal (quality control) on them. I am amazed that a company in which you trust (and that most likely knows about the problem) can do this to their customers. For me is almost two hundred dollars lost. I will never buy a Marineland product in my life again. My advice is, think about it before you do..."

I bought not having very high expectations but I am pleasantly surprised. My dog figured out she can get two barks in before it does anything besides beeping but it had been a lifesaver for the days she wants to lay outside and I don't want to disrupt the neighborhood. She is an 8lb Maltese mix and the vibration is just enough to irritate her into stopping. We have been using it for 3 or 4 weeks and I'm hoping it continues the way it is. It's an awesome value for the money as some other ""little dog"" collars can run upwards of $90. I am very happy."

We now don't use it at all because it worked so poorly. First thing is the quality. It all just seems really cheap and poorly made. Then it only works if the dog is facing in the same direction as the remote and the remote is pointed directly at the sensor on the collar. This doesn't work when a dog is running around barking (which is exactly when you need it to work). I thought about giving it to a friend, but I wouldn't even want to do that. I will likely just donate it to the Goodwill. Great price, but you are getting exactly what you're paying for so don't expect much beyond that."

The only good thing about this product is the little pink carrier and even that has hardly any windows. The poor pet would feel like it is in prison, not out for a nice stroll.  The stroller itself is junk, flimsy and the wheels don't even all touch the ground.  It may last a month, not confident in that even.  The would only take it back if I paid $20 shipping.  Really not worth the price or hassle. So I'm stuck with it."

In any case, I had some carpet to clean with an enzymatic cleaner, and while I knew the general area, I couldn't remember exactly where Zoey had gone pee.

You have to use this detector in a pitch dark room....  I think most UV lights have this limitation, even for the professionals.  At our old house, we had a pro carpet cleaner come in and treat pet stains, and they could only do this at night with their UV detector, so the cleaners were over late at night to detect and treat.

When I used the Simple Solution Spotter, the urine showed up as very pale, dull yellow spots on my dark thick brown carpet.  Zoey has a habit of starting to walk away before she's fully finished peeing, so there were little trailing drips I had to track down - this was the hardest part of treating the stains.  Other than having to be on my hands and knees, staring hard at the carpet, it was easy enough to start at one area, and work my way backwards until I'd found all 3 spots she'd made.

I'm glad I bought the Simple Solution UV Urine Detector even though I've only had occasion to use it once, and amazon had a lower price than my local pet supply store.

Not that this has to do with the detector itself, but I found it helpful to use a manual pressure sprayer while treating the stains.  I found mine in the garden supply area of a hardware store.  Mine's larger than regular trigger spray bottles, and you can tilt it forward and downward to spray the carpet - something that's hard to do with a trigger spray bottle, as liquid would move away from the straw part of the trigger bottle, and nothing would come out.  This wasn't a problem with the manual pressure sprayer...  I'd fill it, pump it to build pressure, and I'd have plenty of stain treater to do the entire area.  This way, I didn't have to stop to refill the bottle, coming back to the carpet and trying to find where I left off.  Hope this tip helps!"

He is only 1 1/2 and pretty much still a puppy.  I live in a residential neighborhood and he is in an electronic fenced in yard.  Lots of people walk on the road and work in their yards.  Oscar found it necessary to charge the road and bark at anyone who walked up the road, even the lady who goes for a 6 am run!  He also barked at my neighbors when they mowed or walked in their yards.  If you have ever heard a beagle bark, they are very loud.  I was at my wits end, thinking I was going to have to get rid of him.  I decided to give this collar a try.  For $30-40, it could not hurt.  Oscar is a quiet little guy now.  He walks to the edge of our yard and sits and watches people walk by with their dogs without a sound.  He wants to bark, but knows that he will get a little spray if he does.  Love this product!  The lady across the street wants the info for her yorkie that barks at everyone seeing how well it works on Oscar.  Be sure to keep the spray full.  Oscar knows that if it is empty and he can get one bark out,  he is free to go crazy and bark.  He does sometimes get just one bark out to test it, but that is all.  Most of the time, he is silent and like the neighbors say, they would not even know he was here.  Well worth it if you have a dog annoying the neighbors!"

When we first received the Kakadu dog coat we were excited to find something water resistant with a warm fleece interior to help our short-haired dog stay warm during a true Northeast winter. The first issue was that the velcro around the neck would constantly come undone. We took matters into our hands and hand sewed the neck straps to turn the coat into a slip on. After that, the coat worked wonderfully, for about a winter and a half. About 14 months after purchase, the velcro on the belly straps became the new issue and will not stay strapped. Unfortunately I won't be able to sew the straps together like I did with the neck, so we are now looking for a more reliable option."

On NRG, our Frenchie had 3 large very hard poops per day. He would sometimes look like we was straining (like we do when we have very hard large poop...it can be painful). Normally, when our frenchie  was on Raw food he had 2 small, well formed (not hard) poops per day. I agree which other critics of NRG who state NRG contains more undigestible ingredients (i.e. fiber) which is why several critics of NRG on amazon say their dogs had larger, harder stool on NRG and had bowel movements more often.

Then we tried Honest Kitchen: Love.

Once our Frenchie was on Honest Kitchen: Love, his stool went back to 2 small well formed poops per day just like when we was on raw food, and no more painful poops."

I have an 11 year old golden retriever with relatively atrocious breath. Nothing - and I mean nothing - ever seemed to minimize the foul odor. And, since she is an open-mouth breather, I've been on a mission to find a product that allows us to stay in the same room with her without gagging (OK, slight overstatement, but you get the picture). Anyhow, Bright Bites actually do the trick. She LOVES them, they don't cause gastro-intestinal upset, AND her breath in monumentally more pleasant. I highly, highly recommend this product for any Dog mom or dad in pursuit of fresh breath for his or her canine companion(s)!

This didn't product do much to deter my cat, and was a pain in the rear for the humans. However, it would probably work for some cats, as well as have some other uses.

I don't like my cat to walk on the kitchen counters (I don't let humans do that either!!). Totally grosses me out. Cats walk around in their litter boxes! Mine doesn't bury her poop, which is a totally different story. I don't want to have to disinfect my counters every time I cook, just in case the cat's been up there. Only want to clean counters after cooking. We don't care if the cat gets on the couch or beds. We like to snuggle with the cat on that furniture in my house. To each his/her own. However, IF this sound bothers your cat, it would work well for training him/her to stay off of furniture or counter, or stay away from certain areas.

The problem for us was that the darn thing goes off every time you come near it, even on the low setting. If you turn it off while working in the kitchen, it makes that sound when you turn it back on, plus you have to remember to do that. If all you're doing is getting something to drink in the kitchen, then it's just annoying. We would hear it going off during the night and sometimes when no one is in the room. Things are still knocked off the counter, spilled, etc. Don't know how long she stays up there, but it's still happening just as frequently.

I'll share one thing that's helped me, because I've learned a lot of ideas from others sharing them in reviews. This cat suddenly started getting on the kitchen counter a lot more often than she had in the past. When there's a behavior change in anybody or anything, it's good to try to figure out what's been different since the time the behavior changed. I figured out that when I started putting her cat food into a pretty cookie jar instead of a sealed canister is around the time when the counter surfing amped up. Easy solution: the food went back to a sealed container. I'm still looking for an effective way to keep her from ever getting on the counters, but it's happening a lot less when she can't smell the food there. Wouldn't you be willing to climb a counter if you were hungry and smelled a luscious steak up there?

This product could be useful for other times when you want a warning or deterrent. Might work to deter toddlers from going where you don't want them to go. However, it's NOT loud enough to alert you to them getting to something dangerous, such as out the door to a pool or getting into something poisonous. More like getting a cookie between meals, or alerting you to them getting up after a nap."
1,product definitely worth money cat love use scratch lounge play survey point plot next attack lot fun watch think may tire two year still use daily item hold well use material shelf thick corner start come loose affect functionality item screw base door second third shelf prevent base bang door cat jump recommend another reviewer work great necessary improvise wedge something behind nt want damage door hope help,"This product has definitely been worth the money for me.  My cats love it,  they use it for scratching,  lounging,  playing and as a surveying point to plot their next attack...  It's a lot of fun to watch them on it.  I thought they may tire of it but after more then 2 years they still use it daily.

This item has held up very well for all that it is used.  The material on the shelves is not thick and some of the corners have started to come loose but it does not affect the functionality of this item.  I did screw the base to the door  between the second and third shelves just to prevent the base from banging against the door when a cat jumps in or off of it (this was recommended by another reviewer and has worked great).  It's not necessary to do that,  you can improvise and wedge something behind it if you don't want to damage the door.

I hope this helps!"

As far as I can tell, the hinges for the doors were glued/painted together. It feels sturdy, and looks sturdy, but when it comes down to the actual design of it, a smart dog that works on weak spots will not have a problem taking it apart. Also, when I opened it, I had at least three metal pieces that fell out of the box - not something that inspires confidence in a crate ostensibly designed for securing a stronger breed of dog."

Not only were the other UV clarifiers I looked at more expensive than this one but I would also have to purchase a seperate pump. I would have spent twice as much money to purchase them seperate. Another great thing about this UV/pump is that it is submersible so theres not a bunch of hoses running out of the pond and the UV is not mounted to the side of the pond so it doesn't take away from the natural look of the pond. I put this in my pond and it took about 4 days to completely clear my pond.{after I figured out there was a flow control valve and I turned it all the way up).Actually the pump was in my pond for about 12-14 days total and my pond was only about 60% clear but it was because the water flow valve was turned down, as of right now my pond is perfectly clear and the fish seem to be swimmimg around more instead of just staying on one side of the pond and at the bottom. The instructions are very vague and this is why I was not aware that there was a flow control nob on the pump because it is not clearly marked in the diagram. This is very important because if the valve is turned down the pump will  not pump the water through fast enough for the UV clarifier to clear up the water. I have a 500 gallon pond and the pump is only a 270gph pump. The flow nob is on top of the pre-filter cover so it looks more like it is there to lock the cover in place. Another complaint I have about this product is the smaller pre-filter (it has two) has to be cleaned about every 4-5 days or you will lose water output to the fountain head,But I think this is the case with almost every prefilter on any brand pump. I gave this pump 4 stars instead of 5 because of the vague instructions,the easily clogged prefilter and the size,it is very large (over a foot long and very bulky).I would not suggest this product for larger ponds because the 270 gph pump may not be strong enough. Despite a couple of negatives this product does exactly what it says it will do and is worth the money!!

Update 7/29/2012

Suddenly this product has stopped working!!! I noticed that the water in my pond was becoming green again. I cleaned the filters and placed the pump back in the pond. Everything seemed fine. I came back outside later that evening to check on the pond and the pump was not working!! I checked the breaker box to make sure the circuit breaker had not tripped (it had not).I left the pump unplugged for a couple of hours and plugged it back in and it started working again. The problem is it only works for a few hours and then it stoped working again. If I unplug it for a few hours then plug it back in it works but will eventually stop again....In the process of returning it to the seller for a refund!!!"

Minor grievances first. The packaging and way the bags are packed were changed as well. They are extremely tight and no longer come out easily. The bags themselves are also now connected in roll form and must be torn from each other. This while annoying I expect I could get used to, even if I never really came to like.

BUT, they also changed the bag dimensions as well. Not by much, but enough so that they are no longer tight and I can't expect them to stay up by themselves. They also appear to be shorter, but this could be simply perception only since the bag won't stay up.

End result is that I will be using garbage bags that are way too large instead since they won't fall in and will do the job I expect them to do.

Great job Clevercat; save a few pennies, kill the use of the product."

Boy did he change his mind!!!  He eats about three bowls of this every day and asks for  more.  His coat looks great, his stools are healthy and he is loaded with puppy-like energy (he's almost eight years old)!!!

As for the arthritis diagnosis below?  Well, my trusted doctor missed this call.  Nikko actually has an ACL injury and we are treating that in a completely different manner.  He is however, making great progress to which I must give some credit to the nutritional superiority of Premium Edge Dog Food.

****************
FORMER REVIEW:

OK, with the above title said, I'll qualify the statement in defense of Premium Edge dog food.  It seems like something he should love but he is a very spoiled Malamute Husky who has recently been diagnosed with arthritis.  Because of that, I have given him every kind of fresh fish and meat I can to get him to swallow his medicine.  Now he thinks he should have chicken cordon blue or baked salmon for every meal or he turns up his nose at it.

He also has developed a taste for the grocery store dog food that he seems to love (not a good thing).

I'm going to keep trying to get him to switch foods because I know in my heart that this dog food is better for him than the one he currently prefers.

I will definitely come back and update my review when he starts eating this brand.

Thanks

Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.

The way it usually works for me is:
*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*
""Where is it?""
*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*
With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.

It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.

Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.

The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.

Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.

A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.

I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.

I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.

Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""
These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick some liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.
Sometimes it squirts out in unpredictable directions or apparently blows air, because my one dog backs away when I squeeze.

I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."

The problem came when it was time to clean it.  First, it has indentations and ridges on the inside area, which makes it hard to clean if you use clumping litter.  Second, when I went to go dump it out, I banged against the side of my trash can to make sure everything is out before I wash it, like I do ALL of my litter boxes--and it nearly cracked in half. I had to throw the entire thing out.  I do this with all my litterboxes, and I have some that are literally years old, so it wasn't me. So, very cheaply made, and probably won't last very long.  I have two more, I bought 3 at once, so I'll have to see how long they last."

I wouldn't expect every cat to like this fountain when the water moves so smoothly and somewhat uninterestingly down the ramp. I thought the water moving would attract my cat but it is pretty hard to see the water at all. My cat was interested for 10 minutes and was done with it for good. The fountain is quiet, and yes, you have to clean it and monitor it so the pump doesn't burn out. Overall it was more trouble than it was worth. Not recommended. I would try the fountains that bubble or have the water free-falling down from the spout. At least it would attract my cat."

That said, installing this unit was a total pain in the ass.  I am a very handy person and expected the install to be a simple 20 minute task including drawing a template, cutting the hole, and screwing the unit in.  this was far from reality.  First off, the template was wrong.  I had to re-cut the hole a couple of times to get it right.  It was a couple inches off on height and too wide (I had to add some wood to prevent excessive gap).  Once the hole is corrected, the passageway pieces must be cut.  getting them cut correctly also was a total pain, and getting them to stay in place with the foam insulation pieces wrapped around them was even worse.  I ended up scrapping the foam because it wasn't working then insulating the gap around with spray-in foam (can be a total mess if you are not careful).  If your time and sanity is worth anything to you, spend a couple extra dollars for a better unit and save yourself a day of being pissed off."

This made less of an impact than vacuuming or spraying the carpet. I am done with this useless product. I will never use it again and I wouldnt recommend it even to my worst enemy."

However, don't fall for it. Eventually you're gonna want to buy those better tools so you might as well put the $20 you would spend on these towards those quality tools.

First of all these scissors are NOT sharp. I dunno why all the reviews state they are but they definitely aren't. Depending on your plants they may work but for any sort of delicate tasks you're going to have a tough time. They're also extremely wide so it won't be a clean cut, they kinda smash the plant in half. The finger holes are not rounded so using these, while not painful, is rather uncomfortable after a few minutes.

The tweezers seem like they'd be great because of how long they are. Unfortunately they are not very precise and open too wide when released. Trying to plant anything small, delicate, or in a tight area is impossible as they disturb substrate way too much when releasing and your plant won't be really set in. The only thing I've found them acceptable for is pulling trimmed leaves or shrimp molts out of my tank where basically no dexterity is required.

The only tool really adequate in this entire set was the sand flattener as it would be hard to mess that up.

So anyhow, I know this set is tempting because of the price but I really think you'll be better off buying a couple quality tools instead of trying to get everything with this set. If you're alright with spending $20 for a sand flattener and just look at the rest of it as extra then maybe this set will work for you.

Also, all of the tools will stick to a magnet EXCEPT the sand flattener. I'm not sure what material it's made out of but it doesn't stick to the magnetic strip I have in my stand to hold my tools."

I purchased these for my new 10.5 week old kitten.  My old trusty clippers that I have used on several of my cats over the last 15 years, were definitely not suitable for these little paws-just didn't cut effectively.  The new clippers (as indicated by many of the comments) turned out to be very sharp and were able to handle the small paws of a small kitten without any problem.  The bonus here if it were not enough that the clippers worked great... it was 1) the packaging which easily spells out how to use these (without guessing) along with diagrams; and 2) the direct communication you receive from the suppliers who without a doubt care about their product and the customer's satisfaction.  Feel free to ask them anything - these Vets are eager to help you with your little one's nail grooming.  It was a pleasure doing business with them, and I will definitely keep them in mind for future pet purchases.

I've changed my original 3 star to 1 star. I don't know what material outs being used to stuff this OR what the ""sherpa"" is but I've broken out in hives from touching it. I tried washing the cover- same result. I also have asthma and removing the cover caused me to need my rescue inhaler. I peeked at the stuffing and my first thought was ""fiberglass insulation"". I'm sure it's NOT fiberglass....that's what it resembles in appearance to me. I had intended for this to be used on our bed so my Yorkie wouldn't sleep under my pillows. She's just going to get her own pillows. This is way too expensive to be manufactured using low quality fabrics/fillers.

Buyer beware - if you have allergies, this may not be the dog bed for you. Especially if you would come in close contact with it or your dog after using it.
************************************************
I'm not sure about this purchase. The bed was shoved into a box too small. It bent the plastic rod intended to keep the top up. The rod pops out of the hole a lot.

I think the bed had an odor to it? I smelled something and the minute I put it on the floor my Yorkie started to attack it. Not in a playful way. I sprayed some febreeze on it and let it sit for several hours where she couldn't get to it. Will try it tonight. If she still reacts the same way I'll need to return it.

Aside from the rod popping out, it seems to be well made? It would be nice if this was offered in a fake fur instead of sherpa. Its not soft AT ALL."

process etc diet either even live long life full healthy one less arthritis less kidney issue less scratch etc raving fan,"I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and sadly, learned that vets don't ever get this chance. Veterinary colleges are funded by dog food companies and unfortunately, as one famous vet who wants to change all that, Dr. Pitcairn, realized, taught to treat the problem rather than discovering what's causing it and that usually relates to the diet. In fact, a tremendous increase in dog health issues can be traced back to the time that dog food companies started...when they stopped eating table scraps and began an all-processed high grain and high allergen and unnatural diet. Even though table scraps were full of dog toxins like onions, they STILL had less health issues than their process food preservative and poor balance counterparts of today.

Funny how we wouldn't feed our kids crackers every day but feel it's okay to only feed our dogs that--high grain, poor protein, cooked out vitamins, highly processed, low nutrients...dogs who, in nature, seek out more protein.

In fact, that is how new dog food nutrition studies began. Because vets realized that wolves and coyotes in the wild brought in for treatment if hit by a car, etc do not have the health issues our INDOOR dogs have. A wolf might be old and without fleas or tartar or itching and with a glossy coat.

So vets like Dr. Pitcairn began studying the cause of pets with chronic issues or developing common issues too young and finding what things were toxic and unnatural and what helped prevent poor things in their diet.

I live in the woods and have 3 dogs and have yet to have one flea because I follow this advice. In fact, I have strangers tell me (often) that my dog's fur looks like a cat's because it's so shiny. No itching. Never grew up begging for my food because theirs is complete. (It may be hard to break this habit once begun but easy if it never starts.)

I will only feed them 3 things: a diet I make from Dr. Pitcairn's recommendations, ( I have no ties to any of these but am an activist about sharing anything good or bad for pets)  Newman's Own canned dog food, or Flint River Ranch.
Why? First of all, as part of my own studies I visited dog food plants. Actually this was like the biggest wakeup call on the planet for me.  I watched as I was told the ""brilliant"" model of putting the factories near cattle processing. When a cow is dead or dying of anything...they never determine the cause...they pick it up in a bulldozer and go take it to the dogfood plant. I WATCHED this.

How can they do this? Do you see how you rarely see the term ""human grade meat"" on dog food? They don't have to be inspected if it's dog food. There are two different levels of acceptance...people cannot eat food riddled with tumors from lesions or cancer, it's okay if dog's do. According to the government regulations.  Humans are required to eat inspected meat of certain cleanliness standards and from cows processed for this reason (I don't eat meat anyway but still....)Dog food companies are not required to have such standards.

For reals.

So if you will recall the huge outbreak of botulism a few years back with sick dogs going to vets, dying, etc that they linked to dog foods then it happened a few months later...do you remember there were only about 5 companies that were labeled as unaffected? This was one, Newman's Own was one....why? They only use HUMAN GRADE meat. Their meat is inspected. They do not buy meat from downed cattle plants so they were released from any recall or report of possible affected products. The others bought meat from across the country at these places and it was found the cows were diseased but because they never have to check to find out what they cows died from when making them into food, it was passed along. Then it happened again a few months later. Then it happened again a year later. Yes, we hear about these things when dogs die en masse. We never, however, hear about dogs that just fall ill....

But it gets worse.  You may see a list of vitamins and nutrients across the back of a bag of dog food. But due to the way meat is processed, they bake it at astronomically high temps to try to kill off any lesions, puss, etc. I""m not making this up. But they ARE required to have these in there...so what happens? They all bake off. You are left with some grains, high allergens like corn, and you are basically feeding your dog crackers and by-products of downed cattle.

So, does your dog beg and salivate when you eat meat or any dinner for that matter? Does your dog dive into the grass to try to get greens and nutrients by eating grass when you go for a walk?

There is a reason.  In nature, if you gave a human baby a banana and a bunny they would pet the bunny and eat the banana. If you gave a hungry dog the same for dinner, they'd eat the bunny first. What part of the bunny do they eat first? the stomach.  Why? This is where they get their greens and nutrients...then the meat protein. The raw bones clean their teeth without splintering.

Yet, although we are against eating an all-processed diet, dogs in spite of begging and pleading, are now living shorter lives, with the highest health issues ever due to our thinking that it's better for them because a dog food company told us so...or vets who don't have classes in nutrition tell us so. But this isn't taught in veterinary schools and dog food companies fund and provide text books etc. I didn't say this...vets say this.

That is changing. There is a huge off-shoot of vets now learning to find the issue and the cause (usually food related) rather than treating the issue alone.  And it turns out most issues are cured by a proper diet.

In fact, look at your dog treats. If you see sugar in them you will realize how many dog food companies are motivated by money. And there are lots of dog treats even TARTAR CLEANING (they say) dog treats with sugar. Why? Your dog will crave them just like people do. You may also see loads of unnnatural ingredients and even toxins such as onion powder. Milo's dog treats have these. Your dog can't tell you what is slowly hurting their kidneys. It's up to you to read the labels. Dog food is not regulated. It's up to us to do that.

The first thing you will notice about this dog food is that it looks like cookies broken a part rather than machine-made little round circles. Why? Because it it. They use inspected human-grade meat and a balance of carbs, protein, etc. that is closer to the natural diet and what a dog needs. Then they can bake it at a regular temperature that doesn't bake these out, just like you would at home. The nutrients aren't baked out. They bake it in sheets, naturally, then just break them apart.

You may be skeptical...so give it a month or two. Take a picture of your dog's fur before (dead serious) then compare it to when it has time to grow after eating this....you will be SHOCKED. We show poor health in our hair and so do they.

I can actually walk up to people at a dog event and tell them what they feed their dog. I have yet to be wrong and I do it often. I don't mean what brand but even people who think they are feeding their dog premium food like Iams have no idea it's just processed crackers marked up and grains and downed cattle.

I actually point out to people the difference. I kid you not, a family barbecue, a neighborhood ""house crawl"", a restaurant that allows dogs outside....I can walk up and tell who gives their dog table scraps (without toxins like onions or avocados) or real food, or human grade food....I just say ""what do you feed your dog?"" and I've never been wrong. Their coats are SHOCKINGLY different and shinier, the dogs aren't itching, and they usually have better teeth and gums.  I have yet to be wrong.

One lady told me how she took her dog to vets for years and it had to have steroid shots, then she finally found a vet who knew about nutrition rather than saying ""feed him expensive dog food"" and assumed that was good...and the dog was cured.

Do I work for this company? No. I am a very active Amazon reviewer who speaks up heavily, especially when it comes to pets, in all my reviews of things I love or things I don't.  My dogs thrive on this but I will say, they are not fans of their dog treats. So I just look at labels and find all natural dog treats (charlee bear brand has good ones) I have no ties to this company whatsoever except for the fact that I used to only feed my dogs food I made until a vet who was an expert in nutrition told me about this (In fact this vet ALWAYS treats from the cause rather than the symptoms first...a rarity as to how vets are taught to heal.)

this was at a time I was too busy to cook and I didn't want to give my dog just canned food even though Newman's Own is equally as good as this...

the difference in coat was striking.  I have tried a couple other brands and one of my poms always starts scratching. This has amino acids and things that treat the coat and skin and it's perfectly balanced.

Depending upon where you live it may be cheaper to buy direct. I anxiously await the day they finally get this on Amazon with free shipping but it has not happened yet. I'd get it on subscription then.

There is a difference. There is a huge difference. I've spent years studying in order to be informed and I recommend few dog foods. This, however, in my opinion, is simply one that no other dog food has ever come close to when I read ingredients and balance of ingredients and look at how it's made and what kind of meat.

If you ate artificial and processed chicken mcnuggets every day you'd fall ill too. When our dogs do people rarely suspect the dog food...they live such short lives anyway....nothing should be off balance, artificial, preservative-laden, processed, etc in their diets either so that even if they live a long life it is a full and healthy one with less arthritis, less kidney issues, less scratching etc.

I am a raving fan."

Each time, the seams failed -- my dogs did not claw them or chew on them or damage them in any way. At first, the company was very responsive and very good about replacing them at no charge, including no shipping -- otherwise, I certainly wouldn't have kept getting more of them (no matter how much my two Samoyeds loved them). At first I thought it must have been something I was doing wrong with using and maintaing the cooler beds, but then I found reviews by other purchasers and I know now that it's simply a defective product.

I got the same explanation that other reviewers got -- that it was because I moved the beds around too much. I knew that wasn't the cause: one was always in an oversized crate and never moved; the other was always on carpet, and I only slid that one out of the way when I vacuumed. Then they said I must have stepped on it myself too much, which I didn't. Besides, on the company's website, they showed a full-sized pickup truck driving over it. Even if I did walk all over it (which, according to the instructions, you HAVE to do to ""activate"" the foam core!), I certainly don't weigh as much as a full-sized pickup.

Around the time I filed a replacement claim for Bed #8 (yes, it was getting beyond frustrating by this time, but my dogs really loved these beds), the company told me they'd changed their technology on how the seams were manufactured, but the latest one that failed (just this evening, as a matter of fact) was one of the newer ones. Now that they've changed their replacement policy and raised the prices, I'm not even going to try to replace the latest one that broke. I give up. And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before my last surviving one fails, too. Good riddance.

The sad thing is, it's a great product for as long as it lasts, but it certainly doesn't last long enough to get your money's worth. Both my dogs love them, and I'm not sure how they're going to adjust to not having them anymore. I think the company needs to take them off the market until they can manufacture a reliable product. This is absurd."

It's a little big for my dog, she's a medium sized breed and about 45 pounds.  This leash would be even better for a hard-pulling dog.  The spring clip that attaches to the d-ring of the collar is industrial, and the entire LONG length of leash feels like it's doubled over and stitched.  There's a really nice foam piece sewn in the handle of the leash, and that alone makes it more comfortable for walking.  No hard marks on your hands.  The best added accoutrement is the extra d-ring that can hold a roll of doggie baggies for easy clean up.  No more having to try to shove them in your pockets, you can just keep them on your leash by the front door."

The only thing I did not like was finding the matching collar.  Didn't see one, so ordered a diff manufacturer and the reds are diff.  The leash has a more orange cast to the red and the darker brick red rolled collar. Both reds are nice, but I am a perfectionist, so it bugs me.  I was told by my groomer to get a rolled collar, as they are best.  Who knew?"

1,like fact solution claim kill contact relatively inexpensive easy use portable nt well compare immerse flea soapy water thus kill since refuse cooperate jump soapy water since use seem effective hard prove negative say alone solve problem give benefit doubt please nt forget spray car seat floor mat btw vet say frontline longer work seem flea evolve sorry creationists point previous product frontline long work recommend cheristin effective expensive,"I like the fact that this solution claims to ""kill on contact"", is relatively inexpensive, is easy to use and is portable. I don't how well it compares to immersing the fleas in soapy water and thus killing them since they refuse to cooperate and jump in to the soapy water.
Since we have been using it it seems to be effective but it is hard to prove a negative so I can not say that this alone solved the problem but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt.
Please don't forget to spray your car seats and floor mats.
BTW: My vet says Frontline no longer works. It seems that the fleas have evolved (sorry creationists) to the point where previous products, such as Frontline, no longer work. She recommended Cheristin. It is very effective and very expensive."

We have a corgi that barks at EVERYTHING after two days of wearing this collar he only barks when the doorbell rings or the garage door opens and that's with only using the vibrate feature.

This collar is great and I can tell my dog is more relaxed now that he is not barking at every single noise."

My old cat wasn't taking to the new addition very well. I went through the ""proper steps"" of introducing them (slowly, etc). One cat started loosing her fur and just in general was moody. I took her to the vet twice. After realizing nothing was medical, the vet said to try Feliway with the disclaimer, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I figured it was worth the shot (and since it's almost half the price of PetSmart it didn't seem like a bad deal).

It took about a month before I noticed a real difference, but now the fur is growing back and she purrs again."

It worked great and he liked the flavor sprinkled on his food. But take note - due to his weight, about 18 lbs, he was to have two capsules a day based on the Cosequin directions.  Right after adding the second capsule to his food he began having diarrhea. Once I reduced the dosage back to one capsule a day the diarrhea went away. I've since learned that this is a common problem with Cosequin and similar supplements.  Just keep an eye on your cat's litter box.  My boy is now on one capsule a day and he doesn't limp anymore and his joint stiffness is much less noticeable.  Allover, a good product that has enhanced his well-being and made his mommy very happy."

Below is my original review.  Since this review I have bought another bag and they were TERRIBLE QUALITY.  The sticks, many of them, were skinny as twigs.  Many of the other sticks stank and were weird shapes.  This was a ""seconds"" batch.  It's tough because I know bestbullysticks.com sells perfect sticks from their own website---but when they sell to Amazon customers---I dunno---I think the ship Amazon the ones that cannot sell from their own site due to poor quality.  I will NOT be ordering from them again.  I will spend more--there are some that are about $10 more---but at least I won't feel annoyed that I got ""seconds.""  Read my original review too--it is still helpful in making your decision.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I've ordered three packs of this exact item from Best Bully Sticks/Amazon.  When I ordered from their own branded Website, the sticks were immaculate and had a branded label.  They were all the same size and color and seemed uniform.  I got them on sale from the brand Website and so paid what I do currently from Amazon.  When I went to order more, the sale was no longer on and they were significantly more expensive.  Amazon had the same Best Bully Sticks (odor free) and the same product count for the sale price I paid.  Excellent.  However, when I received the bag it wasn't labeled, the sticks were splintered and the sizes were not uniform and seemed dryer than my original purchase.  They seemed like seconds.  But, because of the price, and the fact that my dog didn't seem to mind--I bought them again from Amazon.  This time, though the bag was again unlabeled, the sticks were uniform and of the same quality as my first batch.  These sticks do get gooey---a good thing---when your dog starts to chew them.  So, if they do appear dry or brittle, this does soften almost immediately.  I have an 8 month old sheepdog puppy and this size seems to last him about 20mins!  If your dog is a heavy chewer and a Bully Stick addict, don't expect these or really any 6"" sticks to last more than an hour--MAX!  Again, great deal as one bully stick from Petco can be 4-5 bucks!"

The coiled wire design provides an unpredictability that cats love and the cardboard ends give them something fun to pounce and chew on. I think it accurately recreates the experience of chasing a bird, fly, chipmunk, baby squirrel, or other similarly elusive prey.

Don't think twice, but definitely buy two!"

It is very easy to install and it keeps my baby safe while he is riding in the car with me. My biggest concern was finding something that would prevent the airbag from hurting my baby if it did ever deploy and this eat is wonderful as it sits above the seat cushion raising the dog up to a safe level which protects against the airbag. I have a 3 month old, 6  pound puppy, and he has room to move around, sit, lay, and even chew on his favorite toy. Great for smaller dogs"

Among the other things the vet prescribed to help her is a daily dose of Pepcid and an appetite stimulant which she takes every 3 days. She's not allowed to have a lot of protein (part of kidney failure), but the vet advised a little would be OK to disguise her pills in a small bit of food. We tried everything to get her to take the pills - tuna, cream cheese, regular cheese, cream, whipped cream, ham, turkey, baby food, etc. Although she usually loves all of these things (she comes running when we shake the whipped cream can!), she would not touch them when the pill was mixed in. We tried adding the pills whole as well as crushing and mixing them. No go.

The vet suggested force-feeding her the pills. This includes wrapping her up in a towel while my husband forces her to open her jaw and throws the pill in while. I shoot a syringe full of water in forcing her to swallow the pill. Sounds pretty straight forward, but its not. Not to mention its stressful on us all. When we were finally able to get the pill in her mouth it actually started foaming!

Needless to say, we were very frustrated and didn't know what to do. Then we found these. She loves them and hasn't even noticed the pill. We purchased both the Chicken and Salmon in case she gets bored of one flavor. We're crossing our fingers that she doesn't wise up. But they have literally been a life-saver!  Thank you Greenies!"

Living on the west coast its gets very dry, barely any humidity, and I think my kitties feel it. SO I wanted to try them on something that may help. Sadly, it isn't working out.
I have three cats. Two of which who eats anything and everything, and one a picky little bugger. I mixed this food with their normal food and they wouldn't even touch it. Not even with their regular food in the same dish. I put their regular food in a dish by itself and they chowed down. Sadly to say neither one of my three babies do not like this food.
I am not saying it horrible, it is just not a good fit for my three fur babies. Happy kitties, happy mommy. Sad kitties, sad mommy.
The price wasn't too bad, considering it was a add on item, I think I will go donate it to the animal shelter, in hopes that some of the babies there will eat it. I just cant throw it away knowing there are kitties who doesn't have food. :("

I would never recommend them!  I transported my larger cat (she weighs 16 lbs) to the vet in the large size carrier.  While there was plenty of room for her, it was not stable enough to transport her safely.  She had torn two holes in the mesh side by the time I got there.  The vet's office is less than 3 miles from my home.  The second problem was that the bottom of this carrier did not provide enough support for my cat.  As I carried her, the bottom of the carrier bulged underneath.  I ended up not even using the handles--I held the carrier using both arms so I could support the bottom with one arm.  The third, and very dangerous, situation was:  even though I zipped the top completely, she found a way to squeeze her head out of the velcro-sealed end.  Luckily, I had her on the front floor of the passenger side and saw her the moment she stuck her head out.  I was in the middle of traffic and had to push her head back in and keep my hand on the top of the carrier for the rest of the trip.  I almost had an accident because of this useless product.  Please, please don't try to transport a cat in it."

Such a simple design but oh so effective. I purchased the small for a 19 lb Cavapoo. (Originally tried the small/medium but was much too big). I would say that the small is great for dogs in the 12-20 lb range and the width of the harness is probably 3/4 inch so perfect for smaller dog. The harness was easy to put on - the top stays clipped and easily fits over the head, and then the bottom strap clips behind the front legs. MUCH easier than other harnesses I've tried. The harness was easily adjusted while my dog was wearing it. The part that goes around the front of her chest is on it's tightest setting. I would say that this measurement is probably more important than the girth measurement unless your dog has a VERY wide girth. I did not want to tighten it too much based on concerns other reviewers had about chafing but it needs to be snug and I will only use while we are walking on leash. My dog is 9 months old so likes to sniff at everything and is very excited to see other people/dogs. So during our first walk of the day with the new leash, as soon as she pulled ahead her leash became taught, I used the command ""with me"" at the same time as the chest part of the harness pulling and she immediately slowed down. She did this a few more times but then walked 4 blocks without pulling AT ALL!!!!. It's uncanny how easily this seems to have fixed her pulling. We did not meet another dog so that will be the true test but I cannot praise this product enough. A few minor negative comments (which are all small): since the clip on the leash attaches in the front of her chest, the leash hits her upper front leg (thigh) while she walks so you feel it bouncing off her her. I did not really like the feeling of this but will deal with it since the harness helps so much. I also found her leash got twisted a lot, which was probably something to do with the bouncing off the leg (it was not twisting in my hand but at the clip where it attaches). Since she is a pup and doesn't always walk in a straight line, you have to swing the leash under her face every time she switches sides. These are all minor points and the positives FAR outweigh any negatives. Truly an awesome product. I was not paid for this review, nor did I receive any free products - I just really like this product!!"

I was very disappointed with the quality and the short string. I found that in order to play with your cat with this toy, you had to bend over to use it. I am 5'4"" and this did not work for me. Even much shorter people probably will find the string too short. If you are a little person, or a child, this toy might be an ok length for you. It does not work well if you are an adult height.

This cat toy would be 4 stars if the string was longer. Oh how I hate wand toys with short strings!! Not very useful. I will probably cut the toy off of the end."

I wanted orange because that is my moms favorite color. I was given a call a week later from a lady you could hardly understand what she was saying. She told me the orange was sold out and asked if I would like another color instead. So I told her I would take teal. I never received an email or phone call. So after a week I tried the tracking number from the original email. UPS told me they would tell more about my delivery once they received the package from the supplier. So I called the company back and spoke with a lady who said the order was never placed, but she would place it today and the package would go out today or tomorrow. I waited another week and my package had not arrived. So I called them back thank goodness I had saved the number because they don't list a number anywhere I could find. So I asked the guy on the phone and he said yes the teal one shipped out yesterday. Well the package arrived and looked to be in good condition and provided a sample of material on the outside to show me the color was teal. So I wrapped the package and my mom opened it on Christmas day to find out the color was actually bright green. Im glad my mom could live with green because I really did not want to deal with the company anymore. I personally will not be buying anything else from the company because there customer service is not good and even after they changed the order I stilled did not get my second choice. The product itself looked ok, but it is very light Im worried the poles will bend. Ill find out more after my mom uses it a few times."

He's slowed a bit this last year, and then started having a limp, especially when he first gets up and about after a nap. Sometimes it would continue all day, so we cut back the exercise.

A guy I met walking my dogs told me about this stuff so I bought it, level 1 as he's about 40 lbs. This was 4 weeks ago and we give him a half tablet morning and eve.

As there's no 'control' I can't say for sure this did the trick but, for one thing it had no ILL effect and he has been back to his 4 legged self the last week or more. So I will continue it going forward and would say for $30 versus the $150-200 we would have spent at the vet on xrays etc to be told, nothing is wrong - it's a bargain.

Dec 30 update - I have to believe it was these pills, he's been 100% with very few exceptions ever since we started him on this product. Highly recommend to dog lovers with ailing pets."

I had read some reviews which were very mixed and now I know why. This leash worked sort of OK for about a dozen times, even though I couldn't stop a dog quickly because the tabs on top were so stiff and didn't glide. And I bought it to help out a friend with her dog who can't walk very well, so I'm not using this everyday. But then the other day one leash extended and wouldn't retract while out on a trail. Not good since now I had no way of bringing that dog in. So I tried to open it up and see if I could fix the retraction, but after unscrewing all the screws the handle would not separate, so no chance of trying salvage the leash. If this was $10 I wouldn't be writing this but it's almost $40 and pretty expensive for only about 12 walks. I think the maker should pull this from the market and fix these problems. NO ONE SHOULD BUY THIS IF YOU CARE FOR YOUR DOGS."

For me, the answer is a resounding NO, but your mileage may vary.

=== The Good Stuff ===

* It is a clever design, and folds up into a roughly 13"" x 5"" x 4"" envelope and weighs 12.2 ounces. Extended, it is 27"" in total length, about right for someone of average height.

* The handle has a squeeze bar, which opens the jaws when pulled. Releasing the handle allows the spring to snap the jaws closed. There is no mechanism for attaching a plastic bag.

* The scooper is built out of a hard plastic with a shiny finish. It is relatively easy to clean under a garden hose.

=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===

* I am not sure I understand the usefulness of the folding function. It makes it smaller, but there is no obvious way to carry it in the folded configuration. Even worse, when folded, the handle is right next to the ""business end"" of the scooper, not exactly a pleasant thought.

* There are a few nooks and crannies in the scooper mechanism, making ideal spots for ""stuff"" to collect.

* The mechanism isn't as smooth as it should be, and occasionally sticks. This is just one of those products that I want to work flawlessly.

=== Summary ===

To be honest, I'd rather just carry bags and scoop things up the old fashioned way. If you are worried about the sanitary side of things, I'd rather carry a few disinfecting wipes instead of this scooper.

=== Disclaimer ===

I received this as an evaluation sample. I have no interest in the company or any of its employees."

It has a removable bottom pad - great for cleaning up ""accidents"". It has removable arched supports so it can stand up or fold down.  I'll probably take them out for shoulder carry.  Both ends zip open, but there's also a quick ""escape hatch"" on one end with an 8""w x 7""h drop-down door.

We are on our second outer shell. This was due to the first one having zipper problems and when I contacted the company about this, they were totally unwilling to help at first. After sending them several emails, the very best they could and would do for me, was to send me a new outer shell at no charge, but I still had to pay for shipping. Now, this was after several emails and practically begging them. Because at first they were just going to charge me full price and shipping. Though I went ahead and did this, I was very disappointed that they were unwilling to stand behind there product that was less than 6 months old and useless due to the zipper on the door being broken. If you look in there description, it very clearly states, and I quote ""Product Quality Guarantee, 100% Money Back Guarantee, Customer Satisfaction Guarantee"". When I asked them about this, they stated that was only good for 30 days... Mind you, I was not asking for a refund, I just wanted an exchange. So, even after agreeing to pay the shipping and receiving the new outer shell, though it works... the quality and fabric is not tough at all, though the zippers are ok thus far, the fabric has a small rip on the top, so thankfully we can still use it for now, but I already know that they won't replace it unless I pay for it. Doesn't everything come with atleast a one year warranty with??? Well, not this crate!!!"

However,  he can't be left untethered or he's all over the place and I don't care for standard belt tethers as they either allow to much or not enough movement.

And, since the booster is elevated, I can tuck my purse and other items under it. Got my seat back -- bonus!
Fit: Perfect for a 13lb Jack Russell mix, without offering too much space. He can curl into a ball or stretch and lounge a bit with his head over the edge. Or, as he prefers, he can sit up and check out the world. He loves it. I love it. Hope y' all love it ;)"

I got the 12"" like the calculator on the leerburg website recommended, but it slipped down to the base of his neck within a minute instead of staying at the top like it is intended to, and could be slipped over his head. I exchanged it for an 11"", which was sent to me rather quickly, and it seems a bit tight. It's difficult to clip on and doesn't have much extra material when pulled on like it should, but I can fit two fingers under it, it stays at the very top of the neck, and it can't be slipped over the head. I guess a tad bit too small is better than too big when preventing an aggressive dog from bolting if his prong collar comes off."

My cats love tuna, salmon and mackeral (people food---fresh and/or canned) so I got the salmon flavor to try first.
I put it out in the morning expecting howls of delight.  What I got was two cats who sniffed and refused to even taste this stuff.

I left it out all day in hopes that hunger would drive them to at least try it.  They went all day without a taste.

I gave up and put it in my labrador's bowl (in other words into the garbage disposal...LOL!). He sniffed it and turned away from it.  Left it there for two more hours and he would not touch it. In nine years I have never had my lab refuse to eat something, and have been grossed out by some things he has chosen to eat.
Went to pet store after this experiment and got five other brands of fish based food.  Both cats ate all other brands even though they would much prefer real fish (based on how slowly they ate the canned vs how fast they scarf the real deal).

Wish I knew what was in this that grossed out my pets!"

That seems a little nuts to me since CKH had a pretty loyal and big following among cat owners. But that aside...

This is pretty good cat grass, if not a tad expensive (not outrageously so, however) and you only get four ounces in the package. The grass does grow very well though and I would estimate that the germination was probably 90-percent of better. I grew a 12x12-inch flat of it (using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-Gro-72986510-Organic-Choice-Potting-Mix-16-Quart-currently-ships-to-select-Northeastern-Midwestern-states/dp/B000BQLVNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle-Gro 72986510 Organic Choice Potting Mix, 16-Quart (currently ships to select Northeastern & Midwestern states)</a>&nbsp;and grew it under a small fluorescent lamp for the first week (until it was about four or five inches high). If you keep it in a fairly bright area and well watered, it will grow for a long time (or until the cats have munched it into submission).

The cats absolutely love the grass and began sneaking into while it was still under the grow light and knocking off the plastic lid I was using to hide from them (and good luck with that). So, grows very well, cats love it, is a little high priced but not too bad--but if you search online, you can find farmers selling red rye grass for cats in much bigger quantities (just read reviews so you get good-quality seed)."

Our Amstaff completely went downhill! Her skin broke out so badly and she itched so much she tore herself open and raw and her back paws were covered in blood from the itching. Her skin got so bad she was shuffling and unable to extend her legs comfortably. I honestly thought she'd been hit by a car or kicked by one of our horses but it was just her sores had made movement so painful. She was stuck in her bed for days and wouldn't eat or get up to drink. The point is, this is a very deceiving dog food and I would say is as comparable as the cheapest ""atta boy"" dog food. We've since gone back to our normal dog food and she's slowly recovering."

Just push the button directly beneath the blade to unlock it, pull the blade forward first then slide upward to lift it out. When putting on a new blade, slide it over the metal tab on the clipper and push the blade in, making sure it clicks into place. The clipper comes with a size 10 blade. It's very short. I use it on my bichon's feet, bum, and sometimes his stomach. Since his fur is slightly sparse and he has a little cow-print on his skin, I like the 3/4"" HT for his head and body in the summer. It's short enough to keep him cool, but plush enough to cover his skin and give him a little poof. I like the size 7 (regular or skip tooth) for his body in the fall.

Side note on the blades: The 7 and 10 blades cut my dog's hair like butter. The 3/4"" HT works well but is slightly prone to snagging.

One thing to bear in mind, the blade can get hot. When I first started clipping my dog, I was a slow and careful newby -- thus, it was on longer causing the blade to get warmer with time.

With practice you get faster. I also tend to switch between blade sizes for my dog's body, feet, and head. These behaviors mitigate the issue."

Basically my cat never set foot in it except one night when he decided it apparently looked enough like a litter box that he peed in it. No matter how many times I washed it, the smell never came out. One day he peed in it again. Then I threw it out.

Two stars instead of one because it is soft and if I were a cat, I certainly would consider sleeping in it."

(Sample from instruction booklet intro: ""Every pet owner may often curious about their pets gone done. With this camera, pet owners can observe a consistent line of kids"". --Well, yeah! I'm in!) Anyway, my dog keeps getting out of the fenced yard, which includes some woods, and I couldn't figure out how. So I dropped 25 bucks on this gizmo, and a few more on a micro sd card, charged it up, and stuck it on his collar this morning. When I came home this evening he was out, and I had 40 short videos of his ""consistent line of kids."" You know, what he'd been doing all day. And I found out (a) that he climbed a fallen tree to jump over the fence, and (b) that my next door neighbor is a really nice guy--even when no one's looking. B/c he was sweet to my dog when the dog got into his garbage. (I didn't know until I watched the video that the camera records audio too. And the neighbor didn't even cuss.) My wife and I got a good laugh seeing the world through the dog's eyes for a day. Recommended.

Update: Well, the 3rd day of use the dog came back w/o the camera. The clip by which it attached to the collar had broken off. So I have removed 1 star. Maybe it's better for cats & smaller dogs."

The product arrived and was neatly collapsed into a square.  I opened it up to install it in my car and found that it did not include any directions. I think that I installed it correctly by wrapping one strap around the head rest and one around the seat itself.  The carrier is assembled into a square by zipping it up.  The zippers do not secure the booster seat at all.  Once the dog leans against it the zippers come unzipped and it comes undone (it does not work as seen in the displayed picture).  I attached pictures of how this worked with my 13 pound dog.  I definitely would not recommend this as a car seat carrier.  It could be used as a pet carrier for a smaller dog or cat because it does have snaps that would secure the ""box"" position.  It has a cover and a screen that the animal could look out of.  It is well ventilated.  The one thing I did like about this compared to another booster seat I had used in the past is that it had the latch attached at the bottom of the carrier.  My dog did not use the bathroom while riding in it - but I imagine it would be quite a mess.  It doesn't seem like it would catch any liquids from soaking through.  Please note: I received a discount for my honest review of this portable dog booster car seat carrier.  I personally used this pet seat carrier and these are my honest opinions. I hope they were helpful."

The hook for the leash is in the front and who walks IN FRONT of their dog? If you're buying a harness, it's probably because your dog pulls the leash pretty hard. If so, the dog definitely walks in front. It fits my dog really well, but the straps buckle & rub in the direction of where you're holding the leash. It's because when pulling, it has to wrap around the side of the dog unless you're directly beside the dog. Even if your dog is very well trained and does walk directly on your side, it still buckles and slides towards you some. My vet and dog walkers have all commented on how strange it was too.

Fits well, but it just doesn't make any sense to me. It just doesn't make any sense to me."

If he doesn't get his Dasuquin, after only a few days he cannot jump up onto the sofa or chase the squirrels in the yard.  With the Dasuquin he has no trouble jumping or running and unless you were close enough to see all the grey on his muzzle, you would think he was only a teenager.

(CritterTrail and Habitrail type environments are terrible homes for small rodent pets btw). I have this type Lixit bottle with both the straight and tilted nozzle. When looking for water bottles for my gerbil habitats my biggest frustration was that most smaller water bottles can only be attached to cage bars, and the ones that can be hung over the lip of a tank are so long they get buried too easily by bedding, so I end up usually having to hang water bottles in odd ways with wire mesh type contraptions and masking tape. I also have one terrarium where the lid doesn't fit properly over the hanging bottle lip. I love this Lixit bottle type because I can place it in the tank or bin and it stays securely sealed against the side of the wall. The bottle is easy to remove and refill, and I love the little indicator. It's perfect for a tank or bin with 1-3 gerbils (or other rodents). That said, it is plastic and thus chewable, so it is important to check the bottle daily to ensure it hasn't been chewed through and thus leaked out. But I have had these bottles for months and so far no major chewing damage. If I do start to see chewing damage I can use wire mesh to deter it, but I would like to see a similar concept botttle that is better guarded to prevent chewing, and also one that holds a larger volume by being longer horizontally (rather than vertically) so the spout can easily remain above the bedding."

It is easy to adjust, easy to put on. You just slip it over your dog's head and fasten the buckles. The buckles take a second to figure out. It seems very secure. Then you drive with it. The biggest problem is the mechanism that holds the back part in place- they made it so that you can use one of two loops based on your dog's chest size. However, the only thing that holds it in to the loop is a small snap. If you have a dog who moves around a lot (mine is pretty hyper, he doesn't sit still), the snap pulls apart immediately, then the thing twists around the body, so the part that should be on his back can rotate, and basically gives him a lot of space to wiggle around (and gives him a much longer reach). Also, it has a hook that allows you to walk your dog with it (front chest clip), but it doesn't fit closely enough. Again, a problem with the snap, as well as the fit. So it moves to the side when my dog pulls, then basically pins his front leg backwards when it gets stuck. This is a good idea in theory, but doesn't work well in practice. It's a shame, because the metal fittings seem very safe, but with the harness moving all over the place, the dog isn't secure. I need something else."

But as I lost the manual that came with it, I can't say for sure.  It's a one touch proposition, but it's not intuitive.  There are two buttons, one of them is self explanatory.  It shows a picture of a fish eating.  Press that button and the dispenser rotates the food chamber and deposits food into the tank.  How much food is deposited depends on which setting you select on the face of the food chamber.  Min leaves a small opening for food to fall out of the chamber when it rotates.  The max setting will empty the container in just a few short cycles.  I use flakes and leave mine set to min for a 20 gal tank containing maybe 8 small fish.

The second button is labeled 12H and 24H.  What exactly do they do?  I haven't a clue.  The dispenser does not start when this setting is changed from one position to the other.

The unit has been working, as evidenced by bits of food scattered next to the opening at the tank top, but I've not seen or heard it operate (on it's own) since I put batteries into it and installed it on the tank several months ago.  Knowing the batteries might be getting old, I sought the instructions, so I could reset the unit when I replaced the batteries.  I couldn't find the manual so I looked on the unit for a label indicating manufacturer and model number.  Nothing!

I checked Amazon for automatic feeders and, judging by the picture, this is the unit.  So I Googled ""Cambridge Aquatics"".  Again NOTHING.  You'd think the company has some kind of web presence - a place to download owner's manuals perhaps?  Not this company.  After 15 minutes I gave up trying to locate instructions.

I'm not saying don't buy this unit.  But if you do. DON'T LOSE THE INSTRUCTIONS.

You might try other mainstream offerings instead though."

0,teach child care fish properly buy 1g mini bow undergravel filtration sound great right maybe think filter intake gravel circulate muck filter case undergravel filter simply plastic grate allow poo settle bottom disturb easily anyway poo remove water manually pour good luck soon start move thing around tank poop start swirl around little difficult save clean top water water change poop swirling besides 1g really nt big enough fish unless intend keep unhappy betta something research proper fish care get something proper filter make job little easy,"This is how you teach your children how to NOT care for fish properly: Buy them a 1g Mini Bow. Undergravel filtration sounds great, right? Maybe you're thinking that the filter intake is under the gravel, circulating the muck out of there and through a filter. This is not the case. This undergravel ""filter"" is simply a plastic grate that allow the poo to settle down to the bottom and not be disturbed so easily.

Anyway, the poo is only removed from the water when you manually pour it out. And good luck with that too, because as soon as you start moving things around in the tank, all that poop starts swirling around! It will be a little difficult for you to save some of the clean top water for your water change, now that there's poop swirling!

Besides all that, a 1g really isn't big enough for any fish, unless you intend on keep a very unhappy betta or something. Research proper fish care, and get something that has a proper filter on it. It makes your job a little easier."

The first night after recieving the product I read the instructions and put it on my dog ""Teska"". She is very well trained and is used to having collars and leashes taken on and off had no problems puting it on. The first real test was my girlfriend coming home. My dog knows that barking is not ok and does so anyway. She head my girlfriend get home and barked once and got an imidiate beep and shock. This stunned her and made her stop she looked at me and then barked again and recieved another shock. She stopped barking for a good while. Again, later that week friends came over and she barked but she was so excited that she kept barking. I supose that with each bark the shock gets worse. It shocked her so bad she started screaming. She got outside and screamed and ran in circles getting shocked and screaming. I ran to her picked her up and took the collar off. She was ok just a little frightened. I just wanted to say that that this product really does work and I still use it, just be careful with a dog that's new with it. Thanks to this product we all now get peaceful nights sleep and for that I am eternally greatful."

Right after I first purchased my Betta, he began to look splotchy. I tried several treatments, even one for ich but I was pretty sure it wasn't ich. I then ran across Betta Revive and when I tried it he cleared up within 2 or 3 days and looked great, but very slowly began to ""resplotch"". Frustrated, I didn't try any other treatments  because they all failed and he began to look worse than ever. I thought I had done everything according to the instructions of each medication and removed the ""carbon filters"", but I had a bag of purigen that I left inside since it wasn't carbon , so I did a complete water change and removed the purigen. He was looking really bad and had no energy, so I decided to try the revive again as a last resort and sure enough, he has cleared up completely and is re-energized and is as beautiful as he was when I first purchased him. Its been a couple of weeks and still doing great.  What is in this stuff?? I have no idea, but I am keeping a supply on hand and will use it at the first sign of a flare-up. If you have a sick fish, this is definitely worth a try. I'm sure it won't cure every problem but has been amazing for me."

0,want something narrow tall put front slide glass door cat hang another cat tree awesome figure would similar unfortunately big cardboard junkpile never buy majestic pet pro cat ultimately fun pile broken glass let bar set relatively low con instruction horrible luckily assembly somewhat intuitive go together rather quickly carpet low quality mat pilled month whereas cat tree house year zero issue like cat house size shoe box unusable pillar cardboard screw pull cardboard three time thus far find second level collapse sharp screw hang problem manufacturer nt use cardboard price much inclined recommend something go pet http wwwamazoncomgpproductb0091olfqerefwmsohsproduct ieutf8 psc1 like say year look brand new,"I wanted something narrow and tall to put in front of my sliding glass doors for the cats to hang out on.  I have another cat tree that is awesome so I figured it would be similar.  Unfortunately, it's not.  it's a big, cardboard junkpile and I will never buy from Majestic Pet again.

Pros:
-Cats will ultimately have fun in a pile of broken glass if you let them so the bar is set relatively low

Cons:
-Instructions are HORRIBLE.  Luckily, assembly is somewhat intuitive so it went together rather quickly
-Carpet is very low quality.  It matted and pilled after just a month; whereas my other cat tree has been in the house for a year and zero issues like this
-Cat house is the size of a shoe box and unusable
-Pillars are cardboard.  Screws pull out of cardboard. 3 times thus far, I've found the second level collapsed with a sharp screw hanging out. Again, these problems are not had with other manufacturers because they don't use cardboard

For the price, I'd be much more inclined to recommend something from Go Pet.  I have http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091OLFQE/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and like I said, a year in and it looks brand new."

For reference, Cricket is a 15 pound Maine Coon mix. She likes sitting or laying on the window bed when I put her up there, but she doesn't like getting into it herself because it's a little springy. I had grand plans of creating tons of window seats at different heights for her to jump up to, but she only gets on the bed herself if I put treats up there. The suction cups are impressive. I did clean the window and the cups with Windex wipes before sticking the cups to the window. I haven't had any issues with suction. The brown material covering the bed is kind of slick, but I think if you put a blanket or pillow on it, it would really help. I do put treats on it to try to entice her to lay on the bed. I don't know why I'm so concerned that she enjoy laying on the bed, when she's happy watching squirrels from the floor. I included a picture of her on the seat (I put her there) so you could see her size compared to the seat."

Great results on dogs that suffer from minor and severe skin rashes from allergic reactions, yeast infections, or from flea bites. Even though it's still pricey here and you have to bathe your dog 3-days in a row, the vet charges $27.00 dollars for an 18oz bottle of a similar product. While these are only 8oz bottles, there is just enough shampoo to bathe a small or large dog the recommended three times. For an extremely large dog you may need more than one botte.

Bought this as a Hail Mary for my beloved Australian Shepherd suffering from hemangiosarcoma as this stuff supposedly boosts the immune system, can shrink malignant tumors, and can significantly prolong (by months) the life of a dog suffering from cancer. These conclusions were based on a single, small study done by the Univ. of Pennsylvania Vet School. Unfortunately, due to the particulars of my dog's cancer fight, she was only able to take this stuff for 3.5 days, it did not make one bit of difference in terms of prolonging her life or in fighting the cancer. Given the cost of this item, I had high hopes I'd found a silver bullet against the cancer, but it was not to be.  At the end of the day, this is one of those Chinese mystery medicines that have indeterminate origins, a clever but unverifiable origin story, and a hefty price tag. Cannot recommend this stuff unless you're sure you've got at least 2-3 weeks to administer this to see if it will actually work."

I have 4 cats and 4 cat boxes because of course each cat has its own preferences. I have even tried using all forms of ""litter"" itself and have ALWAY HATED the cat boxes.

Now I have to say this system is very easy to use... and we are down two 3 cat boxes (2 are the breeze). The ktty urine goes right through the pellets and onto a pee pee pad (completely hidden) and the soild matter is just scooped, pellets shaken off with specail kitty scoop and tossed. I clean soild waste daily and only change the pee pee pad every week 1/2... NO URINE SMELLS AT ALL!

USE/Cost: I buy my breeze pellets and pads through Amazon...much cheaper than local and come right to my door. The pellets I have not ever removed but just add more about every two weeks and the pads I change every week 1/2.... over all not bad since I was buying very expensive litter and changing almost weekly.

I am hoping to convert the 3rd box over as well but we have a very PICKY pusian who hates ANY other cat to share her kitty box..."

Very hard to program.  Got locked out by it and had to start over from scratch by taking the batteries out.

I didn't know it would take the strength of Hercules to snap the plastic clips to the wires to assemble it. I can see why some people give up on the plastic clips and use nylon zip-ties to hold the wire sides together.
I also didn't know that the wire grate (also not a pull-out), is so close to the bottom of the cage that using litter, instead of paper, isn't a good option. There's not enough room to add enough litter to make it useful.
The whole design of the base is another issue.  There are raised areas on both ends of the bottom of the base, where the seed/water cups fit, making it very inconvenient to fit paper towels/newspapers in the base. Rounded corners in the base and the grill also mean that if you plan to use papers you'll have to trim them to fit.  I ended up making a paper template to cut a section of heavy-duty plastic shelf liner to fit the bottom of the cage.  I can take it out and wipe it off and re-use it.
The cage does do a good job of containing the feathers and seed hulls.
If Hagen is reading this, a couple of simple changes to the base would make these cages much more user friendly.  The base height should be increased by an inch, the base corners should be squared, and a pull-out grill and an easy clean pull-out drawer should be added.  Their claim that a drawer would only make a mess is simply not true.
Bottom line for me, I'm not happy, and I can't recommend this line of cages."

It does kind of work, but it's cheaply made and there are problems with it that make it not worth the money. I have 2 cats, so since it's receptacle is small, it must be given attention every 3 or 4 days--not much different than a litter box you have to scoop. And since the cleaner only picks up ""bigger"" items, stuff gets left in the box and must be scooped by hand. And worse than that, urine clumps often get broken into small peices that stay in the box and sometimes they even stick to the bottom--this is exacerbated by the fact that the automatic scooper doesn't really scrape all the way to the bottom. All of this together means, the devices needs lots of attention and isn't that much of a step forward from a ""manual"" litter box."

For once in my life, I would like to receive a Chinese manufactured product that actually has quality control and workmanship.  I realize that all American jobs have been shipped overseas to take advantage of the Chinese slave laws so greedy people can get richer and everyone else can starve, but if we're going to be stuck getting products from the Chinese, might it not be worth it if someone could show them how to drill a hole completely?  Is that really too much to ask?  There is nothing like using a hammer and a bolt to drive through that last bit of thin faux wood so you can actually use the bolt in the manner it was intended.  Oh, and could they be taught to cut a hole in the fabric so that after the faux wood is cleared, there is no other impediment?  And must all the metal pieces arrive rusted?  At least the cubby holes are the faux wood and not just fabric - it makes the product a bit sturdier.  I have to vacuum now - there are bits of faux wood and cheap fabric all over my floor.

I realize that it depends on the dog, but I can only speak for my own experience (that's what these are for right?). My dog tore this apart VERY quickly. He's a chewer, and a puppy so he tears through fluffy squeaky toys, but has traditionally loved rope/rubbery toys and not eaten them. This seemed to be an exception. A few minutes after I gave this to him he had managed to swallow the fringe part of the toy. So I cut off the part he didn't chew. Then he chewed the rope right off of the toy and almost swallowed that before I caught him. I really wanted to get some use out of this toy so I took the rope part off and let him play with the blue part. Nope! He chewed it apart and swallowed some of it before I got to him.

Again, maybe your dog will be better with it than mine was. But my little guy is a chewer and this was not a good toy for him. Luckily it went ""right through"" him and I caught the remnants a few days later."

I stopped this food and switched him to lucky dog cuisine homemade food and he almost immediately stopped waking in the night for water. His ears and paws stopped peeling as well.

This food dehydrates your dog. Do not buy and do more research. I can only imagine how dry his internal organs were if his ears and paws were so bad.

They say to feed about 1 can (13.2) ozs. for every 12 lbs. of dogs weight. my 75 lb. Golden Retriever so just over 6 cans about .75 cents/can even at Amazons great price and no shipping it's $4.50/day. I can buy flats of 5 dozen extra large eggs for $2.25/dozen or 19 cents/egg, scramble 6 eggs in a little oil and you've spent $1.20. They say on the label that 1 cup dry kibble is the equivalent to 1.5 cans of this product so I stir 2 cups of hi protein kibble about 70 cents for two cups in to the lightly cooked eggs add table scraps as a garnish. So feed their recommended amount $4.20 or give your dog highly palatable food with necessary vitamins and minerals contained in the kibble for less than $2. As for time it only takes 2 min to soft scramble eggs. My dog trots beside me for my daily 5 mile bike ride. Since I began the new feeding regimen the dog lost excess weight has very good muscle tone and her coat has noticeably improved from dryish to shining probably from the cooking oil and eggs. If your pet has reactions to the wheat or corn in the kibble you might want to eliminate that kibble for the obscenely expensive rice based products or just rely on the table scraps and perhaps some vitamin supplement.

May you and yours be well,"

Cat #1 has NEVER been happy about the addition of cats #2 and #3. Ever since their arrival, MONTHS ago, #1 has been consistently peeing and pooing right beside the box. We tried moving the box, and she simply scooted over to do her stuff. We put this in all the boxes over a week ago. A few minutes after using it, #1 did pee beside the box out of habit, but she hasn't done it again all week! This is incredible. We've gone from cleaning smelly puddles and piles every single day to not at all. Thanks to the Cat Attract, we are a happy family again."

I believe this food actually contributed directly to my dogs death. I wanted a food that would I could switch my dog from Hills Science Diet I/D, and this one seemed to be ideal for my 14 year old Affenpinscher. Unfortunately, the kibble pieces are so small that it is very easy for a dog that ""inhales"" their food, to ingest the pieces into their wind pipe. This is exactly what happened to my dog the first time that I fed it to him. I fed him a small  amount of this kibble mixed with Science Diet I/D, which he had been on for a few months and which he had no problems. Upon the first feeding, my dog began to attempt to cough up a piece of food that been ingested into his windpipe. He was unable to eject the piece of food. Over the next day he continued to attempt to eject the inhaled food from his respiratory system and began to hack and have a very difficult time breathing. I took him to the vet and they indicated that they could not see the piece of food that had lodged in his windpipe with an x-ray but for $1500 to $2000 I could take my dog to the local animal hospital where they had the proper tool to access the respiratory system and remove the piece of food that had lodged there. Since I did not have the money to spend on this procedure, the vet suggested that she try to utilize a balloon type device to pull the obstruction out of the breathing path. As I was desperate to get my dog breathing again I agreed that this may be a feasible solution to the problem. Unfortunately, as soon as the anesthesia was administered, my dog's heart stopped, and he died. I am not saying that this will happen to any other dog but because my dog was an inhaler of his food, I believe that the very small size of this product contributed directly to his death, one day after his fourteenth birthday. I am obviously broken hearted about losing my pet and I would like to warn those that are considering using this product for their  dog that may be an ""inhaler"" as it is so small that it can be easily ingested into the respiratory system and cause problems with the animal being able to breathe."

I have a 60lb Red nosed Pitbull/Labrador mix.  I got him the L/XL sized leash.  He loves to pull as hard as he can.  I got him when he was already almost two, and he's my first dog.  So I was hoping this leash would solve my problems.  But, it didn't.  Yes, it did help a tiny bit.  He is no longer able to pull my arm from its socket when he suddenly takes off after a cat.  But he still PULLS constantly.  He just drops his head and pulls, pulls, pulls.....  I'd say this leash relieved about 10% of the pulling affect.  But that's all.  And, now he doesn't like the leash.  He used to go flipping crazy whenever I grabbed the leash.  Jumping all over me so much I couldn't get him to stay still.  Now he stops moving completely and slowly turns his head away from me.  And this was a dog that two minutes earlier was pestering me to take him for a walk.  So, we're back to using the collar leash and I'm out $16 on this leash."

He has almost destroyed his Kong (heave duty my foot) and I can't find the right treats for his Holee ball. This seemed perfect because I could use the treats we already had and stuff them in the Chuckle toy.
Hemingway would throw the toy all around the house unable to get the treat out. He would then bring it over to me to take it out for him. I love the toy BECAUSE it's hard for him to take out. This is what keeps him busy for longer than 10 minutes. I can see where it would be difficult to clean (a complaint I saw in another review) but I can probably figure out a way to get most of the grime out (either by soaking or using a small thin brush). Otherwise, I'm very happy with the toy. I love watching Hemingway toss the toy around...and the joy of him eating bits and pieces that may fall out. I can be messy this way...but worth it. I will probably get the other variety of Chuckle toys."

1,use two bunny cage also bunny hutch clamp nice tight move ever bunny somewhat small though quite dwarfs drink easily without spill also seem leak even use flip top make fill breeze seal fine well dust anything get water bottle properly shut also add little floating piece see easy distance low water overall enjoy much water bottle try petco petsmart etc,"We use two of these on bunny cages, and now also on a bunny hutch. They clamp down nice and tight and do not move what so ever. Our bunnies - both somewhat small, though not quite dwarfs - can drink from these easily without spilling. They also seem to not leak at all even when not in use.
The flip top makes filling a breeze, and seals just fine as well. No dust or anything gets into the water bottle when it's properly shut. We also added little floating pieces so we can see easier from a distance how low the water is. Overall, we enjoy these much more than most other water bottles we've tried from PetCo, PetSmart etc."

However, my recent shipments have been terribly dry. I sent an email concern and was told it was due to the crop of sweet potatoes. I decided to deal with it and made it through that bag without incident. I then ordered two more bags and, again, they were horribly dried out. This time, my dog nearly died after eating a sweet potato chew that I had cut in half for him, as usual. It got stuck in his throat and he proceeded to vomit and drool profusely atleast 12-15 times. I was on my way to the vet with him when he seemed to be getting better. I decided to lie down next to him for several hours to make sure he was alright. The only good thing is that I was able to return the Big Boyz and was issued a refund. The very bad thing is that I could have lost my dog because the product was so dried out that he was unable to swallow it without it lodging in his throat. This used to be a great product. Please stop selling it when it is overly dried out! It is extremely dangerous to dogs and can be fatal! Thank you."

0,work ok litter box cat instead top half instal cat use ledge hold use box top something realize could use refuse go due poor door design box could good product would recommend anyone without top half cat use leg finish use bathroom throw litter room product major problem without top something sell anymore cat owner,It works as an ok litter box as that is all I have on for my cat instead of the top half being installed. My cat uses the ledge to hold on while he is using the box so the top is something I realized I could not use for him. Not only that but he refused to go in due to a poor door design on the box. It could be a better product so I would not recommend it to anyone. Without the top half on the cat uses his legs when finished using the bathroom and throws the litter all over that room so this product has major problems with and without the top on and it is not something that should be sold anymore to cat owners!

It is supposed to accommodate dogs up to 40lbs or smaller than 18"" measured at the shoulders. If that were the case than this would have been more than enough for our basset hound who measures no more than about 14"" at the shoulders. However, the actual dog flap itself measures no more than 12"" tall and about 8"" wide. How is this expected to allow a dog 18"" AT THE SHOULDERS to fit through at all? This will probably be great for cats, and small dogs, but do yourself a favor and get the ""Large"" size that has a flap ~16"" high and ~10"" wide if your dog is any bigger than a normal sized cat. If you don't, you will be stuck spending an exorbitant amount of money on return shipping (cost me ~$29 through UPS) for who knows why. Maybe it's the awkward dimensions of the box. All I know is I should have got the Large size in the first place and saved myself some money wasted on shipping."

Cora is a 79 lb pitbull who loves all things people and fur but panicked when a dog came at us. While stopped she lunged forward then flipped over, scrambled up and twisted inward under the bar to face backwards. All of this happened in seconds. The leash held fast but swiveling prevented her from getting tangled and hurt. I highly recommend this leash. Cora goes nuts with anticipation the moment I pick up her water bottle, she LOVES running along side me. Thank you for this great product."

I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not-so-bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dog figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!

Unfortunately, this toy is just too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dog's playtime and challenge them further.

However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead."

On the kind that come with a squeaker, the squeaker only lasts a couple of hours, and he has the ball torn apart within a couple of days. A regular tennis ball lasts a couple of days longer, but then they suffer the same fate. He's had these now for about two months and hasn't been able to put a dent in them. The only reason we may need to come back for more is because he loses them under and behind the furniture.

UPDATE 1/11/2014
I bought the original 2-pack of these balls in October 2013. Three months of daily play later, our guy has managed to create a rip in one of the balls, and punctured the other. Please note that this is an endorsement of the quality of the ball, not a complaint. None of the other balls we've gotten him have lasted nearly this long. So I'm back to purchase a couple more."

Unfortunately, it is the worst pet product I have ever purchased. It set up nicely, and everything looked fine, but things fell apart quickly. I ordered this on Nov. 1, 2015 and by mid-December, both the top two platforms had fallen off completely. It started to get wobbly as soon as I set it up. I thought it was a screw issue so I spent a whole bunch of time re-screwing everything in, but by the next day it was loose again. My cats are 13-14 lbs each, and they're never in it at the same time, so it seems that this tree cannot even support a weight of 14lbs. Which is ridiculous. My one cat who loves being up high refused to leave the ""towers"" until it literally just fell off, so he spent the whole time slanted at a 60deg angle. Turns out it's just a matter of poor quality - I looked at the plastic thread part on the columns and the plastic has just completely worn away (yes, that quickly!), creating two HUGE holes that the screws don't fit into. This product is completely worthless unless you have one teeny tiny cat. Or squirrel. I feel robbed, what a complete waste of money."

I looked on Amazon to see others' reviews and I find that I am not alone. I clean the litter box multiple times throughout the day and there is no reason to have this odor in my home.

When the system is working, it does work pretty well with very few problems (changing batteries everyday gets old quick).  Within a months time, I had to send the collar back because of water had gotten into the electronics of the collar and had stopped working. We did have a real wet spring that year and from what I could see the batteries compartment is not sealed from the rest of the electronics in the unit and water and dirt had seeped in thru the battery cap and got all over the electronics. Havahart replaced the collar in a timely manner and said it was a known problem and they were working on it. Great, but this year was different. Another wet Oregon spring brought the same problem again so I again called Havahart (only owned it 11 months at this point) and I was rudely asked if I let my dog swim in it. Duh, no!  Oregon in the spring time...rain, lots of rain. I then asked if they had fixed the problem with the battery compartment. They said they didn't know of any problems. So I figure instead of creating a sealed battery compartment that would completely fix the problem, they seam to be trying to blame the customer for any problems.  They said I had to send the collar back to the company and it would take up to three months to decide if it is their problem or not. I would NOT recommend this product in any kind of wet or dirty environment unless they get their problems fixed with the collar and the service people change their tone."

The positive distinctionof this product to a comparable 3-step stair on the market is basically the comfort and coordination in affords my older dog using this product to get where he needs to go.  The guy can't jump any longer - so these steps not only help but make it less painful  for him to move around.

This fights yeast on dog's skin called Malassezia pachydermatis.  Also fights candida yeast.  Shampoo frequently once a week if you are sure your dog has yeast.
Do not use this as a regular shampoo as it dries out skin too much.

Make sure your dog does not have flea allergies as this will not help.
Make sure your dog does not have demodex mites or sarcoptic mites as this will not help.
Both mites are treatable with meds.  Demodex also requires good nutrition and healthy lifestyle to treat.  Good nutrition in pets means real food - raw meat, cooked and raw veggies, sardines, fish oil, supplements, exercise, happiness, proper bathing and hygiene.

Frequently, my poodle has reddish color inside paws and on face or head.  This is caused either by iron stains from tears or saliva, or malassezia yeast that grows in moisture.  This shampoo is excellent for treating this type of yeast.  Shampoo dog, and keep massaging those areas for 10 mins before rinse and conditioner.  Repeat weekly and fix the diet.  Shave off the feet if too much hair is inside the paws, this helps a lot."

The piece is long, 22 inches but at its thickest its only 4 inches in diameter, and there are 3 skippy pieces sticking out all less than 4 inches. The worst part however was the actually quality of the wood, as you see in the picture is has horrible discoloration that seems to be from mold and mildew growth. I wouldn't trust it to have in my enclosure buy any means. I've owned reptiles for a while and used grapevine many times. The difference is, I have always bought in person. This the worst example of grapevine I have seen and I recommend trying another source or only buying in person."

The other one used it every now and then...she acted as if she had a problem with it, perhaps it made her feel odd.

But the problem I have with this system is that it increases the amount of air that gets into a dog's system at mealtime.  We strive to eliminate the ingestion of air to the extent possible...it's a factor in bloat...and this obviously counteracts any other efforts to that end.  My dogs burp and burp after using this (it's not just the ingredients in the liquid causing distress...they can have that off my finger and be just fine)...and sometimes the burps will bring along the contents of the stomach.

It took me a while to figure out what was going on....but it was real easy to test.  Yep....licking the paddle causes the ingestion of air.

If you inadvertently stepped on one they crush and make an even bigger mess! To avoid the smell I had to replace crystal box every few days to a week and that can get pricy at ~$20/3pk. In the box itself, there weren't many crystals at all and often my kitty would be digging wide empty areas with no crystals because the layer was so thin (which I think contributed to the ammonia smell). It's also awkward to throw away - throwing away this big box every week. The rakes also clump with kitty poo - requiring a good manual clean every so often.

Otherwise, my tabby wasn't the least bit scared to use it and would happily go within a day. I don't see timid cats (like Persians) adjusting to this very well but I'm sure your results will vary. In every other way it worked as expected. I personally prefer something that works with regular litter but I'm sure that this works well for some people - just not me."

At the breeder's recommendation, we put the original steel crate in a central location in our house, and bought this lightweight crate to use temporarily in our bedroom. She loves the crate and it has been a dream to use and maintain. It is also easy to secure in the back seat of the car, so she is ready for long-distance travel in safety and security. My husband says it was a great investment and we are all very satisfied.

I look forward to using this crate for overnight trips, since it will allow the dog to feel safe in unfamiliar surroundings such as hotel rooms. Some hotels require a crate, and this is a wonderful collapsible, lightweight option. (Being able to keep one or more zippered flaps rolled up and open is a real bonus.)

I will mention that the first night our dog was gnawing on the interior of the crate but (fortunately) she quickly lost interest. If she had been more persistent, she could have done some damage. We now put a couple of chew toys in with her at night, so they keep her focus away from any activity that would damage the crate."

0,call kitty convict collar adjust average sized cat plastic adjustment tab cover part embroidery lucky cat small area need area code plastic tab cover name unlucky like quite others cover phone number 6th 8th digit even large cat nt much neck large small cat fifteen vs eight lb number would still cut mean cat get someone would catch check collar call open stranger guarantee would nt let someone grab pay shipping back bad design get money back disappointing,"It's called a Kitty Convict collar, but when adjusted for average sized cats the plastic adjustment tab covers part of the embroidery. If you're lucky your cat will be so small or you'll be in an area not needing an area code so that the plastic tab only covers the name. If you're unlucky (like me and quite a few others) it covers the phone number on the 6th and 8th digit. And even my largest cat didn't have much of a neck larger than my smallest cat (15 vs 8 lbs) so the number would still be cut off.

This means if my cat got out, someone would have to catch her and check the collar before calling me. She's not the most open to strangers so I can guarantee you she wouldn't let someone grab her. So now I have to pay shipping back for their bad design to get some of the money back. It's disappointing."

1,second one partially due mistake nt realize clear bottle dishwasher safe long time would always hand wash one lazy day decide let dishwasher work bad idea whole thing melt warp great product nt mind hand wash recommend everyone know multiple dog even single large dog worrying remember fill water bowl day fill every three day issue product gimmicky charcoal filter fyi count much water take use sink water without extra filter filter severely restrict flow water leave little charcoal dust particle water good feature otherwise good product,"I am on my second one but that is partially due to my own mistake. I didn't realize that the clear bottle is not dishwasher safe. For a very long time I would always just hand wash, but one lazy day I decided to just let the dishwasher do all the work. Bad idea. The whole thing melted and warped. It is a great product if you don't mind the hand washing.

I recommend this to everyone I know who has multiple dogs or even a single large dog. No more worrying about remembering to fill up the water bowl each day. I fill it up about every three days.

The only issue I have with the product is the gimmicky charcoal filter. FYI - do not count on this doing much for the water. I take it out and just use sink water without the extra filter. The filter severely restricts the flow of the water and it leaves little charcoal dust particles in the water. Not a good feature on an otherwise good product."

I am simply in love with it! I haven't ever used a retractable dog leash before, but now I would never go back after trying this one. My dog likes to jump and bite at the leash when I take him out to go to the bathroom and for walks. However, now he can no longer do that because when he reaches to bite at this leash, it retracts in and keeps it straight so he has nothing to bite at. Also, I love the length, especially in this frigid weather we are having. I can open the door, let my dog out, and then close the door to just a crack and he can run up to 16 feet away to use the bathroom. That way I don't have to be freezing outside while waiting on him to use the bathroom. The quality seems like it will last for years and years and is heavy duty so I know it is made for my big dog that is about 80 lbs. I also love the grip handle so that it won't slip out of your hand. Finally, the buttons to lock and unlock the leash from extending or retracting are in a perfect spot and easy to use. Overall I would rate this 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend this to anyone with a dog!"

This product is a perfect example of how a company cuts corners to the point that the product really doesn't work anymore. The instruction sheet is designed for two different products, one on each side. Great, they saved money on printing. Then, there's no real instructions, just some pictures that don't really show how the joints work. Then, there's the joint couplers themselves. They're a joke. Rather than designing custom joint couplers that work really well for this particular frame, they went with some crappy, one-size-fits-all aluminum couplers that aren't designed to handle the intricate stresses of this framework. YOU HAVE to provide your own screws and drill these poles so they won't twist and fall out of the couplers. It doesn't matter how tight you tighten the coupler screws. The poles will still twist. The tightening screws on the short poles, which should be used to adjust your width a little, if your kennel is a little off on specs, are fused. They're just there for looks. I ordered this in the early spring and missed my return window for returning it, not to mention the cheap ass box ripped apart anyway. I will never order a ""LUCKY DOG"" product again. I am completely unimpressed with this company and their willingness to short change their customers to make a buck."
0,purchase two cage five year ago bring conure home one parrot size one cockatiel size sleep two good quality price especially since spend lot time cage need another cage travel thinking would get quality order one overall construction seem solid previous penn plax cage dish small seemingly way small cockatiel definitely small green cheek conure slightly small tiel way food door position bottom side make difficult place toy perch nt accidentally poop dish opt use stainless steel dish holder position towards top cage wood perch fit loosely replace rope perch sand perch nt even fit cage front door old cage latch hook securely lock door way new one work cage door snap cage seem like loosen time plus paint scratch right away food door lock one old cage good escape artist bird since use permanently secure somehow since cage use regularly keep make would recommend cage primary cage bird invest something sturdier safe thoughtfully design may serve well sleep cage,"We had purchased 2 of these cages 5 years ago when we brought our conure home...one parrot sized and one cockatiel sized that she sleeps in.  Those 2 were very good quality for the price, especially since she spends a lot of time out of the cage.  We needed another cage for travel so thinking I would get the same quality, I ordered this one.  Not the same at all!

- The overall construction does not seem as solid as the previous Penn Plax cages we have.
- the dishes are small, seemingly way too small for a cockatiel, definitely too small for my Green Cheek conure who is slightly smaller than a Tiel.
- the way the food doors are positioned on the bottom side, it makes it difficult to place her toys and perches so she doesn't accidentally poop in her dish.  We are opting to use stainless steel dishes and holders that we will position towards the top of the cage.
- wood perches fit loosely...I have replaced them with rope perches.
- the sand perches don't even fit in the cage.
- the front door on my older cages have a latch and hook to securely lock the door.  The way this new one works, where the cage door snaps into the cage, seems like it will loosen over time.  Plus the paint scratches off right away.
- The food doors do not lock as the ones on my older cage do.  This will not be good for any escape artist birds.  Since we will not use them, we will permanently secure them somehow.

Since this is a cage we are not using regularly, I am keeping and making do.  I would NOT recommend this cage as a primary cage for your bird - invest in something sturdier, safer and more thoughtfully designed.  It may serve well as a sleep cage."

It didn't last two weeks before it broke beyond repair. The motor simply couldn't move the litter clumps into the bucket. This litterbox is continous, meaning that it cleans and moves every minute in very small amounts that hopefully go unnoticed by your cat (although mine did not like the click of the box rotating every minute, so he barely even used it). It would be a smart design, if it had more power and better parts, but it doesn't and not even my husband (an engineer) could repair it once it stopped working.

Within weeks she died in her sleep.  Obviously I do not know for sure if this brand contributed to this or it was a coincidence.  All I know it is hard not to believe it with everything on the news lately about treats killing our dogs that are from or contain Chinese ingredients.  Recently Petco and Petsmart announced they will not sell any chinese treats anymore.  If you care for your pet pay more to get USA made and US ingredients or just don't give them any.

Update:  I wrote an email to pet naturals and specifically asked where the treats are made and what countries there ingredients originate from.  There answer was their treats are manufactured in the US but the ingredients are from around the world.  They would not specifically list which countries they are from.  They did acknowledge though that the majority of the ingredients come from China.  Also they stressed that safety of the ingredients are used, but what company doesn't claim this.

We bought this for our new boy cat, but our smaller female tabby who has an older carrier LOVES sitting in this one.  I plan on, buying another Sherpa for her.  Cat approved :)"

1,teeter four five star review ca nt say love product fine definitely love company use far really trick cat durable comfortable add padding secure picky reason felt little unhappy product totally zip open one end time understand carrier great storage unzip completely go flat first little concerned could nt open front back time like leave carrier sometimes cat play run ca nt regardless people pet magasin topnotch customer service mean everything happy purchase small business always recommend future,"I teetered between a four and five star review. I can't say I ""love"" the product (its just fine) but I definitely love the company. I've only used it once so far and it really did the trick for my cats: durable, comfortable (with added padding), and secure. If I'm being picky, the only reason why I felt a little unhappy with the product is because once its totally zipped up you can only open one end at a time. I understand that this carrier is great for storage as it unzips completely and goes flat, but at first I was a little concerned that I couldn't have open both the front and back at the same time- I like to leave the carriers out sometimes for the cats to play in and run through and they can't with these. Regardless of this, the people at Pet Magasin have top-notch customer service and that means everything to me. I am very happy about my purchase with this small business and will always recommend them in the future."

I was very surprised at the quality of the foam - it's firm, yet supportive. It doesn't sink to the floor when I step or sit on it (I weigh 140 lbs). This bed is actually of much better quality than my dog's regular ortho bed from Chewy that cost 3x as much. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bed I received was grey and not green as pictured. The cover also does not seem to be that great of quality, and I don't see it holding up well wash after wash.  My dog is a18 lb mini poodle with long legs and is about 24 inches long from her head to the base of her tail. She fit perfectly."

I stick a Get Naked chew stick all the way thru and throw it on my way out, or when I need 10 minutes of puppy peace.  I love that it's rugged enough to still look brand new, but soft enough that it bounces and it apparently is more pleasant to chew.  Please don't discontinue!!!"

I have a 20 lb. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with very thick nails that twist and curl as they grow, which makes clipping them pretty tricky. I've been trimming my dog's nails since he was 14 weeks old, so Im familiar with do fife rent styles of clippers. I purchased the clipper for large dogs because in my experience, clippers for smaller pets don't work on his hard, thick nails. These clippers are cumbersome and the head is very thick, making it hard to see. If not for the guide I wouldn't have even tried them. I clipped my dog's nails shortly after his bath so that they would be less brittle. Even having taken this extra step I felt the nail trimmer required excessive grip and pressure, making it even harder to do an already difficult job.  While they did work,  the cuts weren't fast or smooth and nail clippings flew everywhere, confirming that lot of pressure was needed to cut his nails. They are well made and feel substantial in your hand, but I'm returning these because I won't risk using them again."

This thing is huge (bigger than a golf ball, smaller than a tennis ball) and was pretty dry on delivery. It's rough on the exterior, too and must not have had much of a catnip smell because she was absolutely not interested. I have some pouches of cheap fabric filled with a tiny bit of catnip that she's been rolling and drooling on for many years that she prefers way more than this thing. The Pawbreakers catnip ball is much better, in my opinion, as well as my cat's opinion."

He has destroyed two beds already and any toy we give him (besides the kong extreme ball) looses all its stuffing within minutes. After hours of searching I decided to give this bed a try because it was way cheaper than most (huge plus if he was just going to tear it apart) and because it was more flat than others while still looking soft and comfortable. So far we have had this bed three times longer than any other one of his beds and he has not even tried to chew it. He LOVES laying down and resting his head on the raised edge. He loves it so much he brings all his toys (the indestructible ball, a rope, and the shells of his other stuffed toys) to his bed whenever he is done playing with them. It's thin enough I can actually stick the whole thing into the wash and I am just so happy he doesn't want to kill this bed I would give it ten stars if I could."

It's very light weight so when it is empty the pressure from even slowly turning the water hose on would turn it over. If it did not turn it over it would twist the float valve sideways or upside rendering it useless. The valve and hose attachments are all cheap/soft plastics, so you can't tighten it up enough to hold it snug. And on top of all that every two or three days we had to disassemble the entire thing to clean the green slime out of it. Not sure if the more expensive stainless steel ones are any better. But I would not waste money on this one, at least not if you're planning to hook it to a water hose outside."

No tummy troubles on it, healthy and strong, growing beautifully. But I had a disappointing experience with the Amazon order.

I ordered the giant 26-lb bag, as my labrador puppy finishes a 12-lb bag in under 2 weeks. I was very dismayed to receive a bag of food - well over a month's supply for my 34-lb puppy, a more for a smaller dog! - that expires in two weeks. This is an excellent dog food, but I'm not going to feed expired product to my puppy. That's the danger of ordering food online, I suppose. While it's cheaper and certainly more convenient, I won't be ordering it again. (Amazon was great about the refund, however, excellent customer service.)"

On the other 3 they were thick, plush, well made, and stand a lot of washing before degradation. This one is nearly the same visibly and is plush but I would say has about 30% less filler and is less robust. The price is about the same. Looks like I'll have to buy the more expensive products to get quality. The others lasted about 18 months. I doubt this will make 6."

I bought these specifically for the snow months in NJ.  My dog wore them until the thread started to come undone.  If I had to estimate, he probably got a good 8K miles out of these.  He wore them during the hot summer months too because the asphalt was so hot.  The sole is so tough and rugged it feels like a tire.  He wore them in the snow, mud, trails and even inside the house so he didn't slip all over place when we had company.  These work wonders.  Not to mention they look so cute on any dog.  We got the red pair because they didn't have the blue.  But, the one thing I do suggest is measure your dog's paw as close as you can to the measuring chart.  Also, add a little room if you dog has longer than normal nails.  Because you don't want his/her nails to be so long that it causes their toes to be pushed back.  This is what I considered when measuring.  We're now in Florida so we don't use it as much only during the summer when it's so hot on the ground.  I would definitely recommend these to all furbabies for their durability, texture, and long lasting."

The liver treats are not chopped into pieces so either you do that with your hands or with a blender/food processor.  Either way who wants to do that?  Plus a blender will chop them too small.  It's kind of like buying a car and thinking you saved money on it only to realize it's not painted and you've to spend the money and time to paint it yourself.

Plus, the smoked flavor must be something my dog doesn't agree with, because he has puked twice after eating these."

I have a guinea pig and a chinchilla. Both have definitely enjoyed it a lot (separately, of course). They like being able to see out of the large screen panels, and it's just the right amount of space for them. I am concerned about how long it will last before an escape hole is chewed into it by either or both. I can see evidence of chewing on the edges of the mesh after only using it a few times.

CON: Be aware that there is NO included carrying case, as the product information states. All there is for securing the play pen is an elastic strap that goes around it after it's folded flat. One of the main reasons I chose this one over other similar items was the (not included) carrying case. Not pleased by this."

The only reason this is getting four stars instead of five is the clasps that Clasp the top of the box to the bottom.

 As someone with limited mobility in my hands, the top was almost impossible to clasp with the clasps on the box, which made the first time I used the box a disaster as I didn't get them tight enough and litter went everywhere.

After purchasing some alligator clips and being sure that the top was going to stay on the box, I've been extremely happy with the product.

 It's much easier to use than using a scoop with my hands the way they are.

Omega work on an easier clasp system and you get a 5 from me."

The first downside I noticed was when the cat used it he tended to try more for the edge of the litter.  Of course this means that it leaked between the disk and the holder.  Puppy pads helped with keeping the floor a little cleaner.  We cleaned it after each use and repositioned him every time we caught him going.  After about two weeks he quit going on the side of the disk so we moved it up to the toilet.  He started going on the side of the disk again and sometimes on the holder itself.  What a pain to clean.  We stuck with it for two and a half weeks before he had it and we switched to the orange disk.  He started going in the tub, in the sink, and on the floor.  We tried putting him on the Litter Qwitter and showing him where it was and that there was still litter but he just refused to use it with the orange disk.  After a week we went back to red and he again started peeing on the edge.  Another two weeks and we switched to orange again.  He switched back to the tub, sink, and floor.  We tried to get him to use it by having a stool next to the toilet for him to have some extra room to get up to the toilet, showed him the litter in the morning, before we went to work, and when we got home.  We picked him up out of the tub and sink when we caught him and put him on the toilet.  We moved his business from the tub and sink to the litter when we didn't and let him see it in the toilet.  He still wouldn't use the orange disk after another two weeks and we were so tired of cleaning up the mess that we just went back to a regular litter box."

She actually jumps up on the counter to be ""saddled up"" when I take it out. So ... great product, easy to put on and take off. That said, people unaccustomed to walking cats should understand that it isn't like walking a dog. You don't walk cats; they walk you. The harness and leash primarily are a means of restraining a cat in the event of sudden impulses and only secondarily a means of suggesting direction (most of which suggestions the cat will ignore). Some of our walks are far-ranging, others are spent in one place smelling a leaf. I bring a book with me."

(I eliminated and medical reason or bathroom needs that may have explained this.  Apparently its a common spurt of rebellion for dogs in their teenage stage.) The best way to deal with this is to let them cry or bark it out for a few nights (just like initial crate training) so they know acting up doesnt get them what they want. However I have shared walls with my neighbors and doubted they have the same ability to block him out as I do. So eventually it would get to a point where I would have to get up and let him out before he woke them up too. Which of course reinforced the behavior.

This device has worked up to a point. Hes very intelligent so he figured out exactly how loud he can be before it set off the device. So while hes not completely silent like he used to be, its at least toned him down to a point where I don't think my neighbors hear him, and thus I can ignore him without having anxiety over bothering anyone.

I do like the ability to activate it using the button on top and am also using it when I hear him trying to flip open the trash can lid in the kitchen. As soon as he hears the tone he comes back into the living room and lays down. My only complaint about the design is the lack of an on/ off switch.  You can only turn it off by removing the battery."

If theres no weight on it, it won't power on so thats an awesome perk. Having that auto shut off feature for it when the cats aren't lying on it prolongs the life of it and also prevents a fire from happening. I wouldnt recommend using this outdoors. Its definitely and indoor item and should be kept away from weather elements. I plan to buy two more since I have 3 kitties!"

It's a pretty good fit, but not 100% There's mosquitoes where our dog lives, lots of them.  I still have a blanket covering the doorway as an additional barrier to keep them out.

*I wish the packaging had explained those wrapper thingies. They aren't paper or cellophane - not sure what they are. Are they supposed to be consumed by the cat, perhaps delivering some dental benefit? Or do they just keep the rather crumbly treats from disintegration during shipping?

In practice, I did wonder, though in the end it did not matter because like I said, my cat didn't like these treats no matter how I presented them"

I usually have to buy a new pair every year because they only last for 2 hair cuts on him. I had barrowed a professional set from my mother-in-law that she used on her show chows. They didn't even cut it (pun intended) on my dog. These where within my price range for that years purchase so I got them. I never expected to be able to still use them 6 years later. I would shave him in the spring, summer, and occasionally in the fall if it was still really warm out. We also use them on my husband, son, and 4 brothers hair. As long as you keep them clean and well oiled they should last a long time.
The only down side is that the blades do get rather hot (hence the 4 star). Since there the only pair that seems to get the job done, over and over, I'm willing to over look that."

They are made to last for a while. the construction is usually high. The multiple stitchings definitely help our dogs in playing hours of tug. Although these toys felt nice to the human hands--soft fabrics, their playability quotient was extremely low. We had another tuffy snake prior to these two snakes. It was a different design. Rather than a curved design, it was straight back to front. The material used was the typical tuffy rough fabrick. Our dogs constantly played with it for several months before the stuffing was removed. This item, not so much. Within two weeks of purchasing these and opening them, our dogs managed to remove the stuffing. We have not had that happen with any of the other tuffy toys we have owned including the rings, bull, TRex, sea creatures, etc. I will not be purchasing any more of these snakes.

What a great design!  The wire bristles stay straight and the push button makes it easy to remove the hair.  My 3 short hair cats 'demand' I brush them with this brush.  They love it.  If I start brushing one cat and the other 2 cats hear it, they come running and beg to be brushed.  Regarding hair removal from the brush, push the button many times until the cat hair finally gives up and falls into the wastebasket.  The button is easy to push.
SUGGESTION TO THE MANUFACTURER:
Build a case that protects the bristles from getting bent when traveling.  My brushes have never travelled but I can see where this could be an issue.
UPDATE: One year later.  This brush is great!  The wire bristles stay straight due to its excellent self cleaning design.  I'm buying a third brush today.  Not because the other two are worn out but because I want these conveniently placed in multiple rooms of the house.
This brush is great!  If your cats like a wire brush like my 3 cats do, then buy this brush.  When I ask my cats if they want a brushin' then show them my brush they come running for it!  When you push the button on the back it will temporarily hide the bristles making it super easy to remove the hair without damaging the bristles. As a result the bristles stay perfectly straight.  I don't know if using this brush daily will reduce flea issues but my cats have no fleas.
Some reviewers complain their cats hate wire brushes.  In some cases I wonder if the owners are pressing too hard when they brush their cats.  The bonier the cat the lighter you should brush with this thing.  Seems like common sense but some people lack it."

I emailed the company, and they never got back to me, unless their reply ended up in my spam bin.  (I always read email on my phone and don't have a spam box enabled.)  With that said, everyone else seems to like them.  So either I put them on incorrectly or my Houdini dog just won't keep them on!"

The instructions say these need to be replaced every two weeks...  i say they need it every week.  They do not keep the water in the fountain fresh at all.  I have to change it every 5-7 days as it gets murky and slimy.  I put filtered water in to begin with!!!  Am trying to make the filters last the two weeks, so i wash them out with every water replacement.  This NEVER happened with my Pioneer Pet Fountain.  Am very disappointed."

My cats were scratching up the doors and door frames in my house and they stopped after I applied Sticky Paws. They go to scratch the wood and get discouraged when their paws stick to the surface (kind of amusing to watch, actually.) However my cat's fur started sticking to the strips of tape (black fur, mind you so it looked terrible) and then they went back to scratching the wood through the now non-sticky, useless tape.  I just got through an hour of scrubbing and scraping using ""Goo Gone"" and a palette knife to remove the product from just one door and door frame which inspired me to write this review.

I don't know what the solution is to this problem -- leave out more scratching posts(?), leave doors open(?), tack up a sheet of vinyl that can be easily removed and replaced as it get worn down(?) -- but what I do know, is you should steer clear of this product."

While I understand that this is a issue based upon what the individual cat is comfortable with doing, the overall design of the door is flawed.  While one of the two cats that would not use the door, was trying the door out and pushing it with his paw to get comfortable with it, the door closed on his paw catching it like a trap.  As he tried to pull away, the door simply became tighter and clamped down.  He then of course flipped out and ""screamed"" (never have I heard a cat make that sound before) panicking until I was able to get to him and push the door the opposite way to free him.  Luckily I was close at hand so he didn't suffer an injury.  I have already ripped the flaps off the doors to prevent this from happening in the future, so basically I have wasted my money.

I have had it for a couple months now and other than one cat being knocked off by another, not a single issue! It seems as i it's designed to replace in a corner, which is exactly where I put it. The upper platforms were little wobbly so all you have to do is screw it and mounted into the wall and you won't ever have to worry about it falling over or having too much weight placed on it. Have 3 cats, 7 lbs, 13 lbs and 18 lbs. Not an issue at all with them and this tower.
Most of all, your paying almost a third of the price of high quality cat towers. You get what you pay for a, but with this you get a lot more than you pay for. You just have to be willing to do a little bit of extra work to put it together right."

Here is what I liked, the hay is cut in 3 to 4 inch strips that was the only plus. The negatives far out numbered the plus's, I bought 3 of these tubes assuming the tubes were stuffed with hay and marigolds which is not the case they are placed in the tubes like a box of cereal as soon as you open the clear wrap around the tubes it all falls right out so there is no foraging for any critter, there was only 1 marigold head in the entire tube not even any petals. All 3 had holes in the plastic wrap because of the way they were wrapped at the factory so the box they came in was full of chaff and on the verge over being way to dry because of the air and it not being packed tight in the tube like the bags are packed the air can easily dry the hay way too fast and in each tube there was plenty of chaff dust way too much. Out of curiosity I opened the other 2 tubes  and found only 4 more marigold heads and also no petals. Each tube filled a one gallon zip lock bag which will at least slow down the drying of the hay. The only reason I kept them was for the tubes that they came in you can't buy a nice tube of this size for a chinchilla to play in for the ""add on"" price of $2.35. If you are buying this for the marigolds as I was you too will be very disappointed like me.  Just buy the Kaytee Timothy hay with Marigolds for a few dollars more if you want marigolds with your hay unless you want the tubes which are big enough for a chinchilla to play with."

I have two pups under the age of  1yr that can tend to get very wiley. Being able to train them individually with one device was really great. The handset allows you to easily switch between collar number one and two quickly and easily. You can also switch between shock, vibration, and a beep very fast. I found personally that neither dog ever needed anything more than the vibration collars. The vibration instantly interrupted their train of thought when they were misbehaving. One of my dogs was a rescue and nervous after having been abused so I was definitely concerned and did not want to use a shock collar on her and wondered if a vibration collar would work. She had aggressive barking tendencies towards men, and would go into what many people call a red state of being out of control. The vibration was enough to break her of those bad habits. Yet it was gentle enough that it never frightened her. Keeping the vibration at a medium level of 50 and moving it up 10 to 15 points at a time to a maximum of 100 if she was continuing in an aggressive behavior quickly stopped her actions. Even now if they begin to forget their manners putting their collars on with simply the small weight of the electronic feature and them seeing me bring out the remote, just like small children, their manners seem to immediately get better LOL"

I tried using normal dog food like the photo shows (or what I interpreted it as being) and the food got jammed and I had to keep helping my dog. The other frustration is that the food can move backwards in the ball which may be nice if you're trying to really keep your dog occupied, but I felt like she was never getting rewarded for her efforts. Finally, if your dog is a strong chewer, this ball is small enough to fit in their mouth and pretty easy to destroy."

I found the perfect pink and red betta, and Santa supplied her with everything he would need, including this tank. She named her fish Frank and was the perfect mom, never letting food stay in the tank, using test strips to check his water conditions......not that we needed to do that much considering he only lived 10 happy days, making bubble nests, before the tank killed him. A few people mentioned that their fish got ""sucked up by the filter"". That's not quite what happens though. The filter intake is covered and could not suck a fish up, so I didn't understand the reviews at first. However....

Take a look at the ""Product Description"" and note the photo of the tank with filter installed and the hood off. See that open area on top of the filter, where the white filter pad lies? That surface sits about 1/2 inch above the water surface....maybe less. Note: fish jump occasionally. It takes next to nothing for a fish to lift a bit out of the water in this tank and end up stranded up on the filter pad with no water. That's what happened to our Frank when we were out one day. To add insult to injury, he obviously tried to flop back towards the water, but instead kept hitting the light bulb of the hood which is exposed right over the filter pad and is very hot. The smell was not good. And the situation of that bulb makes it impossible to block a fish from jumping up there with mesh or sponge. Anything wedged in there would probably burn on the light.

The only reason I gave this two stars, instead of hating it completely, is that one COULD choose to use the tank without the filter in order to avoid death by suffocation and cooking. Just keep your eye on the water quality."

1,purchase one sheet green mare little leery color fit since seventy-four size sale price high teen go seventy-two mare measure seventy-four narrow blanket size often big anyway get sheet heavy expect fit perfectly color amazing look really great highend look keep get comment fancy one thing would clarify canvas sheet yes canvas cotton bit different one generally think word cotton use worry hot seem fine horse current temperature fifty night pipe corral also seem waterproof nt mention product page bonus importantly mare seem really like comfortable stay put beautifully never even crook go morning lie issue seem enjoy crinkly nylon sheet also love shoulder gusset allow freer movement stable sheet nt reason horse nt move around stall anyone want read benefit waterproof made canvas ha shoulder gusset adjustable fit stay put high quality look feel look fantastic frankly wish buy two probably buy identical one winter,"I purchased one of these sheets in green for my mare and was a little leery of both the color and the fit, since the 74"" size was on sale for a price in the high teens and I went with it over the 72"".  My mare measures as 74"" but is so narrow that blankets that size are often big on her.  Anyway, I got the sheet and it is not only heavier than I expected but fits her perfectly.  The color is amazing and looks really great on her.  It has a very high-end look to it; I keep getting comments on how ""fancy"" it is.

The one thing I would clarify is that this is a canvas sheet.  Yes, canvas is cotton, but it's a bit different from what one generally thinks of when the word ""cotton"" is used.  I was worried about it being too hot but it seems to be fine for my horse in our current temperatures (50s at night and she is in a pipe corral).  It also seems to have been waterproofed, which wasn't mentioned on the product page but is a bonus.

Most importantly, my mare seems to really like it and be comfortable in it.  It stays put beautifully; it's never even crooked when I go out in the mornings.  She lies down in it with no issues and just seems to enjoy having it on more than the crinkly nylon sheets.  I also love that it has shoulder gussets to allow freer movement.  Most stable sheets don't have them for some reason, as if horses don't move around in their stalls.

So for anyone not wanting to read all of that...

BENEFITS:

-Waterproofed
-Made of canvas
-Has shoulder gussets
-Very adjustable fit
-Stays put
-High quality look and feel
-Looks fantastic

Frankly I wish I had bought two of them, and probably will buy an identical one before the winter is over."

I used it for about 2 months, when I could no longer stand it anymore!  The first ""floor"" they used the corner as their toilet.  They peed and pooped there.  Much of it ran down both the inside/outside of the tank.  So I had to put a paper towel under the bottom outside corner of the tank to catch the pee spills and poo drops.  There was a strong odor of rodent pee in the house because of this!

They then decided to make a sleeping nest on the top ""floor.""  They love to shred their bedding, and so bedding came out all over the place around the outside of the tank, making the floor a complete mess.

It was very hard to keep clean.  I had to detach the top frequently, take it outside and hose it down and then scrub the hardened pee/poo/hair mess in the corner of the shelves off with a wire brush.  The shelves pop off the walls and are a pain to get back on.  The ramps also come off very easily.

Two stars.  Great concept, gross result!

I purchased a used 30 gallon reptile tank with screen top on craigslist, where the pee, poo and bedding is well contained.  The girls can burrow and climb on their toys to their hearts content.  Much, much better!  Don't recommend this topper."

The House was smash, wood was broke in a few places as well. I ordered a replacement, just got it today.
Box was worse then the frist one, this house inside looked like it was put together & took apart a few times & the wood was broke & split in mutli places. I called & going to try a second replacement, we'll see how that goes.

UPDATE:  I got the thrid one, Box was held together w/ only 1 roll of tape.
The hinges that hold the top on were ripped out & the wood was in 3 pieces.
A few large dents & cracks on a few parts, 3 of 3 all trash.

This dog house is very cheap the walls are bearly 1/4 in. The flooring is the same, For an X-large house a +60 LB. dog might break through the floor, The roof is thin as well, a mid-large dog might break though it if jumping on it.
People that gave this 5 stars must be using it inside the home or small dogs.
Needless to say I wouldn't get one of these."

When I opened it up, I first noted how strong and durable it was. The stitching is strong and the harness itself is very well padded. I felt that if my dogs were to pull at all, they would be comfortable and not placed in any distress. The adjustment strap that goes under the bellly is adjustable and fit all three of my dogs comfortably. The latch has a red circle that you press up or down to release or lock the latch in place. This made me more relaxed knowing that it would be difficult for my dog to break free but yet comfortable for them as well.
Your personal leash for your dog attaches on the back of the harness. It is also strong and durable. The is a handle also in which you can grab your dog with in case you need your pet close to you and unable to run.
All three of my dogs became very comfortable with the harness in less than 2 days. They were taking turns being walked with it and had no problems at all. When finished walking, we were also able to take the harness off very easily. This is another positive. I feel this harness is everything it is meant to be and more.
I did receive the harness at a discount in return for an honest and true review of it. All thoughts and opinions are my own. I am extremely pleased with this harness and thinking of buying two more for my other dogs. I would recommend this harness to anyone who has trouble walking their dog with the everyday leash and wants to protect their dog from injury and yourself from dog pulling."

Even when properly diluted, this stuff has an extremely strong scent that lingers for a long time. I have been trying to air out the odor for over 24 hours, to no avail. Now I'm looking for two new products - one that will actually get rid of the cat urine, and one to get rid of the awful Thornell smell that is now permeating my home.

Edited to add: It's now been a week since I used this product. The smell has lessened, but has not gone away. My house still stinks like musty ginger. I have tried multiple times to clean my carpet where I used the Thornells, and nothing has taken the disgusting ginger smell out - vinegar, baking soda, commercial deodorizing products, not even cleaning with a carpet shampooer! I get headaches daily from the lingering fumes.

If you buy this product, I hope you love the smell...because it's never going away!"

Beyond that, it's totally USELESS!!

It was clearly designed by someone who has never scooped anything, let alone a litter box!!!

First, it's FLAT!! Ever try balancing a ping pong ball on the paddle? Then you'll see the problem here. Try keeping rounded clumps and other rounded shapes (#2's) on a flat scoop!  A normal scoop secures the clump in a curved bottom.  This genious missed class when it came to the concept of how a spoon works!!

Second, much like the first,the handle is also FLAT!!!  There's no curve! Without the curve, your wrist has to do all the contorting to keep the scoop level to keep the clump from rolling off!  It's actually painful if you're over 50 and have more than one box to scoop like I do!  Try putting the scoop into the litter box at a normal downward angle but then lifting out the entire scoop in a perfectly horizotally FLAT position!  It gets even more difficult with less than large boxes because you can't get it level without hitting the scoop or your wrist on the sides of the box!

Third, the really complicated part the desinger also skipped class--this scoop has virtually no side edges!! I'm sure I don't have to explain the problem with that.

If they had add the improved sieve design onto a ""normal"" scoop, they would've brought a better than average scoop to the market--it would've been a great scoop. But, whoever designed this one clearly thought they were so clever they could design-out ALL the features that makes a scoop work!  What a genious!

Don't buy this scoop!  Get one that works!!"

Seems like a good idea for stores but online I received  a bag, inside a box, inside a larger box. A waste of alot of packaging. That aside, the food is great. Has great benefits for large breed dog joints and added vitamins. I love  that  it has no added colors or preseratives. Our dogs are like family and we like a more natural option for their dog food. They really seem to like the food too. No upset bellies from the change, but we did transition it in with a mix of their current  brand food.

I had always bought the 30 lb bag. This time I bought the 15 lb bag.

The food now has a very distinct smell that I never noticed before. My dog will no longer eat it - unless I don't give him any other food and he's too hungry. Finally, after a few weeks, he got really sick and wouldn't eat the food at all. I started feeding him different food. He got better after a couple of  weeks. When I put him on the TOTW again, he got sick AGAIN! Vomiting, lethargic and low energy (I have a Jack Russell terrier who is always very energetic).

I then started reading the reviews online and noticed that there were a number of similar complaints, most very recent.

Either something changed in quality or the 15 lb bags are produced differently or at a different location."

They arrived on time and looked as expected. We keep them as dog house liners outside in Seattle, so they see a lot of rain/mud/leaves. We don't machine wash them, they have loops at one end so we hang them outside and spray and hose them down to wash them off. They take a few hours to dry on a sunny day, which is a rare thing in Seattle, so we often hang them in the basement instead so they can be placed back for bed time at night.

Its been a year now and the middle section is getting thin. I'm looking back now to see if I'll reorder or buy something different. The outside edge is still padded (they are more snuggly padded on the outside from day 1 anyway), but the middle is pretty much done.

For the price and 12 months of use, with regular hosing down, I've been happy with these beds. But I might try something else to see if the padding holds up."

I've gotten their GoDog dinosaurs (both pink and blue) and they have this like kevlar lining and are indestructible (with the exception of the small tag).

This guy, not so much, his head is filled with stuffing and within an hour was destroyed. The rest of the body appears to be made of a stronger material, so it's now like a flat Stanley that the pup drags around the house and plays with.

I was expecting something much more durable and long lasting for my dedicated chewer, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a chew resistant toy and I wouldn't buy again."

We decided to go with this version as it has a rechargeable battery which is a lot better than having to replace the batteries. This collar was a dream come true for about 3 months and worked great. My golden retriever puppy stayed in our mostly square 1 acre yard which has a very busy road that's very close. He got shocked a few times and he was so scared to go towards the invisible line for months after that. But after 3 months the collar started going off randomly when our puppy was outside wearing it and he would come running to me and was literally crying out loud because it was shocking him and he didn't do anything wrong. I read the directions and it said that things can interfere with it, but there was nothing around.... now we have had it about 5 months and if we leave the collar sitting on the table it will Just randomly beep and shock several times. I recently went out to test the invisible fence to see if the collar even beeped where it was supposed to, and I was happy to find that it did still work and I tested the shock with my hand (it hurts), however my dog is apparently so used to it going off whenever it wants, he is no longer scared of the beep and shock and has learned that he can just break the fence and keep going without a problem. I had already gone over the return policy date when it stopped working properly and the return instructions stated that I needed to return the system and they would determine if it were defective. Honestly I just didn't want to deal with it, so we keep using it to attempt to scare him, and we run like crazy to get it off him when it goes off in the house for no reason. We really wanted to be excited about this collar, but we aren't."

Why did I cancel: 1. Low quality seeds that the birds were not really interested in as much as other seeds I have purchased. 2. A lot more mess and leftovers. 3. Constantly having to clean out the feeders because the seeds start growing plants in the feeders! They then block up the holes so birds can't get seeds out and then turns into this sort of sludge at the bottom (that smells terrible and is hard to get out). Definitely problematic if you live somewhere that rains a lot or you have your feeders somewhere with sprinklers. 4. I have never had this experience with other seeds before but there were things in the bag of seeds that were not seeds. Husks and twigs or something. Only reasons I didn't give this one star was price and well it kept the squirrels away as the seeds didn't carry the value they apparently wanted.

However, most of what it included ended up being problematic.

1. Water dish-- the water dish is made of marbled resin and fits in a corner. It's nice, but mine had a big crack in it and immediately leaked out any water I put in it.

2. Water bowl-- this is Fluker's ""lagoon"" model, small size, and I love it-- it is a bathing pool with steps so that the crab can easily get in or out. However, mine did not hold water. It did not have an obvious crack like the water dish, but it drained more quickly than it should have had it only been under the effects of evaporation. After returning this kit I bought two Fluker's lagoon bowls to use for both fresh and salt water (the one in this kit is green; the separately sold ones are tan).

3. Food dish-- marbled resin like the other two products, this does a fine job of holding food.

4. Sponge-- the sponge is pretty small (half a golf ball?), but seems fine. I think sponges are overrated.

5. Crab pellets-- I have no issue with these.

6. Fresh water conditioner-- this is okay, but it requires four drops to 8 oz of water-- twice as much as Zoomed, and a lot more than some other conditioners. What's really bad is, it does not come in a dropper bottle or with a dropper. Considering you're going to need like 18 drops to do 2 liters of water, not having a dropper is extremely problematic. The Zoomed conditioner comes in a dropper bottle.

7. Salt water conditioner-- this is fine; it's 1 tsp per 8oz, same as Zoomed, and no need for a dropper here.

8. Thermometer-- I don't like this much; only even numbered temperatures are labeled-- it goes from 60 to 80 with just a dash for 70, which I think makes it hard to read.

9. Hydrometer-- this is easier to read than the thermometer, and I like it fine. Impossible to know how accurate it is, but it certainly goes gradually up when I spray water, and slowly goes down as the tank dries out.

10. Empty Growth Shells-- these are nice enough; fairly large, too big for my crab. No way of knowing if they'll be the right size for your crabs, but it never hurts to have extras.

11. Spray bottle-- this works nicely, though honestly you can buy an adjustable misting bottle just like this at the dollar store for $1.

The kit also annoying recommends buying a calcium supplement but doesn't actually include any.

I might give this kit four stars or five stars if not for the leaky dishes and lack of a dropper for the fresh water conditioner, but those are big problems for me. I ended up returning it."

I tried walking her around the perimeter with a choke collar to show her areas that were off limits, but she would still run off. I did extensive research on training collars and decided to go with this one. It has a larger range than most I was looking at and it has the positive and negative tone which I really liked. It only took a few times for my puppy to figure out what each of the tones and static shock meant. I have had this product for a little over a month and I could not be happier. I do not have to use the static control much anymore, and if I do it is on the lowest level and she comes running! I am very pleased! I would definitely recommend this product!"

Turns out I was horribly wrong.

The first unit arrived and I cleaned it like I would do if I was buying something for myself, I don't want my dog to drink up packing dust and whatever else might be on/in the bowl. After doing so I set it up and filled the tank. The water filled the bowl and I didn't notice any problems. I set up the bubbler and it seemed to work, but I noticed that one side was definitely bubbling a LOT more then the other. I didn't think too much of it and walked away, not quite sure what to do with the air pump that kind of just sits there (they do NOT provide a place underneath this thing for the pump, so it just has to sit at the back of the unit.)

I come back to see how its going and maybe fit the pump under the unit when i felt water underneath the bowl. I quickly picked it up and noticed there was a hole underneath the bowl about the size of a .5mm headphone jack, maybe a little bit bigger. I also noticed this hole is there due to poor manufacturing because I saw how the bowl is molded together and it seems to...lack at where the hole is. I thought this might be a single problem and might be able to fix it myself. I dumped the water out and got some epoxy out...which is when I noticed that the air tubes were cracked which is why it was bubbling more on one side then the other. I was like ok, this is BS so I'm going to have amazon send me a new one.

Amazon quickly replaced the unit with another one. This unit had the SAME PROBLEM. The air hoses are directly on top of the hole so you THINK this will cover the problem but it does not. The unit still leaks water...and honestly if you are making a bowl for a dog to hold WATER there should not be ANY HOLES AT ALL...oh but the air hoses weren't cracked this time...

This pretty much ends my review of this, I hope they manage to fix this problem because this is a good idea but with poor manufacturing processes and horrible quality review (honestly if there was ANY quality review this would have been caught and fixed.) this will never get anywhere. I will have to take my business elsewhere."

He usually throws a fit whenever I put anything on his bald patches, this I just showed him the jar and he came right to me wagging his tail. I knew this was making him feel better, but actually came to have me put it on him was unbelievable! It smells great and I enjoy putting it on him as I get to rub the excess into my hands.

1,one dog literally inhale food worry would come serious harm result food partially inhale pretty scary would eat really fast stand choke tremble long period time try everything nothing change eating pattern nature order one bowl revelation first moment force completely change eat speed slow way cough choke anymore bowl light intense become eating bowl slide around floor thus slow considerably bowl probably save life recommend one bowl wellconstructed whole point make plastic bowl slide around floor slide prohibit dog gulp large quantity food one bite highly recommend bowl use pet eat much quickly,"One of my dogs literally inhales her food and I was worried that she would come to some serious harm as a result of her food being partially inhaled, It was pretty scary, she would eat really fast and then stand there choking and trembling for long periods of time, We tried everything with her, but nothing changed her eating pattern, it was just her nature.

I ordered one of these bowls for her and it was a revelation! From the first moment, she was forced to completely change her eating speed, she slowed way down and did not cough and choke anymore. The bowl is light and the more intense she becomes about eating,the more the bowl slides around on the floor..... thus slowing her down considerably!

This bowl has probably saved her life, I recommend this to one and all. The bowl is well-constructed,the whole point of it being made from plastic is that the bowl will slide around on the floor.  The sliding prohibits the dog from gulping down large quantities of food in one bite. I highly recommend this bowl for use with pets that eat much too quickly."

I don't think my Chihuahua likes it much.  She hadn't peed in the house for two months or in her bed for three months.  I felt she was finally house broken.  Then, in less than a week, she peed in this new bed. Yes, the cover is washable.  But it's as thin as a pillow-case.  What is inside is nothing but a shaped piece of foam with a heater embed in it.  In only one week, my Chihuahua puppy has managed to pull hundreds, if not thousands of pieces from the foam without even yet tearing through the cover. When I took the cover off to wash it I had to use a vacuum to get all the pieces of foam off the inside of the cover so they wouldn't clog up my washing machine.  Getting the cover back over the molded foam is a project all its own.  My puppy hasn't peed in the house again in the few days I've been drying out the hosed down foam mold.  We'll see what happens when I try it again one more time.  But I wouldn't recommend this bed to anyone.  At the very least it needs a heavier shaped cover to prevent a dog from digging through it and to facilitate putting back on after removal."

Once the home was put together and it was time to put in the different floors the only issue that I found was 1 floor would pop out shortly after it being snapped in.

I can barely stand to be in my apartment with this litter. I have two cats, and normally when I walk into my apartment, I smell nothing. I took for granted that I used a good litter. The ads for this made it sound amazing, so I thought it was worth a try. It does not hide any odors. As soon as my cat poops, I know it; not so with my other litter. It also barely clumps, I have all these tiny pieces that roll off and escape when when I scoop. So I always feel that the litter is ""dirty"" even after one use. I normally buy: Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, Unscented. That is a product I would recommend to anyone. I now know how magical it is after trying Multi-Cat Clump&Seal.  I would not wish Clump and Seal on my worst enemy. And I don't agree that you should have to take 10 other precautions to not have a smelly house if you have cats. With Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, I had to do nothing extra to have a dwelling that did not stink.  I would not recommend this to someone that had one cat, much less multiple."

Yes this is unstable like I've read in other reviews.  Luckily this defect is obvious and easily fixed, so in my opinion this aspect is of little danger to a kitty of a smart pet owner.  The real problem is with the hanging ball.  It does not hang from sting as you'd assume, instead it's elastic.  Yesterday, my kitty Joe was playing with the ball and the elastic somehow wrapped around his little paw.  Thank God my boyfriend was home for lunch.  He heard Joe's cries from across the house.  Joe's hind legs were on the ground and he was stretched to his entire length because one of his front paw was trapped in the elastic.  My boyfriend said it was wrapped around it really good and as it only got tighter as Joe tried to rip his paw free, there is no way this cat would've gotten free on it's own.  It was wrapped so tight my boyfriend had use scissors to cut Joe free.  It makes me sick to think what cou'dve happened.  If you have this item or plan on getting it.  Please please remove the ball toy first.  It's just not worth the fear and potential danger."

Glad I did.

It did not fit at all. I adjusted the collar as far as it would go to make it shorter, but it only would adjust a few inches of difference. I put it back on my dog, but the size was still waaay too big. So, I measured her neck which she showed to take a size 19 (same as the last time I measured her).

The box of this collar (for size Large) states it is adjustable between size 18 to 27. There is no way to adjust for a length any shorter than 23 Inches!

I am not sure what to rate this collar. It works.. looks great.. but beware of the sizing problem. Due to the electrical unit/cord that runs the length of the collar, it cannot slip through the bucket to shorten beyond the short section which does not have the electrical area.

With that said, Amazon was great! They agreed to refund the collar in full."

I agree with those who point out there is a MAJOR design flaw.  because the strap connects at the bottom front (against your back) , the back of the carrier sags significantly and drags the upper strap back with the sagging. This then is uncomfortable both for the animal and for the human.  I am under the impression that IF the strap were connected toward the back of the carrier instead of directly to the front edge,  it MIGHT work much  better.  We bought two of these and they are essentially unusable the way they are.  It seems obvious that the manufacturer did not try these before sending them to production."

I am not sure if I just received a bad battery, but in the end, all NiMH and NiCad batteries will lose their power and ability to hold a charge. I hope they release a Lith. version of this clipper.

Update 8/28/13

I have decided to drop my rating to two stars since the unit died on me in less than a year (I ended up pulling out the old pair of clippers I had that I purchased at Walmart for $30). I purchased the Wahl clipper oil, and I clean and oil my clippers after every use. I am not sure what kind of battery is inside this unit, but I really think they should upgrade this product with a lithium version. NiCad and NiMH batteries are extremely out of date, and their performance is extremely poor compared to lithium batteries."

I went straight to the super-feed.com website and ordered the combo deal #20 for $161.24, shipped.  I received the item promptly and had it set up in about 30 minutes.  Later, I bought < $3 in hardware and built my own stand.  Some kind of stand is highly recommended.  I loaded the hopper with Iams Weight Control cat food and programmed the digital timer.  Iams cat food seems to be the perfect size and shape for the unit.  It has worked flawlessly for a solid week.  I did not purchase the guard that fits over the dispenser, and my cat has not figured out how to steal from it yet.  If she does, I'll just buy the shield.  Already I've noticed my cat does not yell for her food in the morning and evening.  She still comes around and makes a few polite inquiries just before meal time, but she is getting the idea that I no longer control when she gets fed.  It's been great for our relationship.  Now I can also leave town for long weekends without worrying about her.  This is simply the perfect product for my needs!

i'm thinking of making a video review of what I have to do with this litter.. i'm not the one that bought the litter so i have to deal with it until i can convince them not to buy it  (but outside of the dust it's better than arm & hammer ultra which smells chemical, and then just smells period because baking soda doesn't block cat smells, sorry a&m but it doesn't)..  but I literally take the new litter outside, not just outside, but to the near front of my driveway.. and then i proceed to pour the litter out of its bag into a bucket.... 'from 4 feet in the air'.. this dissipates the dust..no really i swear it does.. kind of..  i look like i'm pouring flour into the buckets.. and this litter has a smell that sticks to your nose so i try to make sure the wind is going the other way.. but i go bucket to bucket about 10 times.. it's funny while you stand there your mind tries to reason just how much dust can come out of this litter.. so after 10 or so buckets of conceding defeat to the remaining dust, eventually you just pour it in the litter pan and then it goes into the house..  now 4 days later, every time i go to scoop the litter pan, a cloud of dust comes up at me.. and this stuff covers everything that is near the litter pan in our kitchen.. canned goods etc..  it's the dustiest litter i've ever used, and believe me i'm a darned connoisseur of litter..  the best kind we've used is the Tidy Cats scoopable in the yellow bucket with the red lid.. though sometimes it can have a bleach smell at first, but not often..  but the overall best litter i have ever used came to me in a product test where the company sent me some to try.. i have no idea what is the brand, but it was made from walnut shells.. i kid you not.. it was virtually dust free and it retained a fresh smell (or should i say, little to no smell.. if anything it smells more fresh to nature up close than chemical like most litters now) for the entire time I used it.. and those that have cats know it's a miracle if a product can block the smell of their litter..  it usually has to be enzyme based or forget it.. but walnuts kept the smell away.. and it clumped well...  i didn't have to empty the box with a significant amount of usable litter like most times because it just gets a bad smell and you have to change it.. the walnut type was good to the end..  so i'm on the hunt for something like that..

but this fresh step litter is just dust heaven.. use it once and you'll see what i mean.. clumps well but the dust isn't worth it..

but if you're looking for a good litter, look for one that is made from walnut shells."

I triple-locked the treats (ziplock on product, inside a big ziplock bag, packed in a plastic container with a rubber seal.

Not worth it for the price. Hoping to try again when my cat gets older, and maybe he won't be as curious."

BECAUSE THEY ARE FAKE REVIEWS!
I can't believe these great 5 star comments are actually from customers and not from staff members. The coop is so small my chickens cry when they see me. Their heads hit the roof when in the outdoor run, plus it's so small there is no way four chickens can walk freely without running into each other. It's truly animal cruelty! The sleeping area has a small perch for two chickens. So where do the other two sleep?
My friend purchased this and immediately painted it so I didn't get to see it before it was painted. I would have told him to send it back had I seen how flimsy it is. It WILL fall over in a wind. If an animal tries to climb on it, it will topple and kill your chickens. The materials used are junk! The lock broke in half when I tried to open a door. The hinges for the ladder are way too small and will break when you move the coop. The ladder runs into a wall. Don't waste your money on this crap. You will not have happy chickens. You can hire someone to build a better coop from scratch for a lot less."

I owned the first generation baby biorb and it finally started leaking about two weeks ago - and I had to think about another aquarium for my betta Fred who has been thriving in the baby biorb.  It's so easy, keeps the temp constant with my small heater and its easy easy to clean.  I modified it a bit to keep the bubbles at bay and it just works great.  that said, it started leaking... ugh a slow leak and I started research other small 3-4 gallon tanks.... and I came back to the baby biorb!  I am so glad I did!  They totally upgraded the light (it is now totally automatic - it changes from light to dark based on the light in room) and the inside of the tank is a bit easier to deal with (the space where you put the rocks and the filter is more defined - makes it easier to clean).  Anyways, it is also just gorgeous - did I mention that?  It looks great on my entry table coming into house - Fred seems to enjoy it, his silk like plans and log look fantastic in the biorb and it is just plain easy to manage.  I am so glad I came back to this.  I was thinking of another fluval chi - that I also have for my 2 female bettas - also lovely tank but not as easy to clean, manage and not as ideal for bettas as the biorb.  The price is right!  When I bought this about 6 years ago it was well over $150 plus all the stuff - now this upgraded tank with the moonlight light -is around $60!  It almost makes me want to get another betta!!!!  You do need a heater - and a betta floating log (because they will be so happy) and you are set!"

After three weeks of that I tore the whole tank apart and when I pulled this out I saw that a lot of the paint was missing and I tossed it. It's been two weeks since then and my water is back to normal so it could have only been one thing. I do still have and use the airstone that came with it it's just hidden by plants now though only half of it produces bubbles.
1,product work exactly like description thing remember loud sound set ca nt leave turn extended period time mainly use house quiet dog likely bark unknown sound outside test outside neighbor dog bark stop like product multiple level low med high strength control effectiveness also little green light come controller activate emit sound know work change battery,"The product  works exactly like the description.

The only thing to remember is that any loud sound can set it off, so you can't leave it turned on for extended periods of time.  I mainly use it when the house is quiet as that's when my dog is most likely to bark at unknown sounds outside.

I tested it outside when the neighbor's dog was barking and it stopped them, too.  :)

What I like most about this product is that there are multiple levels (low, med, high) of strength so you can control the effectiveness.  Also, a little green light comes on when controller is activated (emitting sound) so you know when it's working or when to change the batteries."

He will push it around the house for hours. I love that you can add parts to make it a little more difficult because my dachshund caught on pretty fast. Only reason I rate this a four and not a five is because it's all plastic and makes so much noise rolling across my hardwood floors. Also, everywhere my dog takes it he runs it into something. So when he's pushing it around in the living room it's beating up my furniture. Thinking if this was made of a different material it might be quieter and not so harsh on my furniture and floors."

She wears it all day long.  I take it off of her at night and it goes right back on her in the morning.  I charge the collar about every third day.  This unit is very well built.

These are a terrible design.  Under-powered and the charcoal filters are a joke.  Cats don't care about ""taste"" they just want it to be moving and aerated.  I have two male cats with urinary problems and the vet was always saying to ""get them to drink more water"" but how do you do that???  I almost came back to buy a more expensive version of these knowing I was just throwing my money away.  Then I saw some you tube videos of people making them themselves.  I bought a cheap aquarium filter (the $10 kind you use for turtle tanks) and viola.  Cats were terrified of it and again wouldn't get near it but I just left it.  It didn't take long however before everything in the neighborhood was GUZZLING out of it (I have it outside).  Today it was 36 degrees so it's not frozen but for the last two weeks it's been in the teens and the running part never froze even though it had ice all around it.  First winter I haven't had to deal with frozen solid water dishes.  More importantly it's the only water source around for animals in the winter and I don't mind helping my neighbors pets out :)  Just from cats (it's in my fenced back yard) I've been adding a 1/2 gallon of water a day.  In my picture it looks tipped but that's because my cat knocks it a little when he drinks.  I can see on Amazon I bought the filter on September 14th (Tetra Whisper In-Tank Filter up to 20 gallons) and there has been no maintenance other than replacing water as of today November 24th."

I suspect the first one disappeared from scratching.  The second, I am not sure at all... the dog is a wild child so no telling what she got herself into.  That one ended up with the bottom of the clip broken off in less than a month.  Also had ordered both in blue, the one that stayed on for just shy of a month already showed signs of wear and I could see the silver underneath.

I had to have a friend forcefully grab her and hold her eye open and even then I had to stick the tip of the dropper in to make sure it was getting in her eye. I would MUCH rather prefer that they made a queez bottle that you can point and squeez into the dogs eye. That way even if the dog moves the stream can follow and the product will soak the eye.

Now I know why. It is fine and will work well for the dog content to be in the crate. But as a few others have pointed out it is a very thin gauge wire. Because it is thinner than the crates you find in the stores it does not feel very sturdy - however, I believe it will be fine for me. This is our third crate and the other two are substantially thicker wire and feel very sturdy and secure. I hope this works out - I'm betting it will but if I had to do it again I would pay more more a thicker gauge wire and better quality.

UPDATE: (also removing a Star)
After 1 month of use I have had to fix the door, use fasteners (tie-wraps) to hold it together and straighten the wires several times. The wire is about the strength of laundry mat hangers. It bends super easy and for this size crate 42""x27"" and the size of dog you would put in this it is just way too flimsy. Our dog just gets excited to see us and paws at the door and he bends the wire all up.

Last issue. This comes with a worthless divider. It can not be used for anything except making the crate space smaller. You can not get to half the crate because the side door is smack in the center of the crate and it opens towards the front door. So you can not divide the crate in a way that allows access to the second area. Also unless you just want a 4"" section you will have to put the divider on the side door making the side door useless. So if you need a big crate that can be divided into two useable sections keep looking."

I liked the harness so much that I ordered another one in a different color.

Best bags I've used. They are a big thicker and darker than many other eco bags. Thus, they are more secure and discrete. They tear off the roll easily and don't tear where they shouldn't. The scent is unlike any other bag I've used. I can only describe it as being part of the bag and not added to it. The scent isn't overpowering and doesn't fade. My 1st order was done in error. The listed price at that time was just a test amount the seller was using while setting up his account. It was unbelievably small. Instead of just telling me the bags weren't available at that price and cancelling out the order, he sent a reasonable number of bags, a holder, and a sample dog magazine.

Bought because my dog gets freaked out by all of the fireworks on the 4th of July as many neighbors have arial boomers and we were planning to go to the city display and leave her at home. The dog has worn many coats in cold weather so is used to that - and this is like a windbreaker. It provided no benefit whatsoever and simply annoyed her. Just logged in to amazon to return and apparently the return window has closed - less than a month. My bad. Its probably because they know this thing is junk and hope you're not paying attention to purchasing details. I bought this because of the TV commercials and raving reviews which I suspect are fake. Save your money.

It was getting gross. Well, this one was way worse to clean and even more disgusting.

Cons:
-The lid stopped shutting, so if I didn't go over and close it every time after it went off, it would make the bathroom smell
-Poop got stuck to the rake
-It scared the hell out of my cat (later on, not at first)
-It would constantly break and the little red light would blink
-A few times it just kept going and going and going and going and going
-And if you know how loud it is, the above can be annoying
-I'd spend more time cleaning it out/fixing it then I ever did with my normal, non-automatic litter box
-After about a month and a half when it began dis-functioning more often than not, Oliver stopped using it and would pee outside the litter box
-It was gross pulling out the poop tray
-I never saw clumps on pee in the tray, I believe that is because it sank to the bottom when the rake pushed over it (It could be that I didn't have a good enough clumping litter, but it was the same litter I used before with my old box and it clumped just fine)

Pros:
-It fit perfect under the bathroom sink (yay for good measurements)
-It was nice to have when we first moved in, something extra I didn't have to worry about for a few days (unless any of the above happened)
-Oliver took a liking to it right away (but stopped using it eventually)

Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this product. I wouldn't recommend an automatic litter box at all, but that's just my opinion. Lesson learned. I'll never return!"

I have 1 betta in the tank with a few decorations. However the problem is the waterfall is wayyy to strong for him. I did the hack I've seen in the other reviews by using a water bottle to help slow the stream. It kinda works but my betta still can't use 50% of the tank because he will get flopped around. I also had to add a plant under the filter because he had almost gotten sucked up.

I am also not sure but as soon as I got this tank his fins started the ""fin rot"" I have tried treating it but I think it's him always struggling with the current. Because my tank is cleaned regularly.

I wish I would have returned it in time."

It was obvious he was hurting and his weight was creeping up. I suspected glucosamine would help him, but he'd refused the chewable pills in the past. I saw these & decided to try them. Since he's a small dog, his weight means he only needs 1/4-1/2 a piece per day. I cut them in quarters and he gets one every morning. He loves them. After a month, he was a completely different dog! He loves going for walks. He plays with our other younger pup. He seems happy and young again. He's even lost weight because he's so active again.

It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional ""sweeping step"" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have ""strained"" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method."

1,dog love small still give frequent treat without much worry fatten dog much needy type dog expect treat paw wipe come walk usually take three four treat completely wipe butt seventy-eight treat time come walk bag ton nt run quickly,My dog loves these.  They are small so I can still give frequent treats without too much worry about fattening up my dog too much.  She's the needy type of dog that expects a treat for each paw of hers that I wipe after we come in from a walk.  It usually takes 3 or 4 treats to completely wipe her butt.  That's 7-8 treats each time we come in from a walk.  Each bag has a ton so I don't run out quickly.

1,purchase bird cage girlfriend along two parakeet although cage come instruction find easy assemble cage snap together fit seem bit loose use small white zip tie happen hand reinforce joint cage look good shelf convenient wheel make easy move around seem roomy enough two bird would recommend good starter cage small bird,"I purchased this bird cage for my girlfriend along with two parakeets.  Although the cage comes with no instructions, I found it easy to assemble.  The cage snaps together and the fit seemed a bit loose, so I used small white zip ties (I happened to have on hand) to reinforce the joints.  The cage looks good and the shelf below is very convenient.  The wheels make it very easy to move around and it seems to be roomy enough for the two birds.  I would recommend this as a good starter cage for small birds."

Our bird currently lives in a beautiful Avian Adventures large cage that is high quality & arrived in perfect condition. This item is a miniature version of the cage we have but the quality is no comparison. The cage panels are bent, all if the the door closure hardware is flimsy, cheap & difficult to use, there are numerous deep scratches (thanks for the included touch up paint but some of the scratches have sharp edges that have to be sanded smooth), scratches in the tray that were previously touched up with paint & the included rope perch is a cheap Booda knock off with plastic ends that stripped the first time we tried to secure them to the cage. We had to use pliers to bend pieces so they would fit together & the bowl holders had to be forced in with a hammer. Not sure if this was a previously returned cage or a close-out or what but wow, not happy & not the typical quality of Avian Adventures! Serious quality issues! We are keeping it & will fix what we have to because this is a temporary housing cage that won't be used very often & the price was lower than other sites, but buyer beware!"

I bought two (large & x-large). One was going into a crate for Smooth Collie who is crated only at night, and the other was to be for a much better behaved Rough Collie.  When I first laid them out, neither dog was interested.  At bedtime, the Smooth went into his crate.  All night I heard sliding and crunching around.  The bottom fabric is a thin stiff nylon with a rubberized texture (dots).  It literally crunches when touched so you hear every move the dog makes.  When I let him out in the morning, he grabbed the bed, pulled it out of the crate and dragged it to the patio door. While doing so, he tore the nylon fabric (not at a seam) and pulled off a chunk of the foam inside which is just a thin piece of corrugated memory foam.  My other dog sat on his new bed for a few minutes and then laid down on the tile floor.

Lucky that I sew.  I'm going to add padding to both beds and replace the crunchy fabric with something softer and quieter and see how that goes.  The beds they were replacing were from 1999 used by other dogs I had and I've made covers for them to re-use them over the years.  I bought these because they were on sale, reasonably priced and thought my guys would like them.  If the new covers I make don't lure them into using them, I'll donate them to the shelter."

That really confused me. Also, there was practically *no way* to adjust it so the clip wasn't resting right at her 'armpit' causing her discomfort. Not okay. It did help *some* to deter her pulling, but not enough to put her through the trouble of having a hot-spot created where the clip rested."

Initially, he loved it with his blankets and toys in there with him. Low and behold we left him in there by himself for the first time and that's where the chaos happened. For starters the mesh side is not that durable as he broke right though this. He realized he would not fit out the hole but if he shifted his weight he could turn the whole thing on it's side. So that's what he did. My husband came home to the pup running through the house inside of playpen like a hamster in a wheel. Somehow he figured out how to pull a shoe through the hole he had made so that was in there too, while he was running through the house like a deranged gerbil."

Definitely go by the size chart and hopefully you'll have an easier taking your dog's measurements than I did. With all that aside, this is certainly a blessing of a contraption for a dog with a big chest, bulbous head and little neck. I have seen a lot of harnesses that have to go over a dogs head first and that was not an option for my dog. The entire back opens up and closes with a very sturdy insert buckle and a large area of velcro. She has enough room in the neck area while still fitting snuggly safe in the body. When she runs out of leash (at a very fast pace I might add), her whole body is stopped; there is no whiplash or choking effect. The harness washes easily in the washer and dries quickly by just air drying. The camo pattern is a really cute too."

He had started training from birth to use a pad, and at six weeks we continued, so he already knew to use them.  He also goes outside of course, but these come in handy during the night.

When a fresh pad is put down, he enjoys laying on it in front of the window and sunning himself.  Having them delivered right to my door is nice."

My German shepherd loved it at first sight.  She climbed right up on it, and I have even caught my toddler cuddled up on the bed with the dog.

The design is simplicity itself with only four screws to tighten, but assembly could be a challenge to some, I suppose.  Read some of the reviews that mention assembly, and you'll get an idea of what you're dealing with.  The reviews which had detailed instructions were most helpful to me, but I can make things simple.

All you need to know is that you should wait until the bed is fully assembled before you tighten the screws all the way.  I just barely finger-tightened all four screws and then had my seven-year-old lie across the bed while I tightened the screws with a screwdriver. The bed frame will go slightly askew when you pick it up to move it, but once you set it back on the ground or floor it will straighten out.  No wobbles at all. After assembly, as I mentioned above, my 90 lb. German shepherd happily jumped on the bed without hesitation.

If I end up moving it a lot, I'll be sure to tighten the screws every few months or so.  However, I'd feel comfortable disassembling and reassembling it for travel.

I paid $29 and change for the bed (it has gone up $4 in price since I purchased it four days ago), which is less than any of the orthopedic or otherwise fancy-schmancy beds I have seen on Amazon or elsewhere.

The Coolaroo is a bargain."
0,rat buy big small one even big one leave barely enough room cat business sometimes end kick turd box wall funny doorway work easily hassle expensive waste,"Rated this before.  We bought a big and small one.  Even the big one leaves barely enough room for the cat to do his business, and he sometimes ended up kicking turds out of the box or all over the wall because of the funny doorway.

Does not work very easily and is a hassle.  And it's expensive.  What a waste."

It spun twice a day, and was very reliable. It did break after just about a year and a couple months - the motor just stopped motoring! It would move about an inch instead of the full spin. If you buy one, I would keep an eye on your feeder the moment it's coming up to it's one year birthday just in case, or later if yours is only used sporadically. (it does have a one year warranty by the way) I still give it almost full stars because when I called in to troubleshoot the device with the company the help I received was very kind, friendly, and they shipped me out a new one when we couldn't get it working. And for about $35, even if it breaks every year and a half of CONSTANT use.. I guess it's still worth it to keep my kitty eating healthy. :) Maybe we can put in a better motor in the future? or if not.. a replaceable one??? :)"

It is light and super comfy for the dog and since it's not fully inflated, they don't bump into things in a jarring fashion. They just push past furniture, doorways etc. Also,it's really easy to slip on. At least for this dog, works far far better than the ""cone of shame"". And my shins are thankful too."

0,theory product great however execution leave something desire roll box clean cause litter fall side joint matter careful put together end duct tap two half together sort solve problem make hard take apart refillclean seem like space something allow litter escape also well way put delicately cat particularly softrunny poo box repeat soft poos go splat everywhere inside roll fun might able wait harden cat would nt use box poo inside nt work well either additionally cat grow sofast may big cat even buy kitten almost small regular large box put tray hood conclusion great theory nt soft pooper execution fail bit literleaking problem fact regular nt large least nt think much good result large rubbermaid container wa hole cut lid convenient clean theory behind would nt work convenient either,"The theory of this product is great. However, the execution left something to be desired.  Rolling the box to clean it caused litter to fall out of the sides (the joint) no matter how careful I was when I put it together.  We ended up duct taping the two halves together, which sort of solved the problem, but made it hard to take apart to refill/clean. It seems like there was a space or something that allowed litter to escape.

Also... well, there's no way to put this delicately, but if you have a cat with particularly soft/runny poo, this is NOT the box for you.  I repeat-- NOT for you. Soft poos just... go splat EVERYWHERE inside when you roll it.  Not fun.  And you might be able to wait for them to harden (if they do), but my cat wouldn't use the box if there was any poo inside of it at all. So that didn't work so well either.

Additionally, my cat grew out of this SO.FAST. It may be just because he was a big cat, but even when we bought it for him as a kitten, it was almost too small.  The regular is just not a large box, once you put the tray in and the hood on.

So, in conclusion-- great theory (if you don't have a soft pooper), but the execution fails a bit, in the liter-leaking problem and the fact that the regular just isn't all that large (at least I don't think so.)  We had much better results with a large rubbermaid container w/a hole cut in the lid.  Not as convenient to clean as the theory behind this would be, but then again, this didn't work out to be so convenient either."

I wanted to bring the new puppy on camping trips. Most sites in NJ require a 6ft lead at all times, if they allow dogs at all.  Well I read a few reviews that mentioned the carabiner gate flipping open. Well its no exaggeration! The first night (at home) of testing the leash, my 5 month old puppy was just sniffing this way & that way, not really tangling the leash, just twisting the leash like a twizzler. Next thing I know I'm holding a leash with no dog attached to it. Luckily my puppy hadn't realized this & was still nearby. I calmly walked up to him & put the leash back on. Thinking it was a freak occurrence, I gave it another chance. Well my wife walked him the next morning with the same result. FAIL! I can't imagine if this happened on the trail, he would have taken off in black bear country. This needs to be redesigned. I highly recommend the comparable Ruff Wear Roamer leash. I picked this up at EMS due to time constraints, and it does exaclty what I wanted to do. If Shockles can get a locking carabiner in place of the clip style than that would solve the gate problem. Otherwise good concept, poor execution."

She doesn't seem to mind it too much, though she does try to rub it off her face at times.  The part that goes over her nose seems to have caused a very small amount of hair loss due to the friction.  I'm hoping that I won't have to use the leader for a long time once she learns to walk a bit better, so I think the hair issue won't be much of a problem.  The purple color is great."

I learned in the past he is very rough on these toys and I have to be careful when buying these toys that he doesn't choke or even swallow harmful things from these toys. I respect KONG toys in making good toys for dogs who love to chew. So I thought I would try these squeaker balls. These balls died on the first day. My dog had them torn apart in a matter of minutes. You may think I might have bought the wrong size and I have a large dog. I actually have a very small dog and so buying a large ball for him I thought it would harder for him to kill. I was wrong. Please don't buy this product if you cherish you family member. It is easily destroyed and the squeaker in this toy is potentially dangerous to your dog. I have found that the Chuckit! balls stand up to my little dog's mean jaws. Don't by buy the squeaker balls. Not worth it at all!!!!

I saw the great reviews, and thought this would be just the thing.  However, once he received the initial shock, he would yelp, and then it would shock him again and cause him to yelp again. This would continue until I removed the collar, leaving him into a sorry, whimpering pup with no idea what just happened. The zaps, even at the lowest setting, were way too strong. Not only was it ineffective in this manner, but it would also be set off by his moving and jumping, or any other sounds near him. This lead to constant beeping and shocking. I was horrified, and now have reason to believe that the reviews were purchased. This is junk, and the worst product I have ever purchased."

It was worth the wait. Here's why...

I had taken my dog to our vet twice due to her licking ""down there"". I suspected it might be stones, was told there were no signs and sent home with an ointment. Last November when I took her to the ER for a heart condition, they did an X-ray and by chance saw there were stones in her bladder. I was upset that my regular vet hadn't taken my concerns seriously before. But... here we were. I'm dealing with a 12-year-old miniature schnauzer with a heart condition, not exactly a candidate to put under anesthesia to remove stones. Dealing with stones became my second priority.

I did my research online and found this product. Read reviews. Decided to give it a try in December 2017.

I proceeded to give her the correct dosage with 30 days on, 7 days off. I repeated this for four months, until April 2018. I took her back to her veterinarian for X-rays. THE STONES WERE GONE. In May, she turned 13. To say I was relieved is to say the least.

She started seeing a holistic vet (get one if you have the means) in May. Interestingly enough, this vet has never heard of Chanca Piedra. I explained what I was doing. I wasn't going to stop.

I took her off Break It Up in June (it's mid-July 2018 as I write this) and she's started licking again. As I've done my research - and perhaps you're doing the same - it seems that even humans take this as a ""maintenance"" supplement to keep bladder/kidney stone issues at bay. And perhaps that's what I will continue to do with her. Because it's been four days now since she started taking Break It Up again, and the licking has all but stopped.

If you're still reading this, you're likely like I was. Researching and praying there's an alternative to surgery. It's a natural supplement that's sustainably sourced. My advice? Give it a try, but make sure you give it a few months to work. See if you notice a difference.

I never saw blood in her urine as so many other reviewers had; it was completely her licking that tipped me off that something was ""off."" But using this product and adding water to her food (holistic vet's advice there to make sure she was hydrated and could flush out any stones) has been a potential life-saver for Chloe (first time I'm using her name here!).

My only caution for you, as the pet owner. BE PATIENT. This is a natural diuretic. Your dog or cat WILL need to use the bathroom more. And that's what you want! I expect when I have her on this that I will be getting up around 1 or 2 a.m. for a potty break. And I'm OK with it. I wouldn't want to have to hold it if I had to pee. Please make sure you're available to let your pet out throughout the day so that they're continually flushing their systems.

It's key!

I hope this review was helpful. And I truly hope this works for your dog or cat."

(I did find a mat that does stop the spread of cat litter) I like that this particular design makes it hard for the trapped litter to escape the mat once you pick it up, unlike other similar designs, but the mat was super slippery on a tile floor.

I have had my for 3 years Joey since he was just 3 months old and in all that time he has been riddled with anxiety.  The only place he has ever been comfortable enough to be affectionate is on my bed- I couldn't even pick him up without his entire body going rigid and him struggling to get down.  I found these treats at Petclub and after a week he is no longer hiding in my bedroom, but is out in the rest of the house, sleeping beside me on the couch, and allowing me to pick him up - briefly - without struggling.  And he loves the way they taste!  Looking at the reviews it seems like if your kitty is willing to take them they work quite well, but there seem to be enough kitties out there that are unwilling to eat them that its kind of a 50/50 shot - still well worth trying if your kitty has anxiety in my opinion."

No one product will make everyone happy, but in our experience this is worth the money. The older cones were rigid, opaque, and hard to keep closed. This one is strong, pliable, and clear. The snaps aren't too difficult to fasten, but we have to snap them firmly. Once we do, the collar doesn't come off until we're ready. Just hated having to put one on our dog, but her hot spots were never going to heal unless she could not get at them. She can get to her water and food dishes, however.  Bessie is an 80-pound lab so we got the XL, and it is a good fit. She likes to jump up on the bed, which doesn't bother us. The first day she tried to do that with the collar on, she couldn't. So, she decided she needed to go into the hallway and get a little running start. Cute. This collar is easy to clean and very durable, and because it lies flat we will be able to use it again as the need arises."

So far I've only had it three days....and it's AMAZING!....lately my dog who's a 1 year old husky/golden mix, about 55lbs....has been going on non stop barking fits....no matter how much I've tried to stop or correct him w/ sprays etc...nothing would stop him for more than 5 minutes.  The 1st day I got this collar I didn't put it on him right away.  I waited until he went on a long barking fit and put it on....at first he was more curious as to what the heck this thing was around his neck.....after about 10 minutes of that he let loose his 1st bark...the collar beeped..then zapped...he immediately stopped and sat in the corner of his kennel....not a sound for the next 5 hours.  I took the collar off at night because he's generally good late at night.  The next two afternoons I did the same thing...and the results were exactly the same...This thing really really works...and all it took was 1 zap from level 1 correction....I can also say that it didn't affect his disposition or mood at all..he was still very playful and acted like his normal self....minus the barking....I'm very pleased w/ this so far!"

In the past, it has been such a pain to try and keep it scooped behind her, that inevitably the bathroom started to smell like cat urine. With the Breeze, since the urine drains through the bottom, it is no big deal at all for whoever is in the bathroom to quickly scoop and flush solids, and the pads have so far been lasting about 12 days with one quick rotation halfway through that time period.
  While it does seem as though there are not very many pellets, for my cat who will not really cover anyway, it is not a big deal. I had no issues transitioning her to it- we actually moved in an 800 miles, two-day car trip, I set this up for the first time as soon as we got to our new home, and within 2 minutes she was using it.
As for the cost on it, I did get it on the goldbox special, which helped a lot with the initial costs. I had been looking to get it since it came out, but did not really want to spend upwards of $40 for it, which is how much it was running in local stores.

The brush itself seems constructed well and the pins are well-anchored. However, at least on the brush I received, the ""Flex"" feature seems to mean simply that the brush is not secured adequately to the handle and, instead, rolls around uselessly in circles as I try to brush my dog. She has soft, curly hair that is approximately 2 inches long and regularly brushed. I did not try to rake out deeply-entrenched mats with this brush; rather, I have simply attempted to use it as a finishing brush... to no avail. While some rotation would be acceptable, this limply rolls around and, within two or three passes, the entire brush comes out of the handle! It is absolutely useless. Last I came across the previously-stored brush while looking for another one of my dog's grooming tools; because of its otherwise seemingly good construction, I might try gluing the brush into the handle? That does NOT seem worth it to me. Too bad. I had heard great things about this brand."

My wife and I clean the water dish twice a week which also involves a thorough cleaning of the motor.  I would not recommend this product for this reason alone.  Hopefully this vendor realizes the issue with this product and will upgrade their fountain motor.

Update to my previous review:
Disappointed with this purchase.  The pump went out in the first 6 months,  but the seller did replace it at no charge.  The filtration system does not do a good job at filtering out debris.  It collects in the corner of the bowl, as shown in the picture.
The fountain has to be full almost to the top or it makes a sputtering/ chugging sound.
My biggest complaint is that it is lacking accessible filter replacements.  In the Q and A section a question is asked about where to buy replacement filters, which is followed up by a comment from the seller that they are having issues with their supplier and recommend another filter that belongs to another product. I searched for hours to find a filter that I thought would fit but it didn't.
I will be purchasing another pet fountain from a different vendor.
I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 due to the customer service,  not the product quality.
The product description also states 100% satisfaction guarantee. I'm not sure what that may mean in terms of reimbursement."

the ring at the top has tiny holes all over it. This is so that the hamster can breathe, obviously, but it becomes a problem when the hamster pees up there.

The outhouse part is okay, except that the door is at an angle, which makes it tough to open.

The wheel is fine. It is especially nice if you have a smaller cage because it attaches to the outside. It can be a bit squeeky, but we just spray a bit of cooking oil into the center bar and it stops.

The entire thing (except the wheel) can be difficult to get into place tightly so that it does not wiggle.

Overall, the wheel is the most useful part of the kit."

It does this almost every use. I would avoid any collar using the same reomte control unit pictured, as they all appear to be from the same manufacturer. Returning.
This would get five stars because it does the job, but there are some stupid flaws with this design. First, this is the same collar as sold under various brands here -- most are the rechargeable type. My experience in using this and reviewing it is based on using a different shock collar that broke after six years.
Flaws: 1 -- these have 100 levels of... whatever. You know that scene in Spinal Tap when Nigel is talking about their amps and says ""The numbers all go to eleven. Look, right across the board, eleven, eleven, eleven and..."" I imagine that the design meeting was like that: ""This goes to 100. People will eat it up."" Totally unnecessary. Reading the reviews of other similar collars this seems to confuse people. The levels should be from 1-10. That's it, that's all you need. So think of the 100 levels as 1-10. And you probably won't need to go very high: on my 90lbs Ridgeback I use the vibrate or shock function between 20-30. And I use it rarely, because this is a training tool. I'll get into that later.
Second flaw -- no power switch. It just shuts off after a preset time of less than a minute. That means you need to hit one button on the remote to wake the thing up and then press the *action* button to use it. Stupid design. Let me turn this on when I put it on my dog and turn it off when I remove it. My old collar worked that way, didn't go through batteries all that often (once a year, if that).
Now I'll talk about how to use this, because reading reviews on the other silmilar collars there seems to be some confusion.
--This needs to be tight to your dogs neck. Tight enough that it won't move around as they run and play. If it's loose, it won't work properly.
--The sound/tone mode. I've read complaints that it's barely audible... True. You will barely hear it, and only if your dog is next to you. It's a tone designed for dogs to hear, not humans. Your dog hears it just fine.
--How to use this: It's a training tool. I first started using a shock collar on my Ridgie when he was about 18 months. His recall was nonexistent when he found people with treats at the dog park (quick rant: don't bring treats into the dog park. If you need treats to keep your dog under control at the park, you need to do a better job of training your dog. And not at the park.). And the police told me I couldn't use a taser on the people, so the dog gets a shock collar. My old collar had two buttons, tone and shock. I would hit the tone button and then hit the shock button. After about three shocks my guy recognised the tone as his corrective measure -- no need to shock. Then I would whistle before I used the tone button. Pretty soon he recognised that my whistle meant he was doing something wrong and needed to come back to me. A bit more difficult with this unit because you most likely need to press the button to *turn* it on, press the action button for shock, press the mode button to switch to tone, press the action button for tone. But it can be done.
When it comes down to it you should rarely need to use the shock feature. And very rarely use it at a high level. Walking in the woods and spotting a cougar and your dog wants to chase it off would be a good example (and even then it may not do the trick, speaking from experience). But use this as a proper training tool and train your dog to respond to other stimuli, chances are your dog will behave simply by having the collar on (I had a friend use a collar on her Ridgie for a while. After it broke she just taped a couple of washers to his collar where the box used to sit. The weight made him think the collar was on and he behaved.)"

From the description it sounded like just what I needed. I wasn't sure if it was big enough to match the old one. When it finally arrived I couldn't wait to test it. It was big in size and matched the old one. Throwing it was just as easy. It has enough weight to fly parallel to the ground while he runs and jumps after it and yet light enough to float. The material is soft on his gums and haven't seen any blood yet. He bites it and chews it when handing it over to me to throw again and it holds up. No holes, rips, or tears. Washes easily and dries quick. When I tell him to go get the frisbee he runs into the bedroom and chooses the Booda over the Frisbee and brings it back to me so we can go play. When we finish I tell him to put it back and he returns it to the toy box then goes and lays on an a/c vent to cool off."

He ate orig Wysong for over a year and when I heard of the change, spoke to a representative asking for the orig. She assured me the change was minimal and sent me sample.  I ordered two big bags and before getting half way thru one bag noticed stool changes so bad and frequent I had several vet visits, to check the problem.  After antibiotics and probiotics that did not help, I realized wysongs change of formula, by the vet asking me about food changes.  I  than took this change of formula (Wysong 90 in blue and green bag)away from my ferret.  After months of probiotics and putting my ferret  on a fast for two days, giving him only a canned prescription cat soft food from the vet for two days that he hated,  I finally gave him 2 varieties of totally ferret and continued probiotics.  It took a few months but I was delighted to see his stool finally back to normal.  I still use the other varieties of Wysong such as digestive health but threw away a whole bag and more of this Wysong epigen 90.  I might add, I have 2 ferrets but only one would eat the Wysong changed product.  That made the conclusion clear, since the sick one ate it and other one did not.  The high quality of protein makes Wysong a great food.  It's sad they put ferret owners through such stress over a formula change.  They had a great food and they changed it!"

I purchased this unit in December of 2012 to replace 20-year old Fluval 303 which ran, and ran only to find the 406 completely unusable. The filter would continually simply stop running. I'd thoroughly clean out the filter, clean the impeller well and the impeller, fill the canister, remove any air, plug it in and nothing but a humming noise.

I'd open it back up, do nothing other than take the impeller cover off and put it back on, seal the unit and plug it and it would run anywhere from 10 minutes to 24 hours before just stopping. There was no air bloc, the impeller shaft was in great condition etc... I'd replace the impeller, ceramic shaft and well cover anyway and I still could not get it run reliably.

The ONLY think that worked for me was to use the impeller from my old Fluval 303 in the 406. It would at least run but with less water flow than my old 303 filter did.

Calls and writing to Fluval (Hagen) were left unanswered; thanks for nothing Fluval.

I've since replaced the filter with a AquaTop CF/UV model (they make a 300, 400 and 500) and I'm so far I', very happy with that. The only way to tell that it's running is to watch my plants move, quiet doesn't begin to describe it. The media trays are at least as large as the Fluval 406. There were some features of the 406 that I really liked but if doesn't run, features mean nothing."

She loses interest quickly in plush toys of any variety, and hard plastic toys (like the Tug-A-Jug, made by the same company) make a frightening amount of noise on our hardwood floor.  She hides from the Tug-A-Jug!  This toy is her favorite, though.  We fill it with crumbled beef jerky treats and she will gnaw on it and toss it around for fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. It seems to be a good mixture of texture and treat-dispensing for her. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it's challenging to clean...food gets stuck inside of it and can be hard to remove completely.  Soaking it in very hot, soapy water periodically does a good job of keeping it from smelling bad or growing anything funky."

So keep it coming Canidae, I will continue to use their products if they keep the quality of food high for my pets."

Had the product up for about 4-5 hours and haven't heard a peep from next door. Even though it has been less than 24 hrs. ,I can say with confidence it's worth it's weight in gold. I also have 3 dogs and with the thing pointed at the neighbors, it didn't affect them at all. When I put the battery in I tested it in the house and my 7lb dog ran and hid until I turned it off and took it outside. It doesn't recommend using it on dogs under 8 pounds.
Oooops"

The myth is that bettas can ""Thrive"" in a little bit of water but in reality the bigger, the better.  Bettas are naturally meant to live in rice patties and yes the water is shallow BUT THEY HAVE MILES TO SWIM AROUND!

This may look like an oh so amazing thing but would you want to be attached to the wall hanging on by a nail or so?  If you want a betta fish GET A HEATER http://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-06107-Submersible-Aquarium-150-Watt/dp/B003C5TMU4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1349757537&sr=8-1&keywords=aqueon+heaters and get NO SMALLER THAN A 2.5 GALLON TANK!  Because you're heartless human if you think a betta would enjoy living on your wall and without a heater.  80 degrees in the best temperature for a betta.

SO hopefully someone will read this and think 'Oh how could I be so dumb to think that my betta would actually want to live in that?!' they are simple keepers for those who are smart enough to care.  Get a 2.5 gallon or bigger tank with that heater (set on 80 degrees, 50 watts works as well) and make sure to feed them frozen food (bloodworms are their favorite) or very good pelleted food (New Life Spectrum) and you will have a healthy and happy betta.  You'll also HAVE TO CHANG THE WATER every 3-5 days in tanks between 3.5-2.5 gallons.  This wall tank seems like a wonderful idea but imagine having to take it down every 2-4 days?

So DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE A HEART AND SOUL!  Fish are very misunderstood but just because you cannot hear them doesn't mean they're not upset."

He sees the bags so he is begging now, but he won't get any because I'm afraid to give them to him.  Not happy with this shipment.  I buy these at least once a month, but I have to rethink this."

Her coat was always dry and itchy, and I followed my vet's advice for Nature's Variety Grain Free dog food. It took some time, but this food was amazing! Shedding subsided substantially, skin itching stopped, and all was well. Simply put, do the research and see how good this food is, and see how well-formulated it is.

There is so much junk food in the pet food market today, but Nature's Variety Instinct formula has the proper ratio of protein to fat and is grain free. Similarly, the company doesn't seem to pander to what the average pet owner assumes that dogs need to live well, which, of course, is often wrong. All and all, this is the best made pet food for the best price I have found. Certainly, it is more expensive than the pet market leaders or the big retailers' house brands, but it's a wonderful balance between price and quality. Your pet deserves the extra to live a long healthy life."

By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle!

This is very expensive food, so my suggestion is that you buy a small bag and try it on your cats - my enthusiasm got the best of me and I bought two bags, one large, and many bags of treats - oops. Well, the only good news is that my other cat will eat it. However, I have to feed it to her, and then immediately hide any that remains in her dish, so my sickly cat can't get to it...

He couldn't do anything but lie there. My wife and I felt so sad for him. We had to carry him outside to do his business then carry him back in again. I already bought joint supplements for my mother in law (MSM-Chondroitin) so I knew that these products were designed especially for joint issues. We bought the NaturVet Arthrisoothe for our dachshund and went with the double dose as recommended for the first month. He could walk again, and he even gets excited and can run on occasion. He has been on this product for nearly a year now and is doing great. I have just ordered my second 16 oz. bottle (they last forever for small dogs) and when I was ordering my next bottle I saw nothing but a so-so review of the product and felt I must speak up. He loves the taste! I mix it with his dry food and he does not want to eat without it. Thanks NaturVet! We were so concerned for our pet's pain that we did not know how much longer we could have gone without putting him down. We are going on one year now and couldn't be happier.

Update: 10/08/2009
Well, our little doggie passed away in April just shy of his 14th birthday. However, our sadness was tempered by the quality of his last year of life. We believe the NaturVet Arthrisoothe made all the difference. You'd think I work for the company given the glowing review I give, but I don't. It was just so sad to see him helpless and in pain, and the NaturVet Arthrisoothe gave him the ability to live life. I haven't had the need to give it to our new dog, but the way he jumps around he will no doubt need it some time down the road. One last thing, the 16 oz. bottle lasts a long time for a little dog, so you get your money's worth. Best wishes to all you dog lovers!"

Got the battery in, got the ball in the pouch.  Shook the thing aggressively (as per directions), pushed the button, as per directions.  No lively tail.  No nothing.  Did it all over again.  It reacted for 5 seconds and went dead.  I replaced the batteries with others, thinking maybe they were the problem - but I had just purchased them.  Nope.  Nothing.  I am not sure if the button is supposed to stay depressed but I tried everything.  I gave up and have not tried the other one.  I will say that the ball inside that holds the batteries is very rigid.  My springer has very strong jaws. He grabbed the thing, and I was afraid he would crack it open - even though it was in the furry pouch.  I may try again, but not too soon.

1,one thing really like collar pretty much plug play deal instruction easy follow get confuse correct dog purely human error part fault collar training remote zero issue two rambunctious dog one three yearold labborder collie mix one yearold golden retriever collar work wonderfully golden retriever stop obnoxious behavior rarely ever need remind take collar every night go kennel zero reason keep also clean prong inspect neck make sure nt sore burn ill effect people notice far absolutely nothing cause concern collar work labborder collie however fault collar manufacturer seller poor boy rescue puppy severely traumatized nt sure happen know extremely sensitive thing take several week earn trust first bring home nt like feel new collar correct beep scar tend bark like crazy fiend whenever husband come home work hit beep function nt faze use vibration low setting terrify try put collar back next morning upset urinate floor would recommend use collar dog traumatize interesting fact two boy correct young dog old dog responds also collar beep immediately stop cause correction guess technically collar work collar well make hold charge couple day easy use provide gentle correction great buy collar make plastic easily change nt happen like plastic,"One of the things that I really like about this collar is that it was pretty much a plug & play deal.  The instructions were easy to follow and other than getting confused about correcting which dog when (purely a human error on our part...no fault of the collar or the training remote), we have had zero issues with it.

We have 2 very rambunctious dogs; one is a 3 year-old lab/border collie mix and the other is a one year-old golden retriever.  The collar works wonderfully on the golden retriever.  He has stopped some of his more obnoxious behaviors and rarely ever needs reminding.  I take the collar off of him every night when he goes into his kennel because there is zero reason to keep it on him.  I also clean the prongs off and inspect his neck to make sure he doesn't have any sores, burns, or other ill effects other people have noticed.  So far....absolutely nothing to cause any concern.

The collar does not work on our lab/border collie; however, that is not the fault of the collar's manufacturer or the seller.  Our poor boy was rescued as a puppy and was severely traumatized.  We aren't sure what all happened to him; we just know that he is extremely sensitive to some things and it took several weeks to earn his trust when we first brought him home.

He didn't like the feel of the new collar and then when he was corrected (just a beep) it scared him.  He tends to bark like a crazy fiend whenever my husband comes home from work, and I hit the beep function and it didn't faze him, so I used the vibration on a low setting and that terrified him.  When I tried to put the collar back on him the next morning, he was so upset that he urinated all over the floor.  So....I would not recommend you use the collar on a dog that has been traumatized.

An interesting fact for my two boys is that when I correct the younger dog, the older dog responds also.  If the collar beeps, they both immediately stop what they were doing that caused the correction.  So, I guess technically the collar works for both!

The collar is well made, holds a charge for a couple of days, is easy to use, and provides gentle correction.  All in all a great buy. The collar itself is made of plastic; but that is easily changed out if you don't happen to like plastic."

I went to their website and too noticed the difference in the pictures between all the cuts and the 3rd wafer cut looked green and very thin. So I ordered it expecting the best. I received a box today, the HAY was really thick  and lots of dead brown weeds. I dug further down in the box and all of the Hay has brown weeds and the hay is sooo dry it barely has any smell. I want a refund and I will not be ordering again. DO NOT BUY THIS HAY!!! The pictures are false advertisement. I have attached images to back up my claim."

She really likes to sit on the second level (she jumps straight up... The stairs aren't helpful). She tried getting in the little cubby once but doesn't fit. She refused to try the hammock and only got in the basket once. She hasn't figured out a way to get to the third level but seems to enjoy the view when I put her up there. It is the perfect height for me to brush her without having to bend down. I really believe that if she had this as a kitten she would have climbed all over it and would still enjoy it all as an adult cat. Knowing what I know now, I would likely still make this purchase. I do wish that the hole was on the third level because it is easy for her to jump from the floor to the second level but then she doesn't have a way to get higher. It was pretty easy to put together but the box was heavy."

They do recommend a better litter that clumps better and stays clumped, and we got that as well, and love it!  And it doesn't smell because it stays clumped together, which was better than the old backing soda litter.  The cleaning is better than the old litter box, which broke every year, just about when the warranty was up.

The  bags that come with it and that we will be buying, will let you change it 2X a week, for a year for only 14 dollars.... The entire family is happy with the new box, it cleans better, the new litter truly stays clumped and it is easier to use.

The husband, not knowing it was there, accidentally hit it with his foot and set the dormant mouse into a 3 second run which ended just under our refrigerator. He bent down to get it and he bumped it which made it travel deep under the refrigerator. He went again to grab it but it got stuck and he pulled its tail off and it took off again for another 3 second run. The he got a yard stick to reach it but every time he would touch it, it would start up again and run like a real mouse would. The cat sat and watched him battle for this stupid, hexbug mouse for almost 10 minutes until it was finally captured and tossed in the garbage. What an event. It does not run on carpet.

Two of the three cats complained for the majority of a 1000 mile trip. The purchase was for a vacation trip, for around 1200 miles one way. The two complainers were MUCH better, in fact one really had very little to say. The other, still had some loud meows, but much less and not for the entire trip. It worked well to seat buckle them onto the rear seat; easy for them to see/comfort each other and see us.
Great idea that worked well for my cats.
My complaint would be that the material is heavy, making it warm for the cat. It would be nice to have a ventilated panel. I do like the sturdiness of the material, though."

The light is not in a hood, and has good ventilation.  The light flips on and off throughout the day and is very annoying.  For the price I payed for this unit I think the quality control is poor.  The light obviously needs a better heat-sink.

FYI I do not have this light in a hood or air restricted spot.  It is open to ambient room temps of 65*F.

UPDATE (10/30/2015):  I contacted the manufacturer about this product, and after waiting several weeks to process an RMA I received a replacement unit.  The second unit would not program correctly, the overlay/sticker piece on the remote fell off constantly.  I have to use a manual timer to use this light to keep my tank lit till I found a replacement light.  The second light soon after did the same thing as the first one and started turning on and off randomly.

I threw this piece of junk in the trash and will not buy another ecoxotic product.  I wasted a good amount of money and time on a product that has poor quality controls and R&D. I will not even bother with a 2nd RMA on this item, its not worth the time."

My puppy had leg surgery and we got this to keep him from walking around, but still feel a part of what were doing. He is a 9.5 lb Pomchi and we got a large because the reviews said it runs small. It fit him well but there was definitely a little gapping behind his back. I wish there was a Velcro or elastic band across the belly to help hold him up when he gets sleepy so he doesnt get uncomfortable. He is in it a little wonky in the photo because of the cast and so we had to position his bottom more to one side. Also, because it was a little too deep, the tail hole wasn't in the right place for him comfortably so he just liked it stuck out of his leg hole. I do like that the straps are long enough to be worn straight or cross backed for more support and stability. Overall, nice carrier!"

Of course my Doberman could care less what it looks like, as long as it is large, which it is. Soft, which it is too. And smells good.
He has been laying on it for a week now, so I'm sure it does.
When you keep it full size, the filling gets a little thin, so I shake it down to fill about 2/3 and then fold the other 1/3 underneath. That way
it is thick enough for my dog not to feel the floor underneath."

I have even dug through the box towards the middle or bottom, hoping the quality gets better, but with every grab, there are large quantities of FOXTAILS in them. There have been a plethora of FOXTAILS in BOTH boxes that I received. I am starting to question if I should switch to organic hay or a new company entirely. Despite my rabbits being used to this hay, I am debating about switching as the FOXTAILS are embedding themselves into my dogs, my clothes, blankets, towels, etc.. And yes I do wash my rabbit's stuff (as they have blankets/towel in their house) separately from ours. Please discontinue, discount or do something about this problem!!! I cannot keep ordering boxes that I know will do damage to my other animals and goods around us.

Foxtails (Setaria spp.) are invasive weeds in pastures and hayfields. The competitive growth of foxtails with pasture species causes stand thinning and reductions in hay yields. Foxtails may be grazed in spring prior to inflorescence development. However, the production of seedheads is concerning in summer due to the sharp awns that can damage the gums of livestock. Hayfield growers are also concerned about the economic impact of foxtails on yield and hay quality."

This bed is not much thicker than the two inch foam.  It definitely does not look like the photos.  The inside filling is not only made up of materials that your pet should never sleep on, but it is also sectioned off into 4 rolls.  This makes the bed wavy and lumpy.

The other dog, her playmate is a Bernese Mountain Mastiff. During puppy play the screws came out of the metal attachment. I'm happy that I purchased two Kurgo harnesses."

I switched to another brand,  a collar but it will take time to get back to normal around here. Its a shame that a product that worked so well for 6 ,8  years or more failed all of us living here. The product is made in France, if others are having a similar problem the owners of the company MERIAL will be taking a heavy hit in there pocket book. I won't take the chance that there problem is resolved and personally I wish someone would bring a civil Class Action law suit against them"

Not even when I mixed just a few kibbles into her regular food.  She actually didn't eat anything for over 24 hours.  She's never rejected any type of dry food before.

She's been on a few other varieties of food (kitten, and then a few types of adult food) before with no issues transitioning.  Her most recent food is the Science Diet Ideal Balance, which seems to have recently disappeared from stores, and I can't even find it on Amazon anymore.  My vet recommended the Wellness brand, so we may try another variety, but this one is being returned.  I've got to find something else before my stash of her old food runs out."

Just awful. The shelves/levels didn't fit correctly. I had to pull out metal wire and do a heavy duty version of twist-tying the levels to the bars on the side to keep them in place. The top slid around on the tank badly and the cat could easily push the top right off. This is not a well-designed product. If you buy it, be sure to have a backup plan in case you want to return it. I had no backup plan so I just had to make it work, but I really feel it was a total waste of money and a couple weeks later, we gave it away to someone else because we were not happy with it."

Was on the ""todo list"" until it stopped working completely.  Due to details on a different website I removed the pump and carefully pulled the flow control arm until that end of the pump came off, then removed the cover from the impellor and thoroughly cleaned everything.  Result - back to day one performance.  The filters protect the pets, but not the motor which has poor filtering and gets well clogged up regardless of whether you have hard or soft water - unless of course your pets never make the water dirty or drool in it!

Clean the pump impellor as well as the casing and this will serve you very well, for a long time."

Went to the kitchen, got a drink and heard her on it. Came back and it was shredded. This might work if you dog is afraid of it's own shadow."

Have you ever used a shampoo on your dog and afterwards they just smelled like wet dog? These are probably the most irritating dog products that there are. I just ask two things of a dog shampoo for Lion: fo tirst, that the shampoo does not dry out his skin and second, that he not smell like wet dog. This managed to succeed on both counts. Plus it was really easy to apply and to rinse off. I had good success using the fine density on one of my two cats (the other one will probably kill anyone who ever tries to give him a bath). So this line of products is riding pretty high in my books. I need to add that I got both of the shampoos as products to review, but if anyone thinks that that would influence my review should check my reviews. If a product deserves a poor review I don't hesitate to give it a two or one star review. But the other side of getting items to review is that you get to know products that you might otherwise not get exposed to. I often get to know products that then become things I use on an ongoing basis. I think this will very probably be one of them."

It was able to hold the temperature steady once I set the desired temperature. Easy!
And, completely submersible.

I'm disappointed that it stopped working after less than 2 years.
When I plug it in, the display LEDs flash briefly then they turn off. No heat.
There is no sign of damage, so I assume this is some sort of electronic part failure.
Others have reported similar problems.

The manufacturer's warranty is only 6 months.

Had to quickly buy a replacement heater to keep our turtle warm.

Feb 21, 2013 update: response from Finnex:
  Hello Wayne,
  We are sorry to hear about the problem with our heater. It sounds like you got a bad sensor, which is
  unrepairable. Our heaters carry a 6 months limited warranty against manufacture defects.
  We are sorry to advise you the heater is no longer under warranty."

One of my boxers was having stool issues and vomiting often (sensitive stomach). We could not keep weight on her AT ALL! We fed her a large amount of different brand dog food and she still looked starved. We went to a pet store one day and asked for recommendations. They recommended this product (we get the salmon flavor to help her skin as well). We couldn't be happier! No more throwing up. No more bad poo's, and now it looks like we feed her! She (like many boxers) is still on the skinny side but not just ribs and hip bones sticking out. Since this product is expensive we feed our other 2 dogs purina pro plan (which works for them). Some reviews mention the dogs having stinky gas... BOTH my boxers stink us out of the house and the terrier doesn't fart at all (maybe a breed thing?). But, they are on 2 different dog foods (so not necessarily just the dog food causing the stink). Worth the money!!"

Less than 24 hours after putting this down for the dogs, I noticed a collection of blood on the toy and bleeding gums on my dog (not horrible, just a couple small scratches).  What bothers me the most is the fact that the toy is this sharp and cut up my dog's gums after they had it less than 24 hours.  I have 2 dobermans and 2 old English Bulldogges.  One of my dobermans is the one with the cut gums. Definitely not a good one for power chewers."

Diabetic food prescribed by Vet did not work; I scrambled to find something that did - this did (to my surprise). He is back to his normal weight (85 lbs vs. 64 lbs) and has a very good coat now. He remains on insulin along with this food and continues to do great. This seems to be a solid food - if it works for him i suspect it will work just as well for non-diabetic dogs.

I used to use this for my large Jack Dempsey which I did notice a color change with, still waiting for my Pacus to get more color.  Reason I bought it from Amazon instead of the fish store is they were closed over the weekend and Prime would allow me to get it faster.  It was not cheaper, as it should be, it was one dollar more and I was charged tax.  I try to support local business especially when you lose out buying from Amazon but the fish needed food."

I took her to the vet and everything I thought was wrong with her was fine.  They suggested trying another food.  Within a few days on different food her poop was completely normal.  I try to feed her the best quality food- and this is definitely not it.  I feel awful that I even put her health in jeopardy to begin with from a well known, trusted company.  Its so awful that you cant trust any company or brand these days.  I read somewhere that they put lead in their food and its made in China, which has different regulations. I have never left a bad review on Amazon- so the fact that I am making sure to notify others should say how important it is NOT TO BUY THIS!"

I set it to the first setting, which adjusts the level of electricity based on whether the dog continues to bark. For the first hour it was on, his reaction after barking was an immediate yelp followed by quiet. Yeah! Wonderful! Than some friends came over. As soon as they knocked on the door, he let out two barks before suddenly switching to screams of pain and panic. With each scream he was zapped again, sending him into an absolute panic. We finally caught him after he ran all over the house petrified and peeing from fear and pain. After removing the collar, he hid in the far back of his kennel for about an hour trembling, and would NOT come out."

After all, cats are known to be persnickety, and what one cat likes, another is bound to not like, just because they are cats and that is how they roll. My cats, fortunately, all happen to like this collection of cat food, I suspect primarily because of the texture. They don't like loaf style food, only chunky bits.  The flavor doesn't even seem to matter as long as the texture is there. So for what it is worth, my kitties enjoy this, and the Amazon price is reasonable, particularly with the subscription service. Amazon service is always first rate, and I've never received a dented can. The boxes are packaged with an extra layer of cardboard to ensure their safe arrival.

My husband and I purchased two of these (very expensive) units, with hoods, and the reusable tray, and the crystal litter. At first, everything seemed fine. The cats were using it with no problems, there wasn't much of a smell, and the machine did scrape the tray after the box was used. We have two cats, but they are separate. So each cat has their own litter box.

To save money, we chose the reusable trays. After about a week, the smell was noticeable. By the end of the month, the smell had already been awful for several days. But we tried to stick it out since the litter is supposed to last 30 days and is expensive. What we didn't realize is that cleaning the reusable tray would be an experience to make even the strongest stomachs turn. When you open the unit and remove the tray, immediately you are gagging. Cleaning it is unbearable. The urine and feces caked on to the tray. It took almost 3 hours to clean both litter trays and sanitize them and refill with litter. My husband scooped out the litter box twice a week (which defeats the purpose of scoop free...) My husband literally had to wash his clothes immediately after cleaning the litter boxes, he reeked like cat urine and the whole house smelled (litter boxes are in the basement).

After the first month, we decided to use 1.5 bags in each box, to help absorb more urine and the smell. Same problem. The third month, we tried using 1 bag on Day 1, and adding a bag on Day 15. Same problem. The fourth month, we gave in and switched to disposable trays, and we began scooping the box out daily. We also added additional litter on Day 15. Same problem, minus the caked on urine. It did save time to use the disposable trays. The fifth month, we started switching the trays out every 20 days. Same problem. The sixth month we didn't change anything. The seventh month we started changing the disposable trays every 15 days with daily scooping and adding additional litter. You get the idea...

Also, we have hardwood floors and stepping on those crystals is literally like stepping on a Lego, only disgusting because you don't know if the crystal has urine inside of it. I've actually had the crystals cut my feet open and cause me to bleed. And we have a litter tracking mat, too.

We have routinely been spending $60-80 per month on JUST cat litter, which is insane. We've had the boxes for about 10 months now, and we literally can't stand it anymore. We are switching back to regular litter boxes with regular clay. We used to scoop it daily and change the litter every month. We thought this would make our lives easier. It's only made things worse."

She had been diagnosed with Cushing's disease and her health began to decline in old age.

She was no longer able to go up stairs due to hip and back problems, but then her back legs began to splay because her paws no longer stood up straight on the floor.

We tried the rubber glove style slip-on booties, but they didn't help at all. I found these at a local dog boutique shop and paid over $60 for the set.

They have a substantial sole design and good structure. Upon putting them on the very first time, she could stand up on her own four feet without assistance. She regained her quality of life for her last two years thanks to these shoes.

It's been three years since she passed away, but now it's time for our new Standard Poodle Puppy to go out in public. We are buying another pair for him because we had such a great experience with these shoes before.

They are expensive, but no price can be placed on protecting our baby's paws from hot Atlanta pavement. While his needs are different from Kyra's, there is no better shoe available for any need.

They are well-constructed, with a quality Vibram sole. They are comfortable, with no rough edges to cause blisters, and a thick enough sole to go from hiking, to snow, to simply walking in the yard, without any concern for him stepping on our massive Fire Ant mounds, or getting burned by crossing the driveway."

I have a standard poodle who is very ""busy"".  I knew that the legs might be a little short, but I could always add a little to them, if necessary.

The front legs are a tiny bit short, and the rear legs are fine for him.  I will probably add a little banding to the legs, and will have a great snow suit for a price that doesn't break the bank.

My dog has been trying to tear it apart for 3 months shy of a year and it's still going strong. Nothing else compares. Tuffy's: puffys, my dog destroys them in 20 minutes. Tennis balls: he destroys those too, but he also hides them to destroy and eat later. He can't hide jolly ball, because it's big and pink! I don't have to worry about leaving him outside with it, because a) he doesn't seem to be able to destroy it, and b) if I'm not there throwing it for him, then he'd rather play with something that he can destroy, like sticks or the wood on the outdoor furniture (bad boy!) I also like the size and elasticity of the ball, because I can kick it like a soccer ball. If you are worried that it is too hard, it gets a little softer as you break it in, though that doesn't seem to have compromised its integrity one bit. For comparison my dog is an energetic, 2 year old, 50# mutt with a little staffordshire terrier in him. I am 100% satisfied with the jolly ball and I rarely am with consumer items (that's why I'm taking the time to write a review). If/when he eventually destroys this ball I will get him a new one."

When we got the seat we put it on the couch where he naps and put him in it. He smelled around for a bit, then curled up and took a nap. We moved it around to a few different places and wherever we put it he would get in and lay down. After about a week we were taking him out, so we put it in the back seat and hooked him in. He whined for the entire 20 minute drive. It was about 2 weeks before we were taking him in the car again, but this time was a 2 day road trip. He whined off and on for a couple of hours, but after that he was quiet. He looked out the window some, and slept some. But the miracle came when I had to leave him in the car by himself for a minute. Usually he loses his mind, tries to get out of the car with me, and cries really bad the entire time I'm gone. This time of course he couldn't get out. But he was completely calm. He didn't make a peep. He calmly watched me walk away. When I got back into the car he was equally as calm. It was AMAZING! I had my doubts after that first short trip, but after spending 2 days on the road with this seat I'm a believer. Before the seat he was always either in my lap or trying to sneak over to my lap while I was driving. Now he's safe in case of an accident, but also apparently feels more secure."

My little 4 yr old Shitz Shu girl has had seasonal allergies since I got her at 2 yrs old.  It got so bad her fur was falling out in patches and you can see the raw skin from all the scratching.  Not to mention to see & feel the suffering she was going through.  I believe in Holistic medicine for my family and it extends to my fur babies.  After searching & finding Dermacept on the net, I followed the dosage recommendations and gave her 1 full tablet for first 5 days and then taper down to 1/2 tablet after that.  Her symptoms were so severe that I kept her on full dosage for a month and slowly she got better.  If you read the web site, they also tell you that it may take a month or more to see results. Holistic medicine or supplements are not like conventional meds, it is a gradual process because it is basically assisting your body to heal itself.  Well, when I noticed that the scratching begin to slowly subside, I was so relieved and I have been using Dermacept ever since.  What I have learned since then is that you can technically stop giving the supplement when you no longer see grass growing during the coldest winter months, but you must start giving your pet the supplement at least a month in advance before the anticipation of spring plants growing (I had to learn the hard way).  This way it will save your little one a lot of unnecessary suffering. $35.00 for a 3 month supply (more if 1/2 dose) is a bargain especially if you compare it to vet bills and the really bad side effects of steroids. I now give Dermacept year round and will may even give it to my other pets as a maintenance vitamin since it is full of antioxidants."

My dogs hear the warning tone now and stop immediately.  I only have them wear them every other day and they still don't bark.  The beagle whimpers a little but what a change!  My neighbors really like the peace and quiet also!.  Great so far.

===UPDATE===
After less than a year, one of the collars short-circuited on our dog.  He was walking through the yard when it started shocking him.  When we ripped it off him, it shocked us!  Gave the dog first degree burns on his throat and severely traumatized him.  Took us a week to coax him back into his regular collar.  Ridiculous!  There should be a safety default to open the circuit instead of constantly shocking."

I wanted to keep the cats off of my ottoman but they can come up on it and walk past the can without being sprayed.  As soon as a person walks past the ottoman (not even on it mind you) it sprays!

I looked at this toy for about six weeks before ordering it because our little darling is a determined power chewer and can destroy ""indestructible"" toys in nothing flat.  I'm SO glad I finally ordered it!  Thanks to the Amazon community who -- once again -- helped me find a great product.  We've been using this toy now for about a month and it's still in great shape -- aside from being regularly soaked in saliva!  Our dog really, really, really loves this toy.  My husband gave it a funny name and plays with it using a funny voice, and as soon as our dog hears the toy name or special voice, he just goes crazy with excitement!  It's incredibly fun.  NOTE: If you have a young energetic dog like we do, work him up gradually and be alert to safety.  We recommend starting on grass or a soft carpet -- something a bit padded and with good traction.  We made the mistake of playing a few times on a hard wood floor and our hyper excited young little dog landed once or twice on his back.  After that he was afraid of the toy for a few days.  We started again gently keeping the toy trajectory low to the ground and playing only on grass and carpet.  We were also careful to avoid motions that would lead him to twist too much in the air before landing.  After a few days he was back to happy hyper excitement and leaping high in the air again like a crazy little daredevil.  After a month he is so skilled and coordinated that we don't worry about bad landings anymore.  His eye-object-mouth coordination has improved, he is better at catching (and releasing!) frizbees and balls, and we can see him paying attention to how he lands.  It has made a real difference in his coordination and balance.  It's a great toy for little dog athletes-- as good a discovery as the wonderful Chuck-it Glowball.  I can't say enough good things about it.  And tough?  No problems at all so far -- it's still in great shape.  My husband has taken to using the replacement teaser toy by hand as a quick fun break indoors when he is at his computer and out dog is with him. One other tip: try using an old coat and gloves the first couple weeks if you play outside.  Our dog got so excited he got a little careless with his teeth when were were taking it away from him, and he also wanted to bounce off of us at first as he lept up and down.  Wonderful, wonderful toy to exhaust and entertain your dog while entertaining but not exhausting yourself!"

Save yourself the hassle and just get a soft ecollar or a comfy cone."

The brown color matches well with dark wood furniture too, we have one in front of each end of our wall unit and it looks like these were made to be there.

4 stars only because both of the two i bought did not come with the hook on outside accessory/ball toy. i don't mind in the end though, they have plenty of toys but, If i had paid higher price, i would not be happy about not getting what is being advertised and what seems like some are getting but, other buyers like myself are not..

update: took a wet/damp papertowel to get hair off of top these and the paper towel turned reddish brown! same happen next two times. i would be a little cautious about buying these if you have a constant fabric/blanket licker. would watch when cats groom on it too for one of my kittens likes to groom himself on one of these and it usually gets material wet so i personally no longer allow him to groom himself on it to be safe.

update again: one by one all three of these ended up being thrown in trash over 3 mths ago (currently 6/8), i don't know what chemical/etc. scent is on these but, whatever it is, it enticed my cats to pee on each one of them. they have many loungers, toys, towers, scratchers and blankets and they have never peed on any of them, just the brown packaging paper and plastic bags on occassions! did really like these though, it is too bad cats thought they were for peeing on/in."

We purchased your product a few weeks ago. Since it's purchase and activation it continues to say not reporting. We have gone through all of the help documents and regardless of whether or not the product is in or outside, it is not reporting.
Currently, the lights indicate no GPS even though, according to the coverage maps on their site via Tmobile, we are located in a area with full 2g coverage. We purchased the tracker from amazon and are returning the as product is not reliable and does not work as advertised.

What is ridiculous is that in order to even know if the product will work you must sign up for service prior to even testing the tracker for reliability and accuracy. Additionally, the only way to contact support is via a pre-generated contact us email form that continues to recommend you to a place on the help blog and never actually responds. According to their website they cannot (will not) refund amounts of purchased plans once paid for and in order to discover whether or not the tracker works you must purchase the service plans!

The website is misleading with information it provides to the consumer and makes it really hard to understand your options with purchasing service.

I am very tech savvy and have worked with several other tracking devices (very successfully) and was hoping this would work to track my pet effectively and accurately, needless to say this product is not one I would recommend at all!

Additionally, customer service is horrible, they only communicate via email and even then do not seem to resolve the problems with applicable answers. They also takes days to respond!

If you value your money and do not want to lose it: DO NOT BUY"

This product is MUCH SAFER to use than the fuzzy polyester snuggle hut that is sold. I have 2 green cheek conures and they love this seagrass snuggle hut. One bird was slightly afraid to use it at first, but that same bird also never had experienced any sort of hide-away in his cage before this eitherand after leaving the product in the cage for a week the bird that was a little afraid of the hut at first has also warmed up to using it and now both of my green cheek conures easily fit in the snuggle hut and happily enjoy crawling into the snuggle hut for a nap or to chew on it a little. This particular sea grass snuggle hut isn't huge, and Im not sure if they sell a large version. So Im pretty sure any small/medium bird like budgies, conures, cockatiels, could fit in this product. This product is definitely not for a fully grown African Gray or Macaw unless they're small babies (and will eventually outgrow this hut). The only downside to this product that I can think of (and it still isn't an issue for me yet), is IF your bird chew this toy up, the toy has some structural wire holding its safe together, and at that point I wouldnt think the exposed wire is safe and you should simply throw out the used-up toy and get another.

Recommendation to other bird owners: This product COULD encourage some nesting behaviors, especially if you have two birds in the same cage. If you want to try to avoid that, then I still would highly recommend the product, but I just wouldnt cover it up with anything like a small towel, and I wouldnt put any bedding inside of the snuggle hut, and I wouldnt put the hut in a corner of the cage so that it feels like it has 3 walls around itthat way this snuggle hut hopefully seem like less of a nest and more of a great place to hide and snuggle and sleep. No promises though, a product like this could encourage any behavior in birds since they're all different. And no matter what, I still recommend any bird/parrot owner to try out this product. If it doesnt work out then worst case return it, or gift it, or sell it, or maybe try it out again later on to see if your birds opinion of the product has changed. Ill also reiterate that this bird hut is SAFE(er), but still not perfect and nothing really is perfect, as this snuggle hut is using natural sea grass instead of using the fuzzy polyester fibers on the alternative snuggle hut (which is NOT safe). As far as I know, no bird has died or become sick from this sea grass snuggle hut, and a VERY large specialty bird store near my house only sells this sea grass snuggle hut, and they always advise people to NOT buy the fuzzy polyester snuggle hut. The competitors polyester fuzzy snuggle hut has fibers that could *literally* KILL your bird if it tries to eat lots of the polyester fibers. Be warned...polyester fibers WILL get stuck in your birds gut and the bird will not be able to poop these fibers out (its especially bad for smaller/medium birds), and if your bird eats a lot of the polyester fibers (in the competitors product) then your bird could die from their gut getting clogged up by these fibers Birds eating the polyester fibers of the other snuggle hut HAVE ACTUALLY DIED and you don't want to be the person who killed your bird through good intentions and a simple and avoidable mistake. As with ANY toy...be sure you supervise your bird(s) with it to make sure they're not going to potentially harm themselves with it...especially before leaving the toy in your birds cage cage 24/7 when you're not around to watch all their actions.

To the other reviewers who rated this product lower than 5 stars:  I think this bird snuggle hut is amazing. Lets be real here...you should know what you're buying before you buy it, and you should also know the nature of birds in general; and I'll briefly speak to that. This same scenario applies when you buy any other bird product as well. To the folks lowering the rating on this item because their bird is scared of the item OR because their bird shredded it up....REALLY?...You're going to blame this type of product based on your birds personality?? EVERY BIRD HAS IT'S OWN UNIQUE PERSONALITY! Some are scared by the color red, some are scared by round objects with little holes in them, etc, etcSome birds love crunchy sounds and other birds hate crunchy sounds, etc. Why would you rate this product down because your bird is scared of it? I personally feel that if the product itself arrived as described and in good condition, then you got what you paid for. If your bird hated it, thats not really the products fault lol...You could probably buy 30 other totally different bird toys and your bird could hate any (or all) of them for any number of reasons... Also, this is a natural sea grass toy! Your bird might chew it up...but so what! ALL BIRDS love to chew and shred stuff up! (If you want to debate my choice of words ""all birds, then lets say MOST birds love to chew and shred). It's natural foraging for birds to explore with their beaks and play and shred this unit up. Again back to reality...you want to discredit this product because its a natural grass toy that your bird can play, sleep, and rest within and on top of, as well as chew it up and enjoy the product? If you wanted an indestructible bird product that lasts forever then buy them something hard and uncomfortable like plastic or potentially dangerous and cold and uncomfortable metal slabs (sarcasm)...I'm sure the plastic product will last a bit longer, and Im sure the indestructible yet overall crappy metal product will last unused forever but I doubt your bird will enjoy that as much as they might enjoy a snuggle hut like this particular sea grass product. Long story short, go into buying this product with the expectations that you might find yourself buying this same product in the near or distant future. But keep in mind that you'll find yourself buying it again because your bird loved having fun with it and you want your bird to be happy!

Good luck to all of my fellow avian owners and wishes of long and happy lives for all of our birds."

The color is great. There is a zipper opening at the top that is big enough for my hand, but not for my cat to get out. It allows me to pet her, which is great for calming her down. I can also use it to throw in a treat if needed. I give four stars, and not five, only because  my four month old kitten will likely grow out of it eventually. It's fine for now, but may not be later. She'd still likely fit, but I doubt it will be as comfortable. I wish this particular color came in the larger size."

In fact, I've purchased two other styles since this one. The metal swivel ring showed signs of rust after about 2 weeks. In the first week, my labrador pulled it out of the ground twice. by the 3rd week, the swivel ring didn't swivel very well. Before it was in use for even one month, the metal swivel had broken off entirely and it had been pulled out of the ground at least 4 times.

This is NOT the worst tie out stake on the market, by far.... however, I won't be purchasing it again and am contemplating steering clear of all Pet Champion products as a result of my use of this one.

Pros: If you use a mallet/hammer to stake it into the ground, the main pole is much sturdier than comparable models (others bend after a few hits; this one did not ""give"").

Cons: Poor overall quality; doesn't last."

it is fairly light for a coat.  if it were a human garment, i would call it a medium weight jacket rather than a coat.

For both dogs I tested, the mother was a known breed; only the father was in question. Wisdom Panel did find the mother's breed in the sample, but at a tiny percentage; the rest of the breeds they included were simply crazy. The thing I find most unbelievable is that the results include uncommon breeds like Shar-pei, Chow, and Swiss Shepherd in the mix: these types of breeds are not exactly prevalent in most areas, nor are they running the streets to mate with other dogs on the fly!

DNA testing is entertaining, but I don't think the underlying data they use is complete enough to give meaningful results yet. I bought this for fifty bucks so I don't feel too ripped off.  Two stars for the test itself: easy to use, processed in about 3 weeks, and online reports are fine. The photo below is my half-Border-Collie that they say is mostly Dalmatian!"

I'd estimate they've eaten a third of it in five weeks - probably time to throw it out.

It looks like it should be healthy and many cats like it but mine don't. Maybe I just got a bad bag? They'll eat Meow Mix and Iams with no problem. That's mainly what they've been eating the last few weeks plus canned food. Although, their all-time favorite is Call of The Wild. I'll probably get that next time since I know they will eat it."

I used this product right after adding Seachem Prime and found out that I pretty much have been WASTING this product. This is information posted by Tetra to an aquarium forum:

First, ideally you should set up the tank, and let
it run at least 24 hours, then, shortly before you head off to the store
for your first fish, add TSS to the tank. Within two hours, you should
add the fish. Our normal recommendation is to add one small fish per
ten gallons of water. However, you CAN fully stock the tank, you just
need to keep a close eye on it, and be sure to not complicate matters by
overfeeding as well. We recommend this method for African cichlid tanks
since it is best to fully stock such a tank from the beginning due to
territorial issues. For a novice fish-keeper, we'd recommend the one
small fish per ten gallons rule for the first two weeks. Within two
weeks, TSS should have fully cycled the tank and they can start slowly
adding more fish, one at a time.

In regards to ammonia products, yes, they kill TSS. Any type, whether a
chloramines remover or detoxifier, etc, anything that says it locks up
ammonia or removes ammonia. Do not add TSS for 24 hours after using
such a product, and do not add such a product for at least 7 days after
using TSS. The bacteria is housed in a special stabilized solution of
ammonia, so if you remove/lock up the ammonia, you remove all of the
food the bacteria require to live.

If you already have fish, and are having an ammonia issue, it is best to
get the ammonia levels down to below 4.0. 4.0 and higher is just as
toxic to TSS as it is to fish. While 2.0 -3.5 PPM ammonia may harm some
of the TSS bacteria, it should still have some effect. You may want to
do a second dose several days after adding the first one, if you are not
seeing the results you want. Keep in mind, these are bacteria, not a
chemical, so results are slow to see. Give the product at least 5-7
days.

Best temperature for TSS is between 40 and 80 degrees. Freezing and
extreme heat will destroy it. Refrigeration is okay, but not necessary.

You can test the water any time, but really, you should probably wait at
least 48 hours. We expect TSS to start slowly seeding the tank, and
making a difference in about that time. You have to have some ammonia
occur in the tank to provide the cycle needed, so it will usually create
levels or reduce levels to around 1.0-1.5 ppm, and they should stay
there for a week to 14 days, and then come down. Sorry, these levels
would be for both ammonia and nitrite. These are considered stress, but
not toxic, levels, and should not cause any long term damage to the
fish.

We recommend waiting two weeks before a water change. Of course, if for
some reason, the levels go up to a high level again, we would recommend
a change at that point, and another dose. Usually, the hobbyist has
done something wrong the first time, in such cases.

Nope, bacteria should not affect the pH.

Hmmm....be sure the levels are not already toxic, shake the container
thoroughly, be sure to add the right dosage, do not use an ammonia
detoxifying product, and be patient. It won't give you zero readings in
an hour, like some folks think. By the way, carbon does not affect it
but uv lights do...we get those questions too. :-) And just an
interesting point...the large aquariums, such as the Georgia Aquarium,
and the Shedd Aquarium, as well as huge research labs in this country
and other countries, also use TSS as well as the saltwater version Bio
Spira.

If I have not addressed all of your questions, please let me know.

Regards,

Tetra Care"

Design could be greatly improved if the four rubber side feet were adjustable with a screw like many gates on the market.

We used felt chair pads to make up the extra space between the side feet and the wall.

0,cat tree horrible poor quality fuzzy fabric staple particle board know could make good one also come screw assemble instruction say typo note one please confiem part get two plesae follow digit tp build cat firniture step step buyer beware return refund,"This cat tree is HORRIBLE.  It's poor quality, just some fuzzy fabric stapled to particle board.  If i had know, I could've made a better one myself.  It also did NOT come with screws to assemble it.
The instructions say (WITH these typos):

""NOTE:
1) please confiem all the parts when you get it.
2) plesae follows the digits tp build up the cat firniture step by step.""

BUYER BEWARE.  I'll be returning for a refund.  :("
