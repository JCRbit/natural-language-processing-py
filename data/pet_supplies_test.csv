Excellent heater. Two of these have heated a 200 gallon tank to a constant 82 degrees with no problem.  I like having the temp controller away from the actual heater. It makes it so much easier for fine tuning the temps without getting wet or having to remove them first.  Highly recommended and will buy again when needed.  Been using for two months and no probs so far.,1
"Do not waste you money on this piece of junk!

Cons:
1) Jams way too easily
2) Litter tray is way too shallow
3) Need a guard so that pee doesn't seep through as the cat pees
4) Need a guard in the back so that the litter doesn't leak out of the back of the box
5) Motor needs more power

The very first automatic Littermaid litter box that was a LM900 worked great and lasted about three years, was quiet and hardly ever seemed to have any problems.  After the LM 900 broke and Littermaid wasn't making it anymore, I stupidly bought the LM9000MB and have had nothing but problems with them.  They need to put a guard up in the back of the box because one of my cats likes to dig and he seems to manage to push the litter out of the back of the box.  The other cat pees a lot and apparently the clumps are too large for the rake to push them plus the pee seeps through the rake into the back of the box and I have to take the box apart every couple of days to wash the box and rake which is a huge hassle with the cover attachment.  The biggest issue is the machine jams so easily and it will jam mid way through it's cycle with either stopping in the middle of the box or in the upright position leaving the receptical open.  I thought the idea of an automatic litter box was I wouldn't have to scoop or deal with the box except once a month to clean the box and rake.  I am basically going to have to throw out this current automatic litter box because I basically am scooping the box 2-3 times a day now because the darn thing jams so easily!!",0
"This is a pretty good cot, but alot of the time, the tent part falls off and doesn't do too well in wind or rain. A person would be much better off with a dog igloo and a dog house.",0
Front line does not work on my dog at all. Had to try something else,0
Fits well and good quality.,1
Did not like this system.  Their poop kept getting clogged in the sifting grid and made for nasty clean-ups.,0
"Our St. Bernard had very large paws, and we attempted to use it on him in the winter time.  It was snowy and icy, and I can't say that the Paw Wax Protector worked for our Saint Bernard.  It might work very well in a warmer climate or at least one not as severely cold as we had that year.",0
"This is pure ANIMAL CRUELTY! Forcing a natural meat eater a vegan diet it NEVER okay, if you want a vegan pet, get an animal that's a herbivore, not a carnivore animals, you're just completely taking away the natural diet of a cat, also, cats need taurine to survive, and taurine can ONLY be found in meat! Everyone who buys this is an animal abuser!",0
"My dogs like to chew this bone, but when it's wet from chewing, it smells AWFUL. It smells like it was dipped in rotting food leakage. I hate to be graphic, but it's bad. I have it 2 stars because my dogs do like to chew it, but I've had to take it away as the smell was unbearable.",0
I tried this stuff on all four of my Yorkies and it did not do anything!  What a joke!,0
I have a 70lb German Shepherd/whippet mix and she has a deep chest.  I always have a hard time finding coats that will fit her chest but XL was perfect.  I still have some room if she packs on a few pounds.  I also love that its waterproof and reflective.,1
This came without the washer and nut to screw onto the post so it is useless. I tried to have another one sent but it also is missing the same parts. I have one of these food and water cups that I bought in town and it works really well so I wanted to get more so the item is good but the seller has totally messed it up.,0
"great working product, quick shipping and great service ! Thx",1
"This is the third LItterMaid that I have purchased, and this one I got in February and it stopped working about a month ago. The cleaning arm is stuck in the ""dump"" position and won't move. I'm very disappointed as this product was only able to returned for one month after purchase. For almost $100, this is very sad.",0
Bearded dragon loved it,1
Too many big chunks.  These are better when they are small.,0
"It has worked great even with these cold temperatures, I had it froze shut once but it was -20 and the insert was in overnight, when i took the insert out i was able to push it out and it swang back. I wiped the ice off the brushes and it has not done this again even with these cold temps. There is NO draft that comes in, heat loss is not to worry about we have never felt a breeze of even cold near the door.  Great product. Thanks",1
"I wasn't sure if it would live up to its claims, but, it really seems to work well in my three cat household.",1
I made sure dimensions would fit my dog before ordering. This XL did not come close to fitting my dog.  Her legs would break if they fit through the sleeves.  My most disappointing purchase from Amazon.,0
"They reason why I bought because I have a The same cd but in Salsa,MerenguenY Cumbias. The cd is really good.",1
Did suprisingly well growing low tech plants,1
"My puppies tore the foam bottom of this bed open in less than two days.  The problem is that the faux sheepskin cover just covers the side and top portions of the foam core.  The bottom is completely exposed and therefore turns into a chew toy for my two border collie puppies.  Also, because the foam bottom is bare to the ground, it will absorb water like a sponge.  I haven't had a problem with another dog bed that I bought that is completely covered.  The puppies can't get into it and its made of a higher quality material.  My recommendation is to buy a completely covered bed with a zipper that you can unzip and wash.",0
"Flimsy lids made of cheap plastic wouldn't last IF they fit the small cat cans.  I even wrote to Purina and they sent me the smaller version for the individual cat cans which are a two in one.  Didn't work.

I store my unsed cans in a reusable Ziplock bag for freshness and NO ODOR.",0
Works great on my cats!,1
Unfortunately these filters are the only ones to fit this pump and they are cheaply made the white foam part is unevenly cut in all the sides so a lot of dirt poop escapes back into your tank. Also the size varies from filter to filter in the same package so one might fit just fine while others fall off and need constant adjusting. But it is the only filter to fit this pump and I love this little pump so I guess I'm gonna be buying this them again,0
Keep these in both vehicles so we always have a bowl to feed or water our dog.,1
"The lavender smell is amazing; however when I received this item, the bottle cap was opened and most of the liquid poured out during the shipment.",0
Excellent product!  All five of my cats love it.  It's hard to find US sourced and manufactured pet food. I've been buying it for several years and have never been disappointed.. I highly recommend Paul Newman Organics.,1
Just received it in the mail today attempted to cut the nails of my 25 lb dog and it made him cry because it wasn't sharp enough. I figured maybe it's just for big dogs so I tried it on my 80 lb dog and it literally just scraped his nails off.,0
Cats loved it at first..then not so much.  They did finish this bag along with the salmon flavor which they liked better.  To bad..the ingredients are good and I cannot find this in the stores.  I may wait awhile and try this on them again.,1
It came quickly and my chiwennie seems to like it. Hopefully it lasts a while.,1
"Works very well around the eye area, it helps clear the stains as well.",1
Good product my dog didn't go for it though but enjoyed laying on it.,1
My dog loves these salmon treats. We did by some breathe treats too because these do cause some halitosis.,1
very pleased with this bedding!!! It is really pretty in the cage as well.,1
"The idea is really good and helpful! The only problem are the cuffs which are too small! My poor cat couldn't move and felt like in a straight jacket! Luckily I'm able to sew an I removed the cuffs at the legs. The neckband is too small too but this I didn't want to remove because I know my cat and she would be able to get out of the body without neckband! So I just made 2 cuts in the neckband and now it fits perfect! My little darling is now able to walk, eat and play but unable to clean her wound!
Another problem was that the hole for the tail is only for the tail! I had to make it bigger that she was able to use her litter box
The first 2 fotos are before sewing - she felt horrible
The 3rd foto is after sewing - she is happy again
The 4th foto shows my changings at the hole for the tail",0
"I've tried several versions of kitty litter mats and this is the most effective one I've used.  It really does trap most of the clay litter my cats carry in their paws after using their box.  It's large enough to move around for optimal coverage, and is sturdy and well made. I would recommend this product.",1
"Use this to put treats in and when she goes potty like she's suppose to, she gets her treat immediately",1
Finally got around to using this and it is awesome! The lines in the design make it easy to cut and measure. My cats seem to like it and it looks nice.,1
Great tool to help train your dog.,1
Dogs and I are having a great time with it!,1
"We  have a jack russell basset hound mix and she just loves these - we cut them in half and she devours one half in approx 20 mins leaving a smile on her face.  I do wish they were a bit cheaper as we use to be able to find them in the store at a much lower price.  For our pup, who is an avid chewer, a very good choice.",1
"Soft, comfy, easy to use - my pup got right in - so glad it's been cleared for airline use so I don't need to worry. Looking forward to taking our pooch on a trip!",1
"It was way smaller than expected and my kittens hated stepping on it so they would jump over it, which defeated the purpose of having it in the first place.",0
Great,1
Soft and warm for your dog.  Price is right.  Not for the heavy chewer.,1
A must have for a cichlid tank. Great item.,1
"There Way To Big, Dogs Are Not Happy Wearing Them, They Dont Keep the Male Covered",0
This is an amazing grooming tool have two long haired cats and they love it too buy one they are amazing,1
Wish there were more in the package,1
Broke the first day ,0
Only one my cats  use consistently,1
As described.  It was actually smaller than what I expected.  Works great!,1
"Only worked for a couple weeks. Then even though the spray feature still worked, my dog got used to it and just doesn't care if she gets sprayed! Very annoying since we have tried many things to get her to stop her literally CONSTANT barking!!!!!! Very displeased that it does not stop my dog from all the extremely annoying nonstop barking!!!!",0
Wow! My keets can't get enough of these!! Great training tool.,1
I bought it for a friend. She loves it.,1
HELPS TO ENHANCE PLANT GROWTH. GREAT STUFF,1
"This stuff works better than Nature's Miracle. It really gets rid of cat urine. My cats developed a bad habit of pooping on the bathroom floor because I've been trying to toilet train them and they will not poop over their own pee. After using this product to clean up the toilet and their toilet seat, they are more keen to going in the actual toilet.  I love how this stuff also smells like minty bubble gum. I wonder if it has any relations to the brand being called Bubba, like bubble gum?",1
dog destroyed this in 5 minutes.,0
"literally, haha, but the cats love it and it's stable enough for their size My boy cat is 7 pounds, my girl cat comes in at 10 pounds. They play, sleep and peer out the window on this tower and happily wile away hours that might be spent pestering me instead.
The tower is very easy to assemble and is pretty easy on the eyes considering it's cat furniture. So it does rock a little bit. I could remedy this if i didn't have an apartment with radiant heat coming from floor radiators thus making it impossible to get the tower to sit flush against a wall.
All in all, it was a great purchase. They even play with the ball on a string ( I tied it back on after they pulled it off the first time and it's remained since).",1
"need to change filters very often, broke after only a few months of owning it. had to buy another because i already had filters left from the first that broke....not impressed",0
Does not appear to be any catnip in toys or poor quality.,0
"My door flaps seal up well. I installed it into a new door on saw horses before I hung it. I would say it's definitely a two man job, at least doing it that way. The pet door frame is just slightly racked on one corner where the bolt wouldn't pull tight, but no weather gets through. My friend said one of the bolts looked bent to him when we were tightening it. I think he drilled the hole crooked. No matter. The cats love it. I left the flaps off for one day when the weather was still good, then added one flap. By the time the weather gets nasty, I'll add the second flap. The directions say to install it two inches above the height of the animal. I installed mine just a little low. The flaps push hard at the top, and the cats weren't too sure about it at first, but now they've learned to push through at the bottom of the flap. Recommendations: Be sure to cut the hole straight, drill the holes straight, and follow the instructions as to the installation height. Have someone help you if you're not handy with tools. You only get one chance when you install it.",1
This crate is bad. My 10 lb puppy escaped from it the first time she was in it. What a ripoff.,0
I have a 1 year old 75lb lab.  This worked great for her. Much better than the plastic cone from the vet and much more comfortable. I used a shoelace to tie and hold this onto her. It made taking this off and on very easy especially with the velcro strips. I went with just the large size. I had to use the last velcro strip but I think that was better than buying the next size up and dealing g with extra material.,1
I purchased this for my birds because the old one that I had broke and I had to replace it.,1
"The quality of this plant has really gone down (at least the ones sold by uxcell have). I've bought this plant several times over the past year and the last two times I have ordered it I have been disappointed, with the most recent order being the most disappointing of all. For starters, the plant doesn't look as realistic as it used to. Side by side with the ones I ordered a year ago the color is almost a bright neon green vs. the more realistic dark green it used to be. Each leaf is thinner/lower quality as well, almost transparent. Also, this recent batch of plants I ordered had all been sealed improperly and had wire exposed (which can rust and be toxic to fish). Two of the plants I ordered also arrived broken. The seller offered me a 70% refund, but overall I would not recommend buying this plant anymore. It really isn't what it used to be (I gave it a 5 star rating before).",0
Rapidly became one of Molly's top favorite toys.,1
Died quickly.,0
Great scratcher.  Sturdy and it satisfies the cats that want to use an incline scratcher as well as those that prefer a flat scratcher!,1
Super easy and smooth to use!,1
Very well crafted and is currently serving as the resting place for our furry family member. Was able to fit a tennis ball in there with him :),1
We have an older lab that loves to lay on our concrete porch. This thing looks presentable and has proven to be fairly durable. Our dog loves it and sleeps there on a daily basis.,1
"Packaging says 132lb max. Product description says max 132lbs.  Sticker on Flexi Vario says 55lb max.  What gives?
Last weigh in my dog was 55lbs, thinking she's packed on some more pounds since.  Gave it a test drive in the back yard.  A SMALL dog could jump through the 'Safety collar'.  That's the bad stuff.

Good stuff:  It feels well made.  The tape moved easily.  There's a dial on the inside of the handle, and while there's NO info on what that is on the instructions, we figured it out.  I thought it might be a tension adjustment, but no, it raises or lowers a plastic piece of the bottom of the handle so your pinky/bottom of your hand has a rest.  If you have giant hands or are wearing gloves you'd probably still be ok using this.  When not wearing gloves you could raise the 'rest'.  I found this comfortable and due to the ever growing dog my hands are taking a beating so this was welcome.

The test run didn't last long, but as far as introducing the dog to something new it went well.  I was able to get it on her.  However she didn't use it in a traditional manner.  She held the tape in her mouth and walked about.  When it was clear a test walk was not going to happen, I ended the test.

I am not sure that I will use this outside of fenced property 1. depends on dog walking with it the right way and 2. concerned about the weight capacity.",0
Have been using these drops for a month and I haven't seen any difference. These didn't work for my pet.,0
"Very disappointed.  I pictured our lab grabbing it in the middle and shaking it.  She loves to do that, but the elastic broke right away,  and tugging it caused the main seam to break, so it is useless.  I hate that they said it was a Tug Toy.  It is NOT a tug toy.  If they use it as a tug toy, it is not usable after that.  I don't think much thought was put into making this toy so it didn't fall apart.

I am returning it.  I refuse to support manufacturers who make ""cheap"", fall-apart toys.  I think they falsely advertised it ""Tug Toy""  just to appeal to dog owners who love their dogs.",0
Super cute and lightweight but it ripped along the zipper within 20 minutes of wearing it and then the pocket ripped about 20 minutes after that.,0
"Remember those little scissors they let you use in first grade?  These are worse.  I didn't expect much for 5 bucks, but I thought they would at least be sharp for a few months.  These would not even cut through the hair on the top of my little dogs head.  I have a pair of $25 scissors that need sharpened that cut better than these, so I know these aren't right.",0
It's well made and a great filter.  I'm new to this design so I'll watch it a couple of months and see how it works.,1
"Junk. This product had one of better reviews, but liquid spread too much. My small dog can party only twice, and we have to replace them.",0
My dog gets bored with the Kong even with treats stuffed in it.,0
"I had really high hopes because our puppy has a huge issue, but it did not work at all.  :(",0
"I actually bought 2 of these beds for our new puppy to fit inside her kennel. I figured with a puppy, it would be great to have two so that if she made a mess in one, I would have another to use while washing the first. The only advantage/Pro I have about these beds, are they are soft and cushy. My puppy (and the rest of our dogs) loved to lay in them.... and then the faux fur started coming out by the tuft-fulls. Being a puppy, she would dig in the bed and come up with mounds of fluffy fiber ""fur"" from the bed. I tried washing them both, several times, only to find my washer and dryer both, clogged with the fur. They do hold their cushiness after repeated washings, but even after repeated washings, I still have a ton of those fibers to clean out of the machines. It just never seems to stop and I don't think it will until the beds are bald. Its a shame as I really wanted to like these beds and they are soft and the dogs like them, but its not worth it to me when the puppy could eat that fur and potentially get into real trouble. If you find this review was helpful to you, please hit the ""yes"" button at the end of the review.",0
"This is a very good products especially if you I looking for something simple and easy to clean of course you can always go cheaper and buy sand but I recommend if you do by sand to lightly coat the bottom because sand tends to attract mites and other weird small jumping little gnat looking creatures to appear in your tank so this is definitely a safer alternative also there's no substrate to worry about. I would recommend though if you are buying this product two by two of them because when you take one out to clean it it needs to dry before it goes back in and all I needed was hot water and it cleaned very very well the first time. I've had this in my tank for a month now and just cleaned it in the picture below is how it looks now after I cleaned it I really didn't put much effort into it other than boiling hot water under the sink and rocks outside so it doesn't blow away and so the carpet stays flat I would also recommend getting a soft bristle to scrape unmentionables away so you're not wasting water no chemical is really needed to clean this and I spent $8 on this it was well worth it I just wish I had another one. The only issue I really have with this is that when it dries it does shrivel, thus the reason the rocks are on it while it dries",1
"This is the comb I rely on when when grooming my beautiful Wheaten Terrier, whose hair gets tangled & matted by merely looking at it.  I'd be in a real fix without this comb.  The blades can be reversed in this comb so it can be used either left or right handed.  I find it convenient to use both hands while combing, but in order to switch hands,  the blade needs to be reversed which is time consuming and a bit of a hassle.  I intend to buy a second comb and preset one for the left and the other for the right hand.",1
"This item arrived in a damaged state. Thought it could be fixed but was incorrect. Got a replacement from a ""local"" pet supply store, but it was cracked and leaked as well. It's a shame as this pump/filter can really move some water.

Update:
Went out and picked up some plastic epoxy, slowed the leak from a steady flow to a drip. I'm using the pump in a tote bin to catch any water that leaves the pump assembly. Keeps our turtle tank very clean. If only they weren't cracked/damaged as received.",0
Great quality!,1
"I did use the liquid with cotton swabs and wooden stick cotton swabs to clean their teeth, but even that has alcohol in it unnecessarily because other products don't use it. I have replaced this product's cleaner with PlaqueClenz that has zinc in it and I still use wooden stick cotton swabs to ""brush"" their teeth to get all of the sticky plaque off. I use a tarter scraper to remove any calcifications. This unit is in a box with all of the other products I've tried.",0
"Great harness, but our puppy grew much to big, had to buy next size larger.",1
The toy lasted 24 hours.  My dog ate the top 1/4 of the toy.,0
was as effective as tap water,0
Cheap toothbrush and my cat didn't like the tiny yucky toothpaste,0
Not as cool as I thought it would be. My two cats only play with it when I move it around.....,0
Had not removed a heavy algae problem I had. I definitely had removed the activated charcoal from the filter and zeolites also and saw no improvement.,0
"On the first day, my 6-week old puppy ripped the zipper apart on one of the sides.  I had to sew it shut.  It was cheaply manufactured. The playpen did arrive as promised. It was also packaged nicely.",0
This product is great. I used the shampoo on my German Shepard and his coat is so shiny!!! A little goes a long way...,1
"This is a very untraditional form of cat food--there are NO additives/fillers/supplements  it is essentially all protein.

Yes, that means all-natural and would seem to mimic what cats eat ""in the wild.""

Cats' nutritional needs DO vary though depending on life-stage and the condition of their health, and for that reason, I think this product should be marketed as a specialty food.

Your vet SHOULD be aware of the very real benefits of this kind of product (i.e. it is pure and the ingredients are ""human-grade"").

My cat's cardiologist recommended it.

But there ARE important factors to be considered.

Proceed with caution.

A high-protein diet is contra-indicated for renal problems, for instance.

Even if your cat is healthy now, if the breed is prone to certain diseases, etc., you'll want to do some research before feeding him or her TikiCat.

That being said, my cat did love it, and once he tasted it, it was all he wanted to eat.",1
Keeps tracking the litter around the house to a minimum.,1
"when used on a regular basis. Prevents digestive upsets for my dog.  I add to his food - he eats as usual. Have also used it for cats on antibiotic therapy, too, with good results (not on food - they know it's there.  Mix with water and syringe into mouth.)",1
"I have a Shiba Inu with a double coat and this thing was an absolute god send when she started blowing her coat this spring.  I had tried several other styles of brushes before this and nothing seemed to be working.  When my Furminator came in the mail I brushed her with it for about 10 minutes and I already had a mountain of fur, it was absolutely amazing",1
"works so good for our cats with bladder issues, it keeps the crystals under control and they do not have a hard time peeing.",1
we love it.  my cat sleeps in it all the time,1
My dog got ahold of this during the first use and ripped it to shreds. I had a kong groom brush previously that was indestructible which leads me to believe that his product was a fake.,0
Falls apart and I cannot return it! Do not buy this piece of garbage.,0
"my dog loves these cow balls. he played with them nonstop at a friend's house until we ordered these. would order again, but they are not black and white as depicted in the picture... they are brown and tan.",1
"The ball part is just fine, but the rope broke within a few minutes.",0
dog doesn't like it and it's kind of an eyesore,0
"Great product, glad to see there is a different strength for large cats, small cats now.  Cats are not flea free yet, but it was out of hand before I could afford to buy the treatments.  Maybe another month or two and we will be flea free since my 4 cats do not go outside.",1
Excellent,1
Didn't work.,0
I like.,1
"I installed this cat door and got cats who didn't want to stay inside, even though it was locked the cat was able to force its way out and escape. The lock isn't strong enough for a cat that isn't even full grown. Also this isn't thick enough to be installed in a standard door so there is a gap between the inner and outer parts.",0
"Looks very nice and has a tight fit. Our dog jumps up on it and it doesn't even budge. Very easy to install. Latch is a little hard to work, but probably has to be to keep younger kids from figuring out how to open it.",1
Great for our older dog who tires easily.  He doesn't really love the vest but we know it helps him.,1
"My GS loved it, but it didn't even last a week",0
I love this collar and have ordered one for all my dog's it is very sturdy and very nice,1
"My lab is 17 years old lab still able to ""occasionally"" trot down the driveway!
We love Glycolflex and we give it to her twice a day. She is crazy about it!",1
"I've been using this product for 2 years, since I found fleas on my dog summer. It is now a staple in my dogs diet. They like the taste and I feel better knowing his skin has some added protection during the flea season.",1
"this was the best LED collar that I have found. BUT, my dog is an outside/inside dog. He is an active dog and enjoys running around on our ranch.
The collar quit working today, (3/1/2018) It charged up but the on/off switch didn't activate the LED's.

I do not have a way to contact the seller. They stated the product was guaranteed..",0
"Some have reported this litter clumps like concrete.  My experience is that it ""clumps"" something like the consistency of wet sand.  Consequently I can never get the urine out of the box because it breaks into pieces too small to be picked up by scooper.  Also it does not seal out order.  It emits a different odor.  Only used half the box and it is going in the trash -- particularly after reading C. Harper's review as of May 21, 2014.  Our cat has been lethargic and engaging in some strange behaviors.  I attributed it to possible teething (5 month old kitten). but now I'm not so sure.",0
"Like a few other commenters, I admit to not changing these filters as often as I'm supposed to. We have very clean water where I'm from and I keep the fountain nice and clean so I don't find it all that necessary to change the filter more than once a month.

I did recently start mixing a dental additive into my cats' water to help prevent tooth decay. If you do this, don't forget to remove the filter or it will filter (duh) all of the good stuff out.",1
always the best,1
Great product !,1
"great design, sturdy, folds compactly",1
"I have a cat that freaks out when I sing (which I sing poorly but I love it), when one of he other pets gets scared, if he gets spooked or wants to dominate.  When I say freak out, I mean his eyes dialate, he climbs up our legs and bites us or he'll attack one of the other pets.

I put on the Thunder Shirt and within 15 minutes my daughter started wailing (which is another trigger for my cat to go crazy), and with that shirt on, he didn't attack anyone... He just looked at us like ""I feel like I should be doing something"".  He was still noticeably upset but he didn't act on it.

It was the first time EVER that he didn't loose his mind and get in a fight with one of the dogs or other cats.  It's definitely worth trying.  He's about 9lbs, a petite frame with medium hair and the small didn't fit but the medium was perfect.  it's not something he can wear 100% of the time because he can't jump in it but when he is inside the house, he'll be wearing it.",1
great,1
"It arrived ""smushed"" in the box and the top never has stayed up.  My 10 lb puppy ended up just sleeping on top of it.",0
Works as well as all the other tooth brushes purchased over the years.,1
"You have to squeeze the bottle to get the water to flow, but then it leaks. Frustrating when you have a hyper, thirsty dog",1
Works great!,1
"It fits perfectly on my 5 mo. French Bulldog, he is approximately 10-13lbs and it is a tight fit at the head but it does fit pretty well after that.",1

"Only dog toy that keeps my dog busy and is able to withstand his chomps.  If I do get a little tear, it usually is at the seam, which I can sew and the sew job stays strong.  Fabric is very strong.",1
I saw these on a deals website and figured I'd pick them up for my girlfriend's cats.  The cats loved the toys and my girlfriend was really happy too.  The variety of toys was very good and the shipping was fast.,1
I don't rate many things but I am so excited about this brush.  I have never used a brush that does this good of a job collecting hair and keeping it on the brush rather than floating all over the place.  I could not believe how much hair I brushed off these cats!  Was so easy to clean off too.  The cats have never liked being brushed before but they loved this brush.  Purred the whole time and are still following me around 10 minutes later for round two.  So happy!,1
"READ THIS FIRST!  I purchased this product a year or so ago,..  I was happy with it, so was my dog!  Of course dogs are dogs and after some time, I had to wash it.  After washing ONCE, it started coming apart, not where you'd expect, but directly in the center of the top!!  Called and sent email to Animal Planet and they gave NO customer service whatsoever!  They pawned it off to ""wherever you purchased it from"", and told me in plain words ""we don't manufacture product, if we did and you have a receipt, we can exchange it., but we don't actually make that dog bed so there is nothing we can do, sorry."" ""Try contacting the distributor.""  Like I know who that is?  I bought it at an ACE hardware store, they don't carry it anymore (wonder why) so they couldn't exchange it.  Cheap greedy company that allows to put their name on something and does absolutely ZERO to even try and help!  Seriously ""I know it has our tag that says animal planet, it's not our product"" ??? As a family with four dogs, two cats, a horse, two goats, four chickens and a member of 4-H, the lack of customer satisfaction will easily be spread!!  Too bad, as big as animal planet is, they can't stand behind one dog bed... 2 stars only because it was nice when I got it.",0

"I usually never have any problems with any product that I buy, nor am I very angry at the quality of the product.

What happened was that I brought my girlfriend the aquarium as a birthday gift because she loves the whole science behind aquaponics, lo and behold the aquarium was cracked in the corner and the grow bed bent like it was heated, the quality of the aquarium is just hidious. I felt so bad while opening the gift with her, made me feel like you can't buy anything cheaper than that!! And present it to the woman you love!!

This system looks like it was built in the garage and even garage built aquaponics systems are so much better than that!! I honestly don't know why and how they got all that funding in kickstarter!! Looks like all those people were fooled like me, in thinking they were actually getting a quality product!

I will not tell you to buy it or not! I will show you the pictures and you decide whether you want it or not!! BUT BE CAREFUL THE QUALITY IS HIDIOUS !!",0
"I had to return this (so I lost money) because it did not fit in our fountain. I felt like I ordered the correct pump. Just be sure you have the right pump for the right fountain....I do have an older fountain, like 2003.",0
"I bought the water dispenser and It works great. However, the food dispenser is poorly designed inside. Not enough slope on the bottom half, to encourage the food to slide down into the dish. I literally have to bend down and try to shake the food down and into the feeding bowl.",0
"In theory this is great.  Our 13 lb. Havanese kind of runs hot and cold with it.  It's easy to load, but you may have to cut your dog treats to size, depending on how big they are.  My only issue is that our dog is already tearing it apart.  He chewed a big chunk out of one side within a week.  I may end up getting one of the ""snowman"" Kong toys, because they seem more durable.

So, this is pretty good - our dog sometimes loses interest pretty quickly, but overall it does what it's supposed to.",1
This item was prescribed by our doctor and found it was less expensive to buy it through amazon.  Our dog is an important part of our family and these pills keep her liver healthy.,1
"I did a lot of research on dog trailers before making this purchase.  Although the DoggyRide Novel is a bit more expensive than other brands, it's definitely worth it.  The trailer is made of high quality materials and is very well thought out.  It's easy for one person to put it together.  My dog is a bit less than 50 pounds and she fits in it nicely.  I haven't found anything yet that I would change.

There's plenty of breeze that goes through the mesh windows but because there's still a cover over the trailer I suspect it gets a bit warm inside.  Dog owners should be sure to park the trailer in the shade when not moving and to bring along water for their dogs.",1
Dog loves this. Wish they lasted longer but this little guy doesn't usually stop til it's all gone. Has great teeth.,1
"Price looks great but cannot be ""Shipped"" to your address!!  I tried to ship this item to: Las Vegas, Carson California, Honolulu Hawaii!
What's up with that?!",0
"Cute toy, but as others have said,  pieces do.jot fit well together.  Even if you snap them.in perfectly,  the edges do not line up. The ball gets caught in pieces that have edges too close together.  Would not purchase again",0
"Fortunately, this arrived broken. It could have been very ugly if it had broken after my beloved cat jumped onto it. Kitty could have been hurt, something might have gotten broke, including the window. There are two wires with a 'button' on the end of each, to be threaded through 2 holes to hold the bed part in place. I had such high hopes for this. I sure hope that I just had bad luck and received the rare product that slipped through quality control undetected, because the thought that this company would allow their product to endanger people's pets and home decorations and windows is hard to accept.

Update: August, 2016.

The lady that owns and operates this business contacted me immediately after posting my review. She was genuinely concerned, stating that they are a small company that makes all of their products themselves, and that they take customer satisfaction seriously. She sent me another, free of charge. Sadly, it broke during the first use, in the exact same place. I called her back. She said that she has never had that happen twice to the same customer. She sent me a third. It seemed better, but here it is two months later and this one also broke in the exact same way. I love to support small businesses, local, made in America, etc. But, I love my cats, and I cannot promote this product. I find it hard to believe that this was just bad luck. I truly hope that they find a solution to this breakage problem. I want them to succeed. I'd even be willing to give them another chance in the future, if the reviews show that improvements had been made.",0
"I have to be honest, I'd never heard of this brand. I purchased these because they were on a lightning deal and our dogs REALLY needed new collars. Theirs were getting pretty mucky. I purchased the pink ones, one large and one medium.

It took a lot of figuring out how to put them on, exactly, because the collar wraps inside itself (through the silver ring). Once we got them adjusted, they looked very smart. We use harnesses to walk our girls (on a dual lead, since they are sled dog breeds and pull quite a bit), so I can't attest to the durability of these collars. I just know they look great. We did NOT put their dog tags on the little plastic clip that is built in. It didn't look sturdy enough to hold for two girls who grab each other by the collar and rip the heck out of each other wrestling. We've lost tags before and can't chance it, as Huskies are runners and our local shelter hasn't quite mastered using the chip scanner yet.",1
within 5 mins the dogs broke it,0
"Once I got the pet collar set up, the collar and receiver did not communicate with each other, even after repeated attempts to reset them.  I am not at all satisfied with the quality of this unit.",0
DE-licious! Works great to de-chlorinate my fish tank water too! Easy to use and instantly rids your tap water of nasty chemicals so it's safe for your fishies!,1
My cats could care less for this item. I hope I can find a cat who will like it to donate this to,0
To small,0
Will never buy again. Severe risk for intestinal blockage.,0
"My puppy got bored and chewed the black rubber off of the bottom, but they still don't tip over or slide around too much. They don't hold a lot of water, but that's okay because we would change it during the day anyways (ever tasted an old glass of water?).",1
"My cats love this set-up, I have three.  One issue is with shipping, received the last two with the bottom plate broke but made it work because I did not want to send the entire box back.",1
able to feed my anemones much easier in my 220 gallon tank.  much better than the chopsticks I was using.,1

Excellent value.  Great product and fast service .  Will order again in a few months.,1
"Product works well for my beagle but feels flimsy when I tried it on my golden retriever's nails... file works well but if you have a larger dog, I don't recommend these nail clippers...",0
Didn't seem to work as advertised. Would not purchase again.,0
I like this very much because it has a nice cuff to hold it on your hand.  Much easier to work with than a sponge you may drop.  I also like it because you can use it in a variety of ways.,1
Never got results! It was been several months. Needed because of puppy sales. Don't waste your money. Should have no stars as option for rating,0

Awesome product - so convenient and easy to take everywhere!",1
I have gotten these for years . . . I have had to get something quick when I have ran out and boy do I miss these bags. They work the best.,1
"it's not really jerky. It is formed parts, more like chicken nuggets made of parts and dried. Dog did not like it either.",0
Absolutely garbage.. I bought the medium as per their size chart .. It wouldn't even go over his head to I ordered an xl.. That was so big could fit two of him.. Then stupid me bought a large.. He can't per without dirtying it.! Wtf.. And I can't return any bc they charge for that.. Don't waste your time the way I did,0

"Some puppies may like this, but mine is disinterested. The hard plastic isn't appealing, and it's a little loud, the rings clack together and the noise isn't appealing. It's not poorly made or anything, but it wasn't a success with my little girl.",0
"I haven't had to get my dogs' teeth cleaned in several years because of these treats. I prefer to buy the medium now just because the texture and shape are better, but these work just as well and have the same chemical that dissolves plaque.",1
"I tried several different brands here from Amazon and sent them all back. Some due to cheap construction. Some where to hard to put on. Some my furry four footed child just did not like (hurt his hands and feet).

This one is the best of the lot. Not cheap but doesn't your child deserve the best?",1
Works wonders on my toy poodle!!,1
I got the comfy cone for my min pin that had to have knee surgery becouse she did not like the plastic e-collar and it looked like she was uncomfortable wearing it. She loves the comfy cone no more fighting her to put it on she can even sleep good in it I highly recommend this product.,1
Even the mini size was too big for my papillon.,0
Not worth the money! It came in pieces! I can't even use it until I get a glue gun to fix the darn thing. Not as advertised at all! Don't buy from here!,0
My dog absolutely hated this collar. She kept taking it off with her paws and would cry whenever I tried to put it on.,0
"My dog (Golden Retriever) spends a lot of time in the pool and tends to get ear infections every 6-8 months.
The first time, I brought him to the vet and the bill, with meds, was almost $250.

We have a lab mix who is an aggressive chewer.  He chipped this antler immediately.  Incredibly disappointed. Will not purchase again.,0
"My betta lives in a 1.5-gallon tank, which is a difficult size for which to find a reliable heater. I've been trying for the past eight months or so to find one that (a) would keep the water warm enough for the fish but (b) wouldn't boil the fish alive.

In my quest, I've tried two Marineland heaters. Neither one worked the way it was supposed to, and yes -- I DID follow the instructions, to the letter. These are the ones I tried:

1. The Marineland Shatterproof 10-Watt Mini Heater (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176DUEY/ref=oss_product) for tanks up to 3 gallons. This one barely kept the water at 74 degrees (even though it's supposedly factory preset for 78) and it only worked for a couple weeks. It quit, and I was back to wrapping a human's heating pad around the tank while I searched for a replacement.

2. The Shatterproof Mini Heater 10watt (http://www.amazon.com/MarineLand-SHATTERPROOF-MINI-HEATER-10WATT/dp/B0037PJMMC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1286290350&sr=8-4), also for tanks up to 3 gallons. This one heated the water into the high 80s, even though it, too, was supposedly factory preset for 78. I don't know how much higher it would have gone, and I didn't dare leave it on overnight for fear I'd be facing a boiled fish in the morning. I yanked it out of the tank and went back to the heating pad.

Finally, I found the Elite Submersible Preset Mini Heater 25W - Elite A748. It's compact, it's unobtrusive, and it actually works as advertised. After a little fiddling with the adjustable control, my betta is now comfy and cozy at about 76 degrees. I don't have to worry about it boiling him overnight, and the tank stays warm even now that the nights are starting to get chilly and our house hovers at 69 degrees. I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far I'm very happy with it.

I'll try to remember to update this review after a few months, but for right now, my recommendation is to avoid Marineland products -- or at least, the ones with ""factory presets."" Maybe their adjustable ones are better, but my Marineland experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.

UPDATE: It is now Feb. 9, 2011, and the heater is still going strong, despite several power blinks and outages during a recent Midwest blizzard. My fish is happy. I am happy. Life is good.

UPDATE #2: It is now June 18, 2012. I just realized I hadn't given an update on this item and figured it would be worthwhile. Sadly, ""Sushi"" has left us due to natural causes, but this little gem worked like a champ right up until we didn't need it anymore, sometime during the 2011 holidays. Now it's in storage, waiting for another fish to warm, should we choose to get one.",1
"I'm not really sure why but my 5 month old puppy gets sick whenever I give her these (diarrhea, vomiting).",0

Very good product both the reagents and instructions.,1
"I have a nearly blind betta fish that I use this for.  He was unable to see where the food was before and would only bite at empty air.  I place it over his head and pile on some floating food, and now he can find it.  The food does not float away thanks to this contraption, and afterwords, I can remove the remaining food from the tank so that it does not become ammonia.  He is doing very well now.",1

"i loved this collar at first. However , 2 months or so after I put the collar on my 11 lbs. 5year old  Pomeranian Jack ,he to started have seizures.

I took off the collar the seizures stopped! Hope this helps, please keep an eye out different behavior...",0
"I hesitate to say this is a failure, and haven't tried to return it. My dog is just a the 20 lb. mark, which i believe is the limit for this crate. The dimensions seemed to match the old one (which we're back to using). Maybe I didn't put it together correctly - but, it sure looked fine and it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to do this. Anyway, put my dachshund Mick in the kennel and left him at home while I ran errands. Got home and he had not just opened the door, he knocked it right off its hinges, flat on the floor! He was running around merrily, apparently quite proud of himself for breaking out of prison. We are back to the very slightly larger, chewed up and dilapidated old kennel. It looks awful - but it works. I'm actually adopting another, smaller dog and hope this kennel will work for him. If he also manages to escape, I may contact the manufacturer.",0
"I have had this gray and black cat tree for around a month now. It was easy to put together and looked nice, until my cat actually used it. The carpeted posts look terrible once my cat used them for scratching posts, which he is supposed to do. One of the balls came off already and is unraveling. It is not very sturdy and the materials are cheap. This is the first product review I have written, but every time I look at this now ugly and tore up cat tower in my living room, I feel compelled to warn future buyers. Don't do it.",0
"i have two cats, none of which like this cat bed. I even sprayed it with catnip to attract them - no luck.",0
"Husband threw it out. Great idea, but poorly executed. (I was bummed) The trapper does not collect enough, just spills more upon removal. Does not get to corners where urine clumps.

Not what I had hoped for after hearing good reviews.",0
My fish don't care for these.,0
"Was only able to use this about twice before the metal ring you hook the lead or leash to fell off. It lit up fine, but falling apart that easy wasn't thrilled with. My dog is very obedient and he wasn't pulling when it fell off. I was hooking him up to the leash for a walk & it fell apart.",0
The dispenser doesnt stay shut. The bags don't unwind. Its bulky and just not worth the money. Really disappointed in this A&H product.,0
"This harnesses is one of the finest made I have ever seen. It is very well padded and says everything it is. My Sheppard husky loves it and she is easily handled using this product. Any place else for a harness of this quality, you would pay up to $85.00 and up.",1
"Our heeler/collie puppy pulled the rope toy apart at the knot in the middle on one side within 15 minutes after installation. Good concept especially for dogs bred to tug/pull, nip and shake their prey or animals they are guiding and protecting IF the knot were more secure. Maybe some people will have better luck with this than us. Only complaint is the knot coming apart so fast.",0
The can does not last very long.,0
"This crate arrived very quickly. It was very easy to ""pop up. It is large enough for my puppy to sleep and play.",1

The slightly different types of the same color work well together.  Nice.,1
Legit product. Would recommend for purchase.,1
This is good for holding treats but very difficult to get treats out easily. Often times had to take it off my belt or leash to get treats out.,0
The tag is very easy to read. Very thick and sturdy. But my street address was wrong.,1
They don't fit anything.,0
"I have been using Marineland water pumps/ power heads for over fifteen years. Normally the pumps would last for about three years before I have to replace them, more often because of the impeller worn out. Recently I bought five of these pumps without reading the reviews given here (quite unfortunately). I installed the first pump and after two days it stopped working. I was amazed as I never had this before and opened the pump just to find out the impeller paddles were broken. They were the purple impeller replacing the old white one mentioned in the reviews here. Then I went on to the second pump, which it won't work out of the box, this time was apparently a bad engine. The third pump worked for two days and then stopped working, the engine again. The fourth pump won't work out of the box. The fifth pump worked for a week and the purple impeller paddles broke. All the pumps have a silver ""passed"" seal (quality control) on them. I am amazed that a company in which you trust (and that most likely knows about the problem) can do this to their customers. For me is almost two hundred dollars lost. I will never buy a Marineland product in my life again. My advice is, think about it before you do...",0
This is the best fitting back seat cover I have used. The only downside is that it is not water proof.,1
This supplement really helped my dog when nothing else would.,1
Works as expected,1
My dogs love this food!,1
I bought some at a yard sale and my car loves them so much I bought her more. She sleeps with them,1
"I bought two of these.. The first one only lasted two days. The second one lasted around 25ish days, while the second one lasted a lot longer I went to turn it on and was fetching crickets out of the cricket box when it literally exploded all over...

Good quality and length.,1

"Buyer beware, this item is so cheap for a reason. The batteries go dead in no time, and several of them were already dead when we put them in our device. Will not be buying again.",0
"I never write reviews but this collar has been worth the money and more. I bought not having very high expectations but I am pleasantly surprised. My dog figured out she can get two barks in before it does anything besides beeping but it had been a lifesaver for the days she wants to lay outside and I don't want to disrupt the neighborhood. She is an 8lb Maltese mix and the vibration is just enough to irritate her into stopping. We have been using it for 3 or 4 weeks and I'm hoping it continues the way it is. It's an awesome value for the money as some other ""little dog"" collars can run upwards of $90. I am very happy.",1
It is my understanding that the manufacture is no longing making or selling these. I was sorry to hear this as my dogs loved them as a treat.,1
"This product is not at all what I expected. We now don't use it at all because it worked so poorly. First thing is the quality. It all just seems really cheap and poorly made. Then it only works if the dog is facing in the same direction as the remote and the remote is pointed directly at the sensor on the collar. This doesn't work when a dog is running around barking (which is exactly when you need it to work). I thought about giving it to a friend, but I wouldn't even want to do that. I will likely just donate it to the Goodwill. Great price, but you are getting exactly what you're paying for so don't expect much beyond that.",0
"We buy exclusively (I thought) through Prime because if you don't like it you can return it.  The only good thing about this product is the little pink carrier and even that has hardly any windows. The poor pet would feel like it is in prison, not out for a nice stroll.  The stroller itself is junk, flimsy and the wheels don't even all touch the ground.  It may last a month, not confident in that even.  The would only take it back if I paid $20 shipping.  Really not worth the price or hassle. So I'm stuck with it.",0
The product is very useful. My dogs are a matted mess. They won't  sit still so I have to do a section at a time.,1
"My sheltie had 3 accidents within a 2 week period this last spring... we don't know why, but she hasn't done it since, so we think she might not have been feeling well.  In any case, I had some carpet to clean with an enzymatic cleaner, and while I knew the general area, I couldn't remember exactly where Zoey had gone pee.

You have to use this detector in a pitch dark room....  I think most UV lights have this limitation, even for the professionals.  At our old house, we had a pro carpet cleaner come in and treat pet stains, and they could only do this at night with their UV detector, so the cleaners were over late at night to detect and treat.

When I used the Simple Solution Spotter, the urine showed up as very pale, dull yellow spots on my dark thick brown carpet.  Zoey has a habit of starting to walk away before she's fully finished peeing, so there were little trailing drips I had to track down - this was the hardest part of treating the stains.  Other than having to be on my hands and knees, staring hard at the carpet, it was easy enough to start at one area, and work my way backwards until I'd found all 3 spots she'd made.

I'm glad I bought the Simple Solution UV Urine Detector even though I've only had occasion to use it once, and amazon had a lower price than my local pet supply store.

Not that this has to do with the detector itself, but I found it helpful to use a manual pressure sprayer while treating the stains.  I found mine in the garden supply area of a hardware store.  Mine's larger than regular trigger spray bottles, and you can tilt it forward and downward to spray the carpet - something that's hard to do with a trigger spray bottle, as liquid would move away from the straw part of the trigger bottle, and nothing would come out.  This wasn't a problem with the manual pressure sprayer...  I'd fill it, pump it to build pressure, and I'd have plenty of stain treater to do the entire area.  This way, I didn't have to stop to refill the bottle, coming back to the carpet and trying to find where I left off.  Hope this tip helps!",1
"It only came with the shirt, missing the belt hat handcuffs and radio.... basically everythimg",0

Gorgeous product. Just perfect for our Boston!,1
"Very sad. I have bought many of these in the past and they remain my cat's favorite. However, the last 3 I have ordered haven't held up more than a day or two. The quality has definitely deteriorated. Very unfortunate :( They used to last FOREVER (until I tossed them bc they were so dirty and kitty-saliva filled).",0
"I have had my beagle for around 8 months.  He is only 1 1/2 and pretty much still a puppy.  I live in a residential neighborhood and he is in an electronic fenced in yard.  Lots of people walk on the road and work in their yards.  Oscar found it necessary to charge the road and bark at anyone who walked up the road, even the lady who goes for a 6 am run!  He also barked at my neighbors when they mowed or walked in their yards.  If you have ever heard a beagle bark, they are very loud.  I was at my wits end, thinking I was going to have to get rid of him.  I decided to give this collar a try.  For $30-40, it could not hurt.  Oscar is a quiet little guy now.  He walks to the edge of our yard and sits and watches people walk by with their dogs without a sound.  He wants to bark, but knows that he will get a little spray if he does.  Love this product!  The lady across the street wants the info for her yorkie that barks at everyone seeing how well it works on Oscar.  Be sure to keep the spray full.  Oscar knows that if it is empty and he can get one bark out,  he is free to go crazy and bark.  He does sometimes get just one bark out to test it, but that is all.  Most of the time, he is silent and like the neighbors say, they would not even know he was here.  Well worth it if you have a dog annoying the neighbors!",1
"Original purchase date: October 2013, we are finally giving up on this coat and finding a replacement in January 2015. When we first received the Kakadu dog coat we were excited to find something water resistant with a warm fleece interior to help our short-haired dog stay warm during a true Northeast winter. The first issue was that the velcro around the neck would constantly come undone. We took matters into our hands and hand sewed the neck straps to turn the coat into a slip on. After that, the coat worked wonderfully, for about a winter and a half. About 14 months after purchase, the velcro on the belly straps became the new issue and will not stay strapped. Unfortunately I won't be able to sew the straps together like I did with the neck, so we are now looking for a more reliable option.",0

"I've had 2 doors from PetSafe in previous homes (just like this one i thought).  We had this installed when we moved into our new home in October 2014 and within a week we were having problems.  At first i thought it was just installed poorly... so we adjusted and re-installed over and over again for the last 6 months... it just keeps falling apart!  the areas/frame is made out of plastic where it ""secures"" to the wall and it just keeps loosening up.  I've had handymen and licensed contractors attempt to ""fix it""  Finally yesterday the WHOLE THING FELL APART!  I should have returned it immediately!",0
"I have two dogs. One is very well behaved but still has a little too much puppy energy at times.  The other has some serious anxiety issues (to the point where I have used Prozac with him).  These are great for my younger dog when we are going to the vet.  I use them daily on the other dog and have noticed a big difference. He isn't zoned out, but the pacing, barking, whining, etc have greatly diminished.",1

"Do not purchase this if you have a pet with anxiety. My 30 pound dog scratched and chewed his way through the fabric after only having this 5 days. Waste of money. Ended up having to go back to a wire cage. Positives are that it is light weight, easy to set up and soft.  Ery easy to transport.",0

After ordering and using the new form of Petmate Fresh Flow Filters I can say that I'm not happy with them at all.  I find that after a few hours the back side of the filter becomes slimmy and I must rinse it out.  I am afraid to use the filter more than once because of the slime factor that occurs in just a short while.  I have no idea how much bacteria is being held within the filter.  I feel that my only option is to change out my Petmate Fresh flow fountains for some other brand if I can only purchase the new filters. In all honesty I didn't want to give this new type of filter any stars for its rating.,0
Hi! Wonderful product. Noticed fast results on my pup.,1
"This is my first scooper after reviewing several different models. I got it today and used it. I am very pleased with the use and construction of this model. The handle is easy to squeeze to open the claws. They have different sized teeth to grab it all, and close firmly. I opened the claws and the mess fell into a plastic garbage bag easily. I rinsed the scooper with the hose and it's ready for the next use. Great purchase! Thanks Amazon.",1

very dissatisfied with this. runs extremely small and trying to receive a refund has been a nightmare.  I've given up trying,0
Size was mis-represented.  Buy these all the time (about 6 inches in length).  Missed where it said these were 3 inches.  Paid too much (and was a lighting deal) SMH.,0
Great for my small dogs!,1
Great product,1
"Waste of money, my tiny dog ripped the wing and pulled out the stuffing within two days.  Expected better quality from Kong",0
"Great food. Our dog loves it. About the same price as Raw food without the danger of contamination, which, apparently, caused our Frenchie to get salmonella poisoning that caused him very scary rectal bleeding twice (as per our vet). He did great on Raw food, but after two salmonella poisonings, we fell it was time  for a change.

We first tried NRG, which is more expensive than honest kitchen; we didn't like it at all.

On NRG, our Frenchie had 3 large very hard poops per day. He would sometimes look like we was straining (like we do when we have very hard large poop...it can be painful). Normally, when our frenchie  was on Raw food he had 2 small, well formed (not hard) poops per day. I agree which other critics of NRG who state NRG contains more undigestible ingredients (i.e. fiber) which is why several critics of NRG on amazon say their dogs had larger, harder stool on NRG and had bowel movements more often.

Then we tried Honest Kitchen: Love.

Once our Frenchie was on Honest Kitchen: Love, his stool went back to 2 small well formed poops per day just like when we was on raw food, and no more painful poops.",1
"My dog is OBSESSED with this toy and I can't hear her squeaking it at me every 2 minutes. Great purchase! She isn't usually a ""shredder"" with toys, but with some thin ones she will tear them apart. This one is lasting very well for her and she treats it like her ""baby"".",1

Tried it and saw no difference. As soon as I brought my new baby home my cat was jealous and started peeing right outside of her litterbox. Followed all the instructions and guess my cat is too stubborn for some fancy litter to stop her rebelliousness. Wish it worked!

My pibble weighs about 61 lbs and for a pitbull he's on the slim side. His neck measures 22"" and length 24"".
This hoodie fits him great around the chest, the hoodie doesn't reach the head, hehe but it covers his thick neck. He doesn't like to wear anything over his head anyway.
He has a slim waist so the hoodie is a bit loose around that area but it doesn't get wet when he goes peeing, yay!
He looks very comfortable wearing it.",1
I know the gerbils and rabbits like these BUT they have moods they pick at them (maybe lazy) Variety is good Keeps them busy,1

"I have to say that out of all of the canine dental products currently on the market, these are, without a doubt, the very best. I have an 11 year old golden retriever with relatively atrocious breath. Nothing - and I mean nothing - ever seemed to minimize the foul odor. And, since she is an open-mouth breather, I've been on a mission to find a product that allows us to stay in the same room with her without gagging (OK, slight overstatement, but you get the picture). Anyhow, Bright Bites actually do the trick. She LOVES them, they don't cause gastro-intestinal upset, AND her breath in monumentally more pleasant. I highly, highly recommend this product for any Dog mom or dad in pursuit of fresh breath for his or her canine companion(s)!

P.S. My 6 year old boxer loves them as well. :)",1
"Received but without the screws.  Once I make it to the hardware store so I can hang it up, I'll update if it works well

***update***

While it works as advertised, it's very loud and scares the life out of my rottweiler!  He about pulls your arm out of the socket to try and get on the other side of me so he won't have to touch it.  Only thing he has ever been scared of.  So I give it one more star but keeping the rating low because they shipped me an incomplete product that made me have to go out to find the rest.",0
"I love this harness for my dog. He pulls on the leash like he's running against the wind for fun. Its helps to have a little more control, and I won't control him by his neck. BUT, make sure you clip the leash into the harness and the collar, for my wiggle worm has slipped out at peak opportunities, like at the vet's office and to chase a cat while we were wine tasting.",1
My dog thinks these are treats... I hide 3 of his medications in a single chew twice a day and he happy takes them right down...,1
Comes out way to fast!,0
He just doesn't like them like he likes Dingo brand,0
All 7 cats spoiled by this.,1
Great value. The bone-shaped holder isn't easy to open or retrieve bags from when actually out on a walk with your pup and ends up being more cumbersome than useful.,1
Enough said don't you think?  No complaints from the fur ball either.  That's about all one could expect from a flea and tick control.,1

"I have a rescued Dachshund who was found wandering the streets of Houston. He is terrified of thunder and lightening storms. It was virtually impossible to calm him down until I bought this calming coat for him. An unexpected and violent storm hit the Dallas area yesterday and he was freaking out until I put this coat on him. I've never seen anything like it. He literally stopped whining, pacing and shaking the instant I fastened it on him. I can't say enough good things about this product. Do not hesitate to buy this coat. Your dogs will thank you and you'll have restored peace to his and your home!",1
"My dog LOVES this bed.  Since this is in her dog house, I put a wool blanket over the top to save some time in between washes, (I haven't tried it yet, but will soon be washing it in my washing machine, since I've read reviews that this washes well), and she drags it out to be able to lay on the bed itself.  Very pleased with the quality as well.  I will be purchasing another to go in her kennel.",1
"Seems to be an individual thing in what works for different cats, as well as the rules different owners have for them. This didn't product do much to deter my cat, and was a pain in the rear for the humans. However, it would probably work for some cats, as well as have some other uses.

I don't like my cat to walk on the kitchen counters (I don't let humans do that either!!). Totally grosses me out. Cats walk around in their litter boxes! Mine doesn't bury her poop, which is a totally different story. I don't want to have to disinfect my counters every time I cook, just in case the cat's been up there. Only want to clean counters after cooking. We don't care if the cat gets on the couch or beds. We like to snuggle with the cat on that furniture in my house. To each his/her own. However, IF this sound bothers your cat, it would work well for training him/her to stay off of furniture or counter, or stay away from certain areas.

The problem for us was that the darn thing goes off every time you come near it, even on the low setting. If you turn it off while working in the kitchen, it makes that sound when you turn it back on, plus you have to remember to do that. If all you're doing is getting something to drink in the kitchen, then it's just annoying. We would hear it going off during the night and sometimes when no one is in the room. Things are still knocked off the counter, spilled, etc. Don't know how long she stays up there, but it's still happening just as frequently.

I'll share one thing that's helped me, because I've learned a lot of ideas from others sharing them in reviews. This cat suddenly started getting on the kitchen counter a lot more often than she had in the past. When there's a behavior change in anybody or anything, it's good to try to figure out what's been different since the time the behavior changed. I figured out that when I started putting her cat food into a pretty cookie jar instead of a sealed canister is around the time when the counter surfing amped up. Easy solution: the food went back to a sealed container. I'm still looking for an effective way to keep her from ever getting on the counters, but it's happening a lot less when she can't smell the food there. Wouldn't you be willing to climb a counter if you were hungry and smelled a luscious steak up there?

This product could be useful for other times when you want a warning or deterrent. Might work to deter toddlers from going where you don't want them to go. However, it's NOT loud enough to alert you to them getting to something dangerous, such as out the door to a pool or getting into something poisonous. More like getting a cookie between meals, or alerting you to them getting up after a nap.",0
"This product has definitely been worth the money for me.  My cats love it,  they use it for scratching,  lounging,  playing and as a surveying point to plot their next attack...  It's a lot of fun to watch them on it.  I thought they may tire of it but after more then 2 years they still use it daily.

This item has held up very well for all that it is used.  The material on the shelves is not thick and some of the corners have started to come loose but it does not affect the functionality of this item.  I did screw the base to the door  between the second and third shelves just to prevent the base from banging against the door when a cat jumps in or off of it (this was recommended by another reviewer and has worked great).  It's not necessary to do that,  you can improvise and wedge something behind it if you don't want to damage the door.

I hope this helps!",1

This did not keep my daughter's small fish tank clear at all.  She has one larger goldfish and that is it.  Still murky water.,0
These really are durable.  My 2 German Shepherds can destroy almost any toy in a matter of minutes.  These withstand their tough chewing.  They are extremely heavy so keep this in mind.  They also have a strong rubber smell which does diminish with time.  Downside:  My dogs really don't like them and rarely play with them and they were somewhat expensive.,0
I never post reviews but this has to be one of the worst designed products ever. Instructions include beating the halves together with a mallet. Really!?!? and even then the parts don't fit well. A little engineering could have gone a long way here. The hinge pin broke during the install so now I'm left with a screen to replace.,0

"Within a week of working with this crate, my American Pit Bull Terrier had identified the weak spot in one of door hinges and had literally torn it off. As far as I can tell, the hinges for the doors were glued/painted together. It feels sturdy, and looks sturdy, but when it comes down to the actual design of it, a smart dog that works on weak spots will not have a problem taking it apart. Also, when I opened it, I had at least three metal pieces that fell out of the box - not something that inspires confidence in a crate ostensibly designed for securing a stronger breed of dog.",0
"Exceptional Customer Service... It has been my experience that you can have a bad experience with any product at any time, at some point in your life. Sometimes you just get a bad batch. What can turn that bad experience into a positive one and turn an unhappy customer into a loyal long term customer is how that experience is handled. I am updating my review and changing my rating to 5 stars because even though I received a ""bad batch""..., when I contacted customer service to express my dissatisfaction they did every thing they could to make things right and make sure I was happy. These are without a doubt the best Yak chews I have purchased so far, and I have tried a few. And when I received an order that wasn't up to the high standard I had come to expect from this company they made it right. Excellent product and excellent customer service. I would highly recommend this product... so do my dogs!!",1

LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have the Vienna case & together the products are awesome! My husband uses the magnetic strips in his phone so he can use the magnetic car mount.

"I purchased this UV light/pump combo based on the price. Not only were the other UV clarifiers I looked at more expensive than this one but I would also have to purchase a seperate pump. I would have spent twice as much money to purchase them seperate. Another great thing about this UV/pump is that it is submersible so theres not a bunch of hoses running out of the pond and the UV is not mounted to the side of the pond so it doesn't take away from the natural look of the pond. I put this in my pond and it took about 4 days to completely clear my pond.{after I figured out there was a flow control valve and I turned it all the way up).Actually the pump was in my pond for about 12-14 days total and my pond was only about 60% clear but it was because the water flow valve was turned down, as of right now my pond is perfectly clear and the fish seem to be swimmimg around more instead of just staying on one side of the pond and at the bottom. The instructions are very vague and this is why I was not aware that there was a flow control nob on the pump because it is not clearly marked in the diagram. This is very important because if the valve is turned down the pump will  not pump the water through fast enough for the UV clarifier to clear up the water. I have a 500 gallon pond and the pump is only a 270gph pump. The flow nob is on top of the pre-filter cover so it looks more like it is there to lock the cover in place. Another complaint I have about this product is the smaller pre-filter (it has two) has to be cleaned about every 4-5 days or you will lose water output to the fountain head,But I think this is the case with almost every prefilter on any brand pump. I gave this pump 4 stars instead of 5 because of the vague instructions,the easily clogged prefilter and the size,it is very large (over a foot long and very bulky).I would not suggest this product for larger ponds because the 270 gph pump may not be strong enough. Despite a couple of negatives this product does exactly what it says it will do and is worth the money!!

Update 7/29/2012

Suddenly this product has stopped working!!! I noticed that the water in my pond was becoming green again. I cleaned the filters and placed the pump back in the pond. Everything seemed fine. I came back outside later that evening to check on the pond and the pump was not working!! I checked the breaker box to make sure the circuit breaker had not tripped (it had not).I left the pump unplugged for a couple of hours and plugged it back in and it started working again. The problem is it only works for a few hours and then it stoped working again. If I unplug it for a few hours then plug it back in it works but will eventually stop again....In the process of returning it to the seller for a refund!!!",0

"I have been using the jumbo liners for several years and been happy with the bags...until now.

Minor grievances first. The packaging and way the bags are packed were changed as well. They are extremely tight and no longer come out easily. The bags themselves are also now connected in roll form and must be torn from each other. This while annoying I expect I could get used to, even if I never really came to like.

BUT, they also changed the bag dimensions as well. Not by much, but enough so that they are no longer tight and I can't expect them to stay up by themselves. They also appear to be shorter, but this could be simply perception only since the bag won't stay up.

End result is that I will be using garbage bags that are way too large instead since they won't fall in and will do the job I expect them to do.

Yes it catches the big, loose clumps and poo in the pull-out tray, but it left the clumps that were stuck to the plastic.  Also, one of my boys likes to pee against the wall, so when I rolled the box, the litter clumped to the sifting grates - a real pain to get off. All in all, I was spending just as long, if not longer, having to clean the litter box each day.  After a month and a half of fighting this thing, I removed the sifting piece and dremeled off the bottom plastic clips that held the sifter in place. Now my kitties have just a regular jumbo litter box with a window to look out of (where the collection tray slid in) when they do their business.

As for the arthritis diagnosis below?  Well, my trusted doctor missed this call.  Nikko actually has an ACL injury and we are treating that in a completely different manner.  He is however, making great progress to which I must give some credit to the nutritional superiority of Premium Edge Dog Food.

FORMER REVIEW:

OK, with the above title said, I'll qualify the statement in defense of Premium Edge dog food.  It seems like something he should love but he is a very spoiled Malamute Husky who has recently been diagnosed with arthritis.  Because of that, I have given him every kind of fresh fish and meat I can to get him to swallow his medicine.  Now he thinks he should have chicken cordon blue or baked salmon for every meal or he turns up his nose at it.

He also has developed a taste for the grocery store dog food that he seems to love (not a good thing).

I'm going to keep trying to get him to switch foods because I know in my heart that this dog food is better for him than the one he currently prefers.

I will definitely come back and update my review when he starts eating this brand.

Thanks

"A few hours after receiving this item, my house became infested with maggots! I was horrified that they were swarming my new dogs water dish like lava spewing out of a volcano. Inside the compartment there is a sponge where countless maggots were stuck in trying to escape. My floors were litterally swimming with maggots. I immediately through the water dish out in my garbage can, which also became infested with maggots. It was the worst purchase and product I ever encountered and my dog had drank from this! I am completely mortified!",0
"It looks really nice, just as shown in the photos. Before purchasing though, make sure your litter box will fit. We have big cats, so we have big litter boxes. They were too long and the door would not shut. We kept it though and are using it for all their toys.",1
Great refugium at a great price. The only con for such a small pump it hums louder that I would expect it to. That being said I would definitely recommend it!,1
"Found this out after I purchased and went in to a pet store;

Black Kong Toy - For power chewers/Large Breed Dogs

Red Kong Toy - For small/light chewers to possibly well behaved medium dogs

Does not matter the age of your dog.  Even if you have a 2 month old puppy, go by their breed and adult size!

Got this for my 6 month old Boxer/Mastiff puppy.  Toy is destroyed within 3 minutes.  I keep cutting the rope and retying it, but it lasted a week.

They really need to put this information in these descriptions so customer's do not have to go through this hassle.",0
Very nice. Delivered as advertised.,1
"I ordered the 5 inch holy roller toy for my pup. The item I received is indeed labled 5 - inches, but is barely two! I absolutely cannot use this for my pup. It's a choking hazard.",0
"While the product would have prevented my dog from damaging the door by scratching, I could not properly secure it to the door with the provided velcro spots. The protector is made from a heavy, flexible plastic and the stickers were not up to the task of supporting the weight, causing it to swing away from the door and into the door frame when the door was opened. Because of these issues I was unable to use the product and removed it completely.",0
It looked super cute on my dog but it fell apart in less than a month! Threads were coming out and it just didn't hold up its shape when my dog was wearing it. Ordered less than a month ago and already bought him  a new collar.,0
Not very good clumping litter. Hardly any clumps at all.  And should come wrapped in plastic.  Box was damaged litter everywhere.,0
"I didn't expect a piece identical to the one in the picture, but the wood that arrived was much less visually interesting. Still a nice, large piece of wood for the price.",1
"We use these steps to help our mid-sized dog get into a medium size SUV, and it works great for that purpose.  They are very sturdy and the design with slightly sloping steps is really nice.  We got the wide size not because of the size of the dog, but just to make it more convenient to hit the steps.",1
was priced cheap and there is a reason why- would not feel safe putting my dog in this item,0
"Very underwhelmed with the product. Dog wriggles right out of them. Originally ordered a small for my dachshund, but even though he was in the size range, they were so tight he couldn't sit comfortably. Now, with the medium, he just has to roll once or twice and he's out of it. They have no stretch whatsoever, just a band of fabric. The elastic is great, the fabric seems like it would soak up urine if needed, but WILL NOT stay on (which totally defeats the purpose). Definitely need a different type of stretchy fabric. Bummer!",0
didn't work for my dog,0
"Purchased after veterinarian recommended giving milk thistle to my 10 year old shihtzu with liver problems, it has helped a ton!",1
"Must have got a bad batch or something they upset both of my dogs stomachs which is pretty unusual, they have had these before with no problems. After figuring out the cause of their soft stools I stopped giving them these and just tossed the rest of them in the trash. Waste of money.",0
I used the product as per instructions but I really didn't notice any effect. I like the idea of natural products but I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item.,0
My cat doesn't even like this toy. It just lays in the same spot.,0
"My corgi loves this toy.  This is actually a replacement for one I bought in a bricks and mortar pet store, which eventually stopped squeaking due to age and use.  My dog doesn't try to eat this, but I would watch your dog with it to make sure they don't try.",1
"I velcroed the bowls in, since my cats immediately learned they could take those out and easily reach in for more food.  They still can reach in and self-dispense, but I'm hoping to figure out a way around that soon.  There is nothing to prevent your animals from moving these all over the room, since there is no non-stick surface to the bottom.  The lid is not very secure, so I'm affraid if I secure the base more, they will find a way to tip the whole thing over and get food from the top.",0
I have been using this to maintain a 70 degree temperature inside a cooler that houses a beer fermented. Maintains a perfect 70 deg at all times. (I do have it on a GFCI outlet just in case fermentation gets a bit to active.),1
"My cats LOVE these treats. Cat and dog treats are exactly the same except for size of the pieces and I prefer the dog treats because 1. The cats actually likes the bigger chunks and 2. The larger size seems to resist crushing better. While I LOVE the product I HATE the packaging because a bag doesn't prevent crushing and there is always a ton of chicken ""dust"" at the bottom. I was hesitant to order from Amazon because I feared what would happen in shipping. I've ordered twice and have no complaints.
This is an expensive product but definitely worth it, just wish the manufacturer would provide in a better package, I would even spend more for the product if spoilage could be reduced.
I know some users have said their pets like the dust sprinkled on their food but mine don't so it's annoying to see waste every time, but I'm a sucker for whatever makes my animals happy.",1
"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.

Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.

The way it usually works for me is:
*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*
""Where is it?""
*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*
With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.

It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.

Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.

The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.

Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.

A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.

I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.

I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.

Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""
These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick some liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.
Sometimes it squirts out in unpredictable directions or apparently blows air, because my one dog backs away when I squeeze.

I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning.",0
I was very surprised when I open the box and it was so tiny. But I actually used it to pump about 800 gallons off the top of my pool cover and it only took Maybe two and a half hours!,1
Puppies love it and it's still in one piece. I call that succes!,1
This is so handy.  Now I don't have to take out a bag of cat waste a couple of times a day.,1
Easy to use and the dogs like it,1
Great vest with excellent customer service...  please keep up the good work!,1
Cases of canned food take an entire shelf in either place. This fits perfectly beside the milk and liters of juice.,1
Good item,1
"great value, I bought this on auto delivery because I use a lot of these, I have two dogs on lots of medications. without this product they would never take their medicine. I also use it on top of their food to get them to start to eat, works great.",1
"They work great, we have a large dog and a puppy and it is easy to separate their food and scoop out!",1
Not durable and came with holes where the rods insert into bottom of tent have not used it yet but when i do im sure it will poke through and collapse,0
Still using this almost daily for over a year and works great on my 7 lb. dog.,1
"Best pet product I've ever bought. With 4 dogs and 5 cats, I needed away to keep the dogs out of the cat food and unfortunately litter but open enough for the cats to get in and out. This door buddy works perfectly. It is adjustable and durable. I would recommend this to all animal lovers.",1
My dog loves this bed. It is big enough for my 25 pounder to rest in. Yet it is small enough to be cleaned in my washing machine. What makes this bed better than others is that it is well cushioned on the bottom.,1
There were reviews that said the durability of the toy was poor. I have a Weimaraner and the toy has held up fine with her. She plays with it constantly and it is still fully intact. Good deal for the price.,1
Fall apart easy,0
I put this vest on my hound and connected the Velcro straps. When the dog returned within an hour- she did not have a vest on . It was gone for good. Complete waste of money.,0
Break easily!,0
The scent is horrible and not pleasant at all. I got some on my hands and I had a hard time eliminating the odor off of my hands. Now I'm stuck with a gallon.,0
"The fasteners were not identical to my old ones, but the work just the same.  I don't anticipate any problems with these in the future.

I do recommend these to anyone looking for replacement fasteners for their pet carrier.",1
My dogs tore this up the first day,0
"Works great ""Storm Trooper"" our local hermit crab is happy and healthy, just need to find a rebel friend. I would highly recommend this pad as a quality product and great price.",1
My dogs had no visible relief from the fleas. 22.00 down the toilet.,0
"Total CRAP!!!! Did not even last 5 minutes,I just got it 20 minutes ago,unhooked the one I had,and hooked this one up,less then 3 minutes and it was buzzing so loud it was drowning out the TV,and it didn't even push air thru the 3 air stones it was hooked up too!!!",0
I have ordered these several times now. My dogs absolutely love them. I live in a rural area and cannot get them locally. I have two small dogs and these are just the right size for them.,1
Runs really small.,0
"My cat loved it! We got it a few weeks ago and she still plays with it, she will even play with it when its off.",1
Nice quality,1
Been buying this for years. Cats love this scratcher the best. And play with the ball occasionally too. Especially after I add catnip to the scratcher.,1
"The price is right, though the box was a little smaller than I expected, it was otherwise fine.  The problem came when it was time to clean it.  First, it has indentations and ridges on the inside area, which makes it hard to clean if you use clumping litter.  Second, when I went to go dump it out, I banged against the side of my trash can to make sure everything is out before I wash it, like I do ALL of my litter boxes--and it nearly cracked in half. I had to throw the entire thing out.  I do this with all my litterboxes, and I have some that are literally years old, so it wasn't me. So, very cheaply made, and probably won't last very long.  I have two more, I bought 3 at once, so I'll have to see how long they last.",0
there is nothing erratic about this ball unless it is thrown on asphalt. In the grass it behaves like anyother ball.,0
"Ordered 3 of these for my dog since he loves the crinkly noise and being able to toss it around without stuffing flying out. Originally bought one at a local store where I live, then went onto Amazon to see if I could order it for less. I was iffy because it isn't the same brand I buy in stores. The one I bought in store has lasted him a few months - very durable. Once I gave this brand toy to my dog, he tore the squeaker out and ripped the toy open in less than 10 minutes. Horrible quality and now I have two extra I can't give to him! Not worth the money and a major safety hazard!!",0
The Ripple rug flops over when try to make tunnels and hills. Ripple rug is better for kittens.,0
"Misleading product, does not actually prevent pulling, only makes it worse. Expect sore/wrenched shoulders, the dog to pull the loop from your wrist, and tripping over your dog. Total waste of money.",0
These are a great idea in theory but they aren't strong enough to hold a dog in the tub.,0
"This Swheat Scoop Natural Cat Litter was so light that it stuck to my cat's paws and that made her uneasy. She was never in the litter box more than a few seconds and after jumping out of the box, she shook her legs to get the clingy litter off of them. Now I am back to clay-type litter. She likes the density of clay litter.

If your cats hate sticky material to their feet, this product may not work.",0
"Our pad has been in use for two months, with no problems. We are using it to heat the ""second floor"" room in a Feralvilla we got for a feral kitty we've been feeding. He seems to like having an insulated bedroom with radiant heat!",1
I don't know what all you can say about a bag holder but it does the job. Very convenient to just hook up to the leash and then not have to worry about having a bag with you when you walk out the door.,1
This product just terrible. On the day it arrived we went to hook it up in our car. As we were hooking it up around the back of the seat the strap broke. We hadn't even pulled it tight or Anything. We decided to tuck it in around the the seat.  Note that it still wasn't tight. When the dogs got in the back seat the entire middle ripped. Just horrible!!,0
this is so beautiful! my boys love different colors on our aquarium and have to take turns,1
I ordered this for my 8 year old cat. He had a yeast infection in both ears! I used it for 4 weeks and now his ears are clean. I would highly recommend this product!,1
"Cats love this stuff,  although it does become costly when they expect one or two each day.",1
"My dog has the most sensitive stomach ever, we have tried every expensive dog food imaginable and everything made her so sick, we have spent so much money on making our own organic dog food for the past several years until our trainer introduced us to this dog food, we now have switched completely to this dog (over the coarse of several weeks) and she has not gotten sick once and she loves it!!!!!!",1
These clippers worked better than any others we have used.,1
"The collar malfunctioned and hurt my dog, had to take her to the emergency vet for treatment.  Poor girl. Worked good up until one day when it shorted out and went haywire. Buyer beware. I will never put a collar like this on her again!",0
"My cat loves this.  She drinks straight from the stream.  I don't know if the water tastes better, or if the fountain helps her kidney health.  I just know that if she didn't like it, she wouldn't use it.  And I've got a basement full of old never-used cat stuff to prove it.

However, cleaning this thing is a chore.  Even when using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drinkwell-Pet-Fountain-Cleaning-Kit/dp/B000NHWMGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drinkwell Pet Fountain Cleaning Kit</a>.  Despite the constantly flowing water, it still gets covered with that typical cat bowl slime.  Then when you get inside, there's some impossible to reach nooks and crannies.  And after a while, that gets real nasty.

But what are you gonna do?  The cat loves it.  So if you love your cat, you gotta put up with the hassle.",1
All three of my dogs love it.,1
"While many cats like drinking from the tub/sink faucet, this product does NOT mimic that experience very well at all. I wouldn't expect every cat to like this fountain when the water moves so smoothly and somewhat uninterestingly down the ramp. I thought the water moving would attract my cat but it is pretty hard to see the water at all. My cat was interested for 10 minutes and was done with it for good. The fountain is quiet, and yes, you have to clean it and monitor it so the pump doesn't burn out. Overall it was more trouble than it was worth. Not recommended. I would try the fountains that bubble or have the water free-falling down from the spout. At least it would attract my cat.",0
"One I finally got the unit installed, it does work well and appear to insulate pretty well against the Seattle elements.

That said, installing this unit was a total pain in the ass.  I am a very handy person and expected the install to be a simple 20 minute task including drawing a template, cutting the hole, and screwing the unit in.  this was far from reality.  First off, the template was wrong.  I had to re-cut the hole a couple of times to get it right.  It was a couple inches off on height and too wide (I had to add some wood to prevent excessive gap).  Once the hole is corrected, the passageway pieces must be cut.  getting them cut correctly also was a total pain, and getting them to stay in place with the foam insulation pieces wrapped around them was even worse.  I ended up scrapping the foam because it wasn't working then insulating the gap around with spray-in foam (can be a total mess if you are not careful).  If your time and sanity is worth anything to you, spend a couple extra dollars for a better unit and save yourself a day of being pissed off.",0
"I love these bows so much, they are absolutely gorgeous! I was abut skeptical ordering these, as I felt it might be too good to be true for the price, but these are very sturdy and well made. They come in a good amount of different sizes and I had all pairs! The heart ones, orange,and purple ones are my favorite, but I really love all of them! This company definitely has my business and I will be ordering more when possible!",1
Too small. I had to return,0
My cats will not eat this...no matter how hungry they are.,0
Absolutely my favorite bags. Perfect size for my Pomeranian dog.,1
"Decent leash but cheap plastic ""B"" symbols that will rub off in no time. It was a gift so I recommended to them to put clear nail polish over the ""B""s to protect it. I also purchased a Patriots leash on Amazon, different maker, and it was a very high quality leash with the Pats logo stitched into the weave. Much nicer than this one.",0
Only worked about 6 weeks,0
"I read the only review and decided to try it anyway. Its pretty terrible. It looks like a piece of cheap lingerie and doesn't really do anything but annoy my dog since he doesn't have a harness. Not sure it would do much with a harness, but really doesn't work without one.",0
Our cat loves it!,1
"I stucke with this product for over 6 months just thinking my cat would need a few doses for the flea population to be eliminated. I even tried applying it every 3 weeks instead of 4. It did absolutely nothing. He has DOZENS of fleas on him all the time. In addition to using this I vacuumed weekly, and brushed my one indoor cat with a flea comb several times a week. It never reduced the number of fleas on him or in the house. This made less of an impact than vacuuming or spraying the carpet. I am done with this useless product. I will never use it again and I wouldnt recommend it even to my worst enemy.",0
My dog loves these treats.  Good for dogs with allergies.,1
The flaps that go down into the window opening were being prohibited from going fully down so it did not work for me.  We were attempting to install on a 2010 Toyota Tundra pickup.,0
This harness has outlasted all others. Finally!,1
"Great product, gets the tartar off my dogs teeth as described.",1
"I installed the system, and went to test the collar they showed that they were working. But turned the power off to take the dogs for a walk and were up the block and the collar would start to beep? with the transmitter turned off. and still with the power turned off the dogs walking in the yard the collar would start to beep again with no power to the fence?",0
"Works great with my 2 litre diy co2 setup lots of very fine bubbles.  Just be aware it may take up to 24 hours to build up enough pressure to start producing bubbles, cant have any leaks in your system. It took mine about 16 hours , and if you have a leak coming from between the 2 halves of the diffuser itself like i did, just unscrew it and put a little teflon tape on the threads and screw it tightly back together.",1
Cut these in half and used for my cats.  They loved them!,1
Puppy is very happy with toys!,1
"If you're like me you probably were wooed by the low price of these tools compared to some of the more quality offerings at your LFS or online. However, don't fall for it. Eventually you're gonna want to buy those better tools so you might as well put the $20 you would spend on these towards those quality tools.

First of all these scissors are NOT sharp. I dunno why all the reviews state they are but they definitely aren't. Depending on your plants they may work but for any sort of delicate tasks you're going to have a tough time. They're also extremely wide so it won't be a clean cut, they kinda smash the plant in half. The finger holes are not rounded so using these, while not painful, is rather uncomfortable after a few minutes.

The tweezers seem like they'd be great because of how long they are. Unfortunately they are not very precise and open too wide when released. Trying to plant anything small, delicate, or in a tight area is impossible as they disturb substrate way too much when releasing and your plant won't be really set in. The only thing I've found them acceptable for is pulling trimmed leaves or shrimp molts out of my tank where basically no dexterity is required.

The only tool really adequate in this entire set was the sand flattener as it would be hard to mess that up.

So anyhow, I know this set is tempting because of the price but I really think you'll be better off buying a couple quality tools instead of trying to get everything with this set. If you're alright with spending $20 for a sand flattener and just look at the rest of it as extra then maybe this set will work for you.

Also, all of the tools will stick to a magnet EXCEPT the sand flattener. I'm not sure what material it's made out of but it doesn't stick to the magnetic strip I have in my stand to hold my tools.",0
"Pleasantly surprised at the size.  I have a ""chunky"" cat and she fits nicely in it. Easy to clean.",1
"Unfortunately, this remedy did not work for my dog. Please keep in mind that there are many reasons why a dog or cat is itchy. I've tried every shampoo, cream, spray, vitamin, oil, herb I could find, but nothing helps my little girl. My dog is a rescue and she definitely went through some bad times before we adopted her, so we are thinking her problems are emotional and only lots of love and time will heal those wounds. I know this line of natural remedies has helped many animals, so, if you can afford it, it's worth a try. The meds the vets give our fur kids are very dangerous, please be careful. Wishing your little ones the best.",0
"Wow!  This is a pretty incredible brush. I had it in my cart for the longest time, but hesitated to actually buy it because it is a bit pricey for a dog brush, but I am so glad that I finally bit the bullet. My dog used to run away when he saw the brush. Now he sits still and seems relaxed. He usually takes a long snooze right after his brush-out. It goes through his hair like no other brush I have used. My goldendoodle gets terrible mats and I have trouble getting most brushes through his hair. With the length of these pins, it glides right through. I will definitely purchase again!",1
"The first one I ordered- months ago small (black) I liked. It was decent and fit well on my 5.5lb dachshund/chi mix. The Velcro is definitely not the greatest but for the price I could overlook it. That being said I liked it enough to order another, this time the blue one. It does not fit the same. It digs into his underside because of the way it is cut/stitched. I am really unhappy because it is basically useless. Clearly there is no quality control with these products. I am very unsatisfied and would not recommend this.",0
Dog ate the teething ring in no time. Water additive was open,0
"How could we live without this stuff? I don't want to be known as the cat (pee) lady. LOL
This is instant cleaning. Spritz, soak a second or 2, then swipe clean.",1

"Great pair of Cat Nail Clippers.  I purchased these for my new 10.5 week old kitten.  My old trusty clippers that I have used on several of my cats over the last 15 years, were definitely not suitable for these little paws-just didn't cut effectively.  The new clippers (as indicated by many of the comments) turned out to be very sharp and were able to handle the small paws of a small kitten without any problem.  The bonus here if it were not enough that the clippers worked great... it was 1) the packaging which easily spells out how to use these (without guessing) along with diagrams; and 2) the direct communication you receive from the suppliers who without a doubt care about their product and the customer's satisfaction.  Feel free to ask them anything - these Vets are eager to help you with your little one's nail grooming.  It was a pleasure doing business with them, and I will definitely keep them in mind for future pet purchases.  I would have included a picture demonstrating the clippers, but my wiggle worm was just not cooperative.",1
Dog doesn't really chew on this. It's a pretty tough almost feels like straight plastic. I don't know it's strange.,0
Bought 3 of these filters and they worked well for a year. Now they are starting to leak. At first i thought it was just me after doing some maintenance and i got two of them to stop leaking but one has ruined my carpet not once but twice. Lesson learned so to the trash these filters will go and i will be looking for a better filter for my tanks.,0
"Let me start off by saying: AMAZING TANK! the tank is so quiet I can not hear anything coming from it no matter how quiet the room. I have 5 guppies living in my tank, all of which are extremely happy in this new tank. It included a night and day simulation for the tank, so your fish can enjoy a nice swim in the night light as well as the day. the filter is powerful and has kept this clean for 5 months without changing it out. the tank is made of glass, and is very sturdy. I did buy little blue bio balls to put in the filer portion to keep the good bacteria in. All in all a great investment. I paid 110 at fish cove near my house and love it. I think the 110 price is amazing for the build quality.",1
Really nice and soft with a thick padding. It is so much nicer that the ugly Costco boxes they seem to love.,1
"Each can lid has a tab to open, no need for a can opener.  I pry the tab up with a teaspoon and the top pops off easily.  It's as easy to open as a can of pop.  The food looks sort of like meat, it's not ground up.  The food has a mild scent and doesn't overpower the room - mind you, it's gone in a flash because the cat loves this stuff.  He has a soft, shiny coat, and considering cats are meat eaters, this pack seems to give him what he needs.  I've reordered this many times and appreciate the quick delivery.  It's nicely packaged and fits neatly on my counter.",1
I have not been able to attached the top to the can. Maybe my weak hands but each time I try I am just waiting the product. I will have to see if someone with stronger hands can get it on. Great idea though but I just have not Ben able to use it.,0
"This thing is cheaply made, so much so that the ends of the nylon strap aren't even sealed so they start to fray immediately.  Furthermore, the picture is highly misleading as I have a 50 pound dog and it was too small to fit her.  Spend a little bit more and purchase a quality product.",0
Just wish the type my dog  really loves was available as a non-add on product,1
My pug loves these. Great little treat for her and I know it's also helping to clean her teeth while she just likes the taste.,1
"It is a good item, very usefull. Everyone should use it when traveling by airplane. The label mentioning every detail of the animal is absolutely necessary.",1
Arrived sooner than expected. Everything looks nice. Well package. Can't wait to use them on my cats!!!,1
"*UPDATE*  this bed is getting returned immediately. I've changed my original 3 star to 1 star. I don't know what material outs being used to stuff this OR what the ""sherpa"" is but I've broken out in hives from touching it. I tried washing the cover- same result. I also have asthma and removing the cover caused me to need my rescue inhaler. I peeked at the stuffing and my first thought was ""fiberglass insulation"". I'm sure it's NOT fiberglass....that's what it resembles in appearance to me. I had intended for this to be used on our bed so my Yorkie wouldn't sleep under my pillows. She's just going to get her own pillows. This is way too expensive to be manufactured using low quality fabrics/fillers.

Buyer beware - if you have allergies, this may not be the dog bed for you. Especially if you would come in close contact with it or your dog after using it.
************************************************
I'm not sure about this purchase. The bed was shoved into a box too small. It bent the plastic rod intended to keep the top up. The rod pops out of the hole a lot.

I think the bed had an odor to it? I smelled something and the minute I put it on the floor my Yorkie started to attack it. Not in a playful way. I sprayed some febreeze on it and let it sit for several hours where she couldn't get to it. Will try it tonight. If she still reacts the same way I'll need to return it.

Aside from the rod popping out, it seems to be well made? It would be nice if this was offered in a fake fur instead of sherpa. Its not soft AT ALL.",0
"Im sad ! My cats love laser pointers this design is perfect moves great even with the motor sound which is low but the only problem is you can barely see the red dot.

"I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and sadly, learned that vets don't ever get this chance. Veterinary colleges are funded by dog food companies and unfortunately, as one famous vet who wants to change all that, Dr. Pitcairn, realized, taught to treat the problem rather than discovering what's causing it and that usually relates to the diet. In fact, a tremendous increase in dog health issues can be traced back to the time that dog food companies started...when they stopped eating table scraps and began an all-processed high grain and high allergen and unnatural diet. Even though table scraps were full of dog toxins like onions, they STILL had less health issues than their process food preservative and poor balance counterparts of today.

Funny how we wouldn't feed our kids crackers every day but feel it's okay to only feed our dogs that--high grain, poor protein, cooked out vitamins, highly processed, low nutrients...dogs who, in nature, seek out more protein.

In fact, that is how new dog food nutrition studies began. Because vets realized that wolves and coyotes in the wild brought in for treatment if hit by a car, etc do not have the health issues our INDOOR dogs have. A wolf might be old and without fleas or tartar or itching and with a glossy coat.

So vets like Dr. Pitcairn began studying the cause of pets with chronic issues or developing common issues too young and finding what things were toxic and unnatural and what helped prevent poor things in their diet.

I live in the woods and have 3 dogs and have yet to have one flea because I follow this advice. In fact, I have strangers tell me (often) that my dog's fur looks like a cat's because it's so shiny. No itching. Never grew up begging for my food because theirs is complete. (It may be hard to break this habit once begun but easy if it never starts.)

I will only feed them 3 things: a diet I make from Dr. Pitcairn's recommendations, ( I have no ties to any of these but am an activist about sharing anything good or bad for pets)  Newman's Own canned dog food, or Flint River Ranch.
Why? First of all, as part of my own studies I visited dog food plants. Actually this was like the biggest wakeup call on the planet for me.  I watched as I was told the ""brilliant"" model of putting the factories near cattle processing. When a cow is dead or dying of anything...they never determine the cause...they pick it up in a bulldozer and go take it to the dogfood plant. I WATCHED this.

How can they do this? Do you see how you rarely see the term ""human grade meat"" on dog food? They don't have to be inspected if it's dog food. There are two different levels of acceptance...people cannot eat food riddled with tumors from lesions or cancer, it's okay if dog's do. According to the government regulations.  Humans are required to eat inspected meat of certain cleanliness standards and from cows processed for this reason (I don't eat meat anyway but still....)Dog food companies are not required to have such standards.

For reals.

So if you will recall the huge outbreak of botulism a few years back with sick dogs going to vets, dying, etc that they linked to dog foods then it happened a few months later...do you remember there were only about 5 companies that were labeled as unaffected? This was one, Newman's Own was one....why? They only use HUMAN GRADE meat. Their meat is inspected. They do not buy meat from downed cattle plants so they were released from any recall or report of possible affected products. The others bought meat from across the country at these places and it was found the cows were diseased but because they never have to check to find out what they cows died from when making them into food, it was passed along. Then it happened again a few months later. Then it happened again a year later. Yes, we hear about these things when dogs die en masse. We never, however, hear about dogs that just fall ill....

But it gets worse.  You may see a list of vitamins and nutrients across the back of a bag of dog food. But due to the way meat is processed, they bake it at astronomically high temps to try to kill off any lesions, puss, etc. I""m not making this up. But they ARE required to have these in there...so what happens? They all bake off. You are left with some grains, high allergens like corn, and you are basically feeding your dog crackers and by-products of downed cattle.

So, does your dog beg and salivate when you eat meat or any dinner for that matter? Does your dog dive into the grass to try to get greens and nutrients by eating grass when you go for a walk?

There is a reason.  In nature, if you gave a human baby a banana and a bunny they would pet the bunny and eat the banana. If you gave a hungry dog the same for dinner, they'd eat the bunny first. What part of the bunny do they eat first? the stomach.  Why? This is where they get their greens and nutrients...then the meat protein. The raw bones clean their teeth without splintering.

Yet, although we are against eating an all-processed diet, dogs in spite of begging and pleading, are now living shorter lives, with the highest health issues ever due to our thinking that it's better for them because a dog food company told us so...or vets who don't have classes in nutrition tell us so. But this isn't taught in veterinary schools and dog food companies fund and provide text books etc. I didn't say this...vets say this.

That is changing. There is a huge off-shoot of vets now learning to find the issue and the cause (usually food related) rather than treating the issue alone.  And it turns out most issues are cured by a proper diet.

In fact, look at your dog treats. If you see sugar in them you will realize how many dog food companies are motivated by money. And there are lots of dog treats even TARTAR CLEANING (they say) dog treats with sugar. Why? Your dog will crave them just like people do. You may also see loads of unnnatural ingredients and even toxins such as onion powder. Milo's dog treats have these. Your dog can't tell you what is slowly hurting their kidneys. It's up to you to read the labels. Dog food is not regulated. It's up to us to do that.

The first thing you will notice about this dog food is that it looks like cookies broken a part rather than machine-made little round circles. Why? Because it it. They use inspected human-grade meat and a balance of carbs, protein, etc. that is closer to the natural diet and what a dog needs. Then they can bake it at a regular temperature that doesn't bake these out, just like you would at home. The nutrients aren't baked out. They bake it in sheets, naturally, then just break them apart.

You may be skeptical...so give it a month or two. Take a picture of your dog's fur before (dead serious) then compare it to when it has time to grow after eating this....you will be SHOCKED. We show poor health in our hair and so do they.

I can actually walk up to people at a dog event and tell them what they feed their dog. I have yet to be wrong and I do it often. I don't mean what brand but even people who think they are feeding their dog premium food like Iams have no idea it's just processed crackers marked up and grains and downed cattle.

I actually point out to people the difference. I kid you not, a family barbecue, a neighborhood ""house crawl"", a restaurant that allows dogs outside....I can walk up and tell who gives their dog table scraps (without toxins like onions or avocados) or real food, or human grade food....I just say ""what do you feed your dog?"" and I've never been wrong. Their coats are SHOCKINGLY different and shinier, the dogs aren't itching, and they usually have better teeth and gums.  I have yet to be wrong.

One lady told me how she took her dog to vets for years and it had to have steroid shots, then she finally found a vet who knew about nutrition rather than saying ""feed him expensive dog food"" and assumed that was good...and the dog was cured.

Do I work for this company? No. I am a very active Amazon reviewer who speaks up heavily, especially when it comes to pets, in all my reviews of things I love or things I don't.  My dogs thrive on this but I will say, they are not fans of their dog treats. So I just look at labels and find all natural dog treats (charlee bear brand has good ones) I have no ties to this company whatsoever except for the fact that I used to only feed my dogs food I made until a vet who was an expert in nutrition told me about this (In fact this vet ALWAYS treats from the cause rather than the symptoms first...a rarity as to how vets are taught to heal.)

this was at a time I was too busy to cook and I didn't want to give my dog just canned food even though Newman's Own is equally as good as this...

the difference in coat was striking.  I have tried a couple other brands and one of my poms always starts scratching. This has amino acids and things that treat the coat and skin and it's perfectly balanced.

Depending upon where you live it may be cheaper to buy direct. I anxiously await the day they finally get this on Amazon with free shipping but it has not happened yet. I'd get it on subscription then.

There is a difference. There is a huge difference. I've spent years studying in order to be informed and I recommend few dog foods. This, however, in my opinion, is simply one that no other dog food has ever come close to when I read ingredients and balance of ingredients and look at how it's made and what kind of meat.

If you ate artificial and processed chicken mcnuggets every day you'd fall ill too. When our dogs do people rarely suspect the dog food...they live such short lives anyway....nothing should be off balance, artificial, preservative-laden, processed, etc in their diets either so that even if they live a long life it is a full and healthy one with less arthritis, less kidney issues, less scratching etc.

I am a raving fan.",1

Neither she nor I realized that the can would contain the disclaimer ""Not recommended for cats being treated for Hyperthyroidism"".  My cat(being treated for Hyperthyroidism) needed a dental cleaning, but due to his age, he could not have it done.  The surgeon was afraid he would not wake up from the anesthesia.  So, I could not use it.  I did go back and check in the advertising of this product - no such warning was on the product description.  I cannot use it, and perhaps some future customers will also be burned.  I cannot return it due to it not being fulfilled by Amazon.  If I could give it no stars I would.",0
"I am very disappointed in this. It states it it odorless, but has a distinct odor that even we can smell. My cats must not like the smell because they will not drink their water at all if this product is in it. Not worth the money",0

"I purchased this dog stroller for an annual fundraising event that I participate in every year. It lasts about four years and in the past me and my fianc ended up carrying my two Chihuahuas and it becomes a handful with all the other stuff we are carrying. This stroller was amazing. It handled the wet grass and uneven terrain perfectly. I loved that I could have it open and they could stand up on the edge and look out or I could zip it closed so that no stray hands could get in. I love that it has two cup holders, a compartment with a lid and the basket underneath. This was everything that I was looking for. It is very easy to use and sets up and folds down in seconds. We recently used the stroller again when we went to Savannah and I would certainly recommend this stroller to anyone looking for one.",1
"These do not stay on at all, which is disappointing considering other positive reviews. I have a 30 lb corgi, and was very much hoping this would work.

Disappointing, as we really need a solution.",0

"I've had at least ten of these cooler beds (honestly, I've lost count) -- NINE of them have leaked and I've had to trash each one of them.

Each time, the seams failed -- my dogs did not claw them or chew on them or damage them in any way. At first, the company was very responsive and very good about replacing them at no charge, including no shipping -- otherwise, I certainly wouldn't have kept getting more of them (no matter how much my two Samoyeds loved them). At first I thought it must have been something I was doing wrong with using and maintaing the cooler beds, but then I found reviews by other purchasers and I know now that it's simply a defective product.

I got the same explanation that other reviewers got -- that it was because I moved the beds around too much. I knew that wasn't the cause: one was always in an oversized crate and never moved; the other was always on carpet, and I only slid that one out of the way when I vacuumed. Then they said I must have stepped on it myself too much, which I didn't. Besides, on the company's website, they showed a full-sized pickup truck driving over it. Even if I did walk all over it (which, according to the instructions, you HAVE to do to ""activate"" the foam core!), I certainly don't weigh as much as a full-sized pickup.

Around the time I filed a replacement claim for Bed #8 (yes, it was getting beyond frustrating by this time, but my dogs really loved these beds), the company told me they'd changed their technology on how the seams were manufactured, but the latest one that failed (just this evening, as a matter of fact) was one of the newer ones. Now that they've changed their replacement policy and raised the prices, I'm not even going to try to replace the latest one that broke. I give up. And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before my last surviving one fails, too. Good riddance.

The sad thing is, it's a great product for as long as it lasts, but it certainly doesn't last long enough to get your money's worth. Both my dogs love them, and I'm not sure how they're going to adjust to not having them anymore. I think the company needs to take them off the market until they can manufacture a reliable product. This is absurd.",0
Not durable at all. The arm bent and the entire bar snapped. Lasted less than 4 months with moderate use. Extremely disappointed with this product.,0
Love this litter mat! It works great and looks really neat with all the little bubbles in it. The bubbles do a great job of catching the litter. I got the second largest size and it's just about perfect with the litter box on it.,1
It fit great and was very comfortable,1
"I'm always on the lookout for a newer better leash, and this one fit my criteria.  It looked really high quality and was a great price.

When I first opened it, I couldn't believe the exceptional manufacturing.  It's an awesomely heavy duty leash with some added perks.  It's a little big for my dog, she's a medium sized breed and about 45 pounds.  This leash would be even better for a hard-pulling dog.  The spring clip that attaches to the d-ring of the collar is industrial, and the entire LONG length of leash feels like it's doubled over and stitched.  There's a really nice foam piece sewn in the handle of the leash, and that alone makes it more comfortable for walking.  No hard marks on your hands.  The best added accoutrement is the extra d-ring that can hold a roll of doggie baggies for easy clean up.  No more having to try to shove them in your pockets, you can just keep them on your leash by the front door.",1
Senior Kitty recognized it immediately as a toy and started playing with it.,1
"I feel like this company is out of business or something. They had never returned our attempts to contact them. We tried getting onto the forum to get some help from others and we couldn't gain access. The product itself is flawed as the ""stages"" are too big of jumps for most cats. Really, we ended up going back to cat litter and I'm pretty sure our cat thanks us.",0
LOVE. LOVE. LOVE these squeaker balls. Our dogs go crazy over them and by far the cheapest I can get them is on Amazon.,1
I cannot rate this as to whether or not I like it.  It's beautiful.  Unfortunately it does not fit my two dogs.  I measured according to the chart and it does not even come close.  I wish I had paid attention to previous reviews as others had the same problems.  Now they have to be returned.  Not happy with this vendor.  How do I get a prepaid return label?,0
Did not notice that these were made out of beef BLADDER!!!  Needless to say...they didn't get the SMELL out.  I have only given my dogs one each of these...I have 4 dogs...And I have thrown away the rest.  NASTY!!!!,0
This product does scatter the same as regular scoop litter. The only difference is that it feels like stepping on broken glass instead of tiny rocks. Do not recommend this product and attempting to cancel my subscription.,0
Learned that this company had been falsifying ingredients to pass their food off as premium pet food. We have a dog that has allergy issues and could not understand why he was reacting when we knew we had not fed him anything that should have caused a reaction. We learned later on the news that this company had been using other ingredients than was was listed. We changed foods and problem solved. I would give 0 stars if possible. I hope they are fined to the point where it puts them out of business.,0
"Only been able to use it twice, but wow this is an amazing leash.  I've had arms issues for the past 4 years and this has really helped them be able to be free and in a better position than before.  Love love love it so far!  Thanks for such a great idea!",1

"There is not a better product made for walking your dog. It keeps pulling to a minimal and brings your dog to attention very quickly without choking. It is the only harness I would ever use to walk my dog. I have one on hand just in case anything happens to this one. This is the second one I have had, had to buy another one because it became to small as my puppy grew. I even tried the Cesar Milan collar and this one preforms far better for my dog. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a dog who pulls or not. It is the best.",1
We use these as replacements for our Pet Convincer and have had no issues with them at all. They work exactly as intended and are easy to switch in and out of the cartridge.,1
I wouldn't waste my money.  It's an excruciating way to feed a dog and I'm sure the dog feels the same way.  Figure out a different way to slow your pet's eating down.,0

Awesome! So easy to use and really gets the under coat out! I have a really furry boarder collie mix and after using it for only about 30 minutes now my daughter says she's not furry enough anymore :) I was worried about the cheap price but I actually like it better than the furminator. Good quality and comfortable handle too!,1
Beware. I was taken to this item from my orders page when pressing buy it again button. The original order was for 6 bags at about this price plus 5.00 shipping. This is only one bag and this is an outrageous price. I returned item.,0
Perfect fit both my dogs Lilly and Gunner love them. Great for long walks and ball in the yard.  Update 10/24/2016 my dogs have figured out how to very easily slip this harness by walk backwards on it. It's is holding up well and easy to put on but now I can't trust it because of how easily the can get it off,0
"This is a nice, soft leash and I really like it. The only thing I did not like was finding the matching collar.  Didn't see one, so ordered a diff manufacturer and the reds are diff.  The leash has a more orange cast to the red and the darker brick red rolled collar. Both reds are nice, but I am a perfectionist, so it bugs me.  I was told by my groomer to get a rolled collar, as they are best.  Who knew?",1

"I like the fact that this solution claims to ""kill on contact"", is relatively inexpensive, is easy to use and is portable. I don't how well it compares to immersing the fleas in soapy water and thus killing them since they refuse to cooperate and jump in to the soapy water.
Since we have been using it it seems to be effective but it is hard to prove a negative so I can not say that this alone solved the problem but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt.
Please don't forget to spray your car seats and floor mats.
BTW: My vet says Frontline no longer works. It seems that the fleas have evolved (sorry creationists) to the point where previous products, such as Frontline, no longer work. She recommended Cheristin. It is very effective and very expensive.",1
The only food my dog will eat!,1
"Great product! We have a corgi that barks at EVERYTHING after two days of wearing this collar he only barks when the doorbell rings or the garage door opens and that's with only using the vibrate feature. Before this collar we tried a shock collar for barking, the citronella sprayer, air cans, two weeks of boot camp and a silent whistle none of them stopped his barking. This collar is great and I can tell my dog is more relaxed now that he is not barking at every single noise.",1
"ZERO STARS.  My pet parakeet died tonight in one of these.  He somehow entered in from the top and got stuck upside down.  I had to clip the plastic in about 7 places to try to get his body out.

DO NOT BUY THIS FOR A PARAKEET!",0

One cat started loosing her fur and just in general was moody. I took her to the vet twice.

I figured it was worth the shot (and since it's almost half the price of PetSmart it didn't seem like a bad deal).

It took about a month before I noticed a real difference, but now the fur is growing back and she purrs again.",1

Not really happy with the bowl it is too big and wastes a lot of his food.  Two years ago tubby was diabetic and very over weight. 23 lbs. he was on insulin twice a day.  Changed his food and quantity of food per my vet and reduced his weight to 14 lbs. he is now diabetes free.  No more insulin. Because he was a feral cat and. I have restricted his intake he gobbles his food so that he can then sneak in vet and take meijins food.  I have to stand guard until she is finished.  A lot of the time because he gobbles his food down so fast he throws it all up five mins later.  I cant say the bowl has helped at all.,0
I wish this sturdier. And my dog can squeeze out of the side.,0
Excellent and sturdy - just wish there was a door opinion - they both open the same way,0
sometimes it works ... sometimes not,0
"The red isn't red. It is pink, and looks nothing like the picture. It also falls apart rather quickly. If you don't care about the colors or durability, it would be nice though",0
Great at collecting the litter the cat takes with her out of the pan.,1
Fits midwest cage perfectly.,1
I have used Mango Pet Focus for several years & it is an excellent disinfectant for bird cages.  This review is about the quality of the product received from the seller International Coffee & Books.  The label on the spray bottle was faded out and there were splotches of mold on the bottle.  It looked like this product was old & could have been in storage for a long time.  I have no confidence in the continued effectiveness of a product that could have been several years old and might have possibly been contaminated.,0
"This is an absolutely DELIGHTFUL little sweater for your favorite dog!  The fact that there's a battery that lights up the neck is an additional fun thing!  Unfortunately, the sweater I purchased was too small for the Westie I had intended it for. We ""forced"" it on her - and it was really CUTE!!  We are exchanging it for a larger one, so there's no harm lost.  I think this is an excellent product, and it arrived before Christmas.  Great shipping!",1
"My cats love this food. My older cat eats the adult version and has a shiny healthy coat and is the perfect weight for his size. I had his ""wellness profile"" done at his last lab visit, and after two years on Chicken Soup for the Soul my vet says he is in perfect health. My Kitten has been eating the kitten version of this product since I brought him home from the shelter at the age of 14 weeks, and is a huge fan of the stuff. Vet says he has quite the little ""Buddha belly"" on him. I also give them a can of the moist canned food daily to up their fluid intake as cats are naturally prone to dehydration due to low water consumption and the moist food which vet says can help prevent kidney problems in the future (which many older cats develop). Cats go nuts for the canned food :-)",1
"These three toys are of surprisingly excellent quality for such a bargain price! Each has three squeakers. Head, tail and mid-body and my dog adores all three of them. I've paid as much for a single toy of marginal quality at the pet or grocery store.
Highest recommendation from me and Crystal!",1
Dog would not keep it on. I was very disappointed in it,0
My yorkie puppy loves the brown bone. Not the yellow so much I think its just too hard for his teeth.,1
It does not work as shown or as promoted. After a few attempts I got the scissors out and was done in no time.,0
loved it,1
My dogs really enjoy these treats.  They get excited each time I reach for the bag.  The resealable bag keeps them fresh.,1
My kitten loves this tunnel and it's fun to watch him zoom around and in it. The opening in mid-tube is a good feature too.,1
"Not only are these sheets total genius, but the people behind them are so helpful and awesome! Gone are all the tiny wadded up pieces from a lint roller. I use them on my heavy winter coats as well. Saves me a ton on dry cleaning bills. I can clean my furniture in seconds before visitors come over, no lugging out the vacuum! A+++",1
"I've used it and still constantly get fleas jumping on me from my dog. She also HATES it. If she liked it, it might work better because it would be easy to spray her before or after a walk, but as it is, eh. I used it on rugs and furniture and didn't see much of a change. I even put it on a rag and spread it on my dog in an attempt to make it less scary for her and she still freaked out and tried to rub it all off after. And it STINKS.  Like if you don't like that christmassy clove smell, don't buy it.  The smell isn't too bad for me if used in small amounts, but since I'm not really seeing results I'm not going to buy it again.",0
"Like many who want to stop putting poison on their dogs I wanted to try this product. It worked well for fleas not great for ticks BUT I discovered something really frighting in my research . According the ASPCA Garlic is very bad for dogs and shreds red blodd cells. Too bad I really liked this product.

I am going to switch to Arc Neem Protectant spray. Good for fleas but not highly rated for ticks although it may discourage second bites. I'm gonna buy a small bottle and see how the dogs tolerate it. I know staight undiluted neem oil is too harsh on animals which is why I will try their product.",0
"I bought this on the advice of my vet for my 12 year old Maine Coon cat who has been suffering from hip stiffness and occasional limping caused by a fall last year.  It worked great and he liked the flavor sprinkled on his food. But take note - due to his weight, about 18 lbs, he was to have two capsules a day based on the Cosequin directions.  Right after adding the second capsule to his food he began having diarrhea. Once I reduced the dosage back to one capsule a day the diarrhea went away. I've since learned that this is a common problem with Cosequin and similar supplements.  Just keep an eye on your cat's litter box.  My boy is now on one capsule a day and he doesn't limp anymore and his joint stiffness is much less noticeable.  Allover, a good product that has enhanced his well-being and made his mommy very happy.",1
have used this in past works good if your consitant with use.,1
"When it worked it was great.  Only lasts for about 6 weeks.  Don't buy this product. Save your money or try different make.  Really upset about this.  I liked that part of the money went for sheltered animals, then again who knows..... buyer beware!!",0
Excellent but pricey!,1
I have purchased many other Kong stuffed animals for my dog which has lasted months. This particular Kong toy did not last 24 hours before my dog was able to rip it open.,0
"I purchased this rolled.leather harness/leash for my Collie puppy (8wks). He has a chest circumference of 16"" and the small harness has a little slack where he can get his jaw under, but cinch it down and works well. He has room to grow with this harness for a bit. If your dog is full grown with a chest circumference of 16"", you'll want the XS size. If you are getting this for a puppy to train, do not leave it unattended if your puppy is an aggressive chewer (Labs), your leash may not last long.",1
"It normally takes a day or two for the fleas to die off, and most of the time it does last the full month.",1

excellent product,1
They are not hard anymore.  They have become crumbly in texture and fall apart,0
"You know, cats really aren't picky. They don't want something expensive, but they do like things that make noise and move in interesting ways. My cats love these things. I sometimes pick one up when I'm at the pet store, because they get lost under furniture easily. Even the dog gets excited when the cats start chasing this around.",1
Good product but not child proof it breaks pretty easy,1
My dogs really really really really like this food.,1
My dog really liked the product. I appreciate the ingredient list.,1
Product is thin flimsy extra large black tray that cracks and not very durable.  It is a waste of money.,0
"My daughter is an avid volunteer at our local SPCA.  She told me of the desperate need for martingale collars to replace the hated prong collars. I bought these collars and donated them to the shelter.  God bless all the people who volunteer their time to give some loving attention to these animals,who, through no fault of their own, are at the shelter awaiting new forever homes.",1
It doesn't fit for my dog. I should have buy bigger one. Size guide is kinda wrong.,0
"A must for refinishing used or old aquariums.  Definitely go with the silicone in the tube as opposed to little hand-held tubes as they will ravage your hands.  We used this in our 180 gallon with a caulking gun and while it was nerve racking (our first time doing it, of course) it turned out rather well.",1
The hardest thing to put together ever,0
This worked great. I used this on a camping trip for my Maltese and had zero issues.,1
"The first one I bought my Mastiff puppy absolutely loved and lasted about 5 months until it ripped under where the chew holds in place.  My dog is now about 115 pounds and ripped it in the same spot in less than two weeks,  it no longer holds the chews.  Very disappointed.",0
Advertised as chew resistant. It lasted less than 1 day. Definitely not as advertised. Not sure why they would advertise as such when it is NO different then any other cloth leash!,0
"Used only for special occasions , it broke the second time I used it:(  was very disappointed because it is a large collar for large dogs!",0

"I have been using Tidy Cats clumping litters for the 10 years that I have had cats. Once I tried Tidy Cat lightweight, I was not convinced. After my second purchase, I realized the distinct advantages over the traditional Tidy Cats clumping litter. I am now sold on this product. It is all that it is touted to be. It performs to my high expectations. My cat, Jiggy, had no problems transitioning to this litter and he is content using it. I can handle the containers with much ease. It generates less dust, it controls odors. I returned for exchange my supply of conventional litter for lightweight and was happy to pay the price difference for the quality and convenience. I am brand loyal and product loyal, however, I was willing to try something new offered by this brand and I am quite happy that I did. Tidy Cats Lightweight is my go-to litter, tried and true!",1

Super cute and soft... but 'Chew Guard' is a myth. Picture below is after only 10 days for a Golden Retriever.,0
"NOTE:
Below is my original review.  Since this review I have bought another bag and they were TERRIBLE QUALITY.  The sticks, many of them, were skinny as twigs.  Many of the other sticks stank and were weird shapes.  This was a ""seconds"" batch.  It's tough because I know bestbullysticks.com sells perfect sticks from their own website---but when they sell to Amazon customers---I dunno---I think the ship Amazon the ones that cannot sell from their own site due to poor quality.  I will NOT be ordering from them again.  I will spend more--there are some that are about $10 more---but at least I won't feel annoyed that I got ""seconds.""  Read my original review too--it is still helpful in making your decision.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I've ordered three packs of this exact item from Best Bully Sticks/Amazon.  When I ordered from their own branded Website, the sticks were immaculate and had a branded label.  They were all the same size and color and seemed uniform.  I got them on sale from the brand Website and so paid what I do currently from Amazon.  When I went to order more, the sale was no longer on and they were significantly more expensive.  Amazon had the same Best Bully Sticks (odor free) and the same product count for the sale price I paid.  Excellent.  However, when I received the bag it wasn't labeled, the sticks were splintered and the sizes were not uniform and seemed dryer than my original purchase.  They seemed like seconds.  But, because of the price, and the fact that my dog didn't seem to mind--I bought them again from Amazon.  This time, though the bag was again unlabeled, the sticks were uniform and of the same quality as my first batch.  These sticks do get gooey---a good thing---when your dog starts to chew them.  So, if they do appear dry or brittle, this does soften almost immediately.  I have an 8 month old sheepdog puppy and this size seems to last him about 20mins!  If your dog is a heavy chewer and a Bully Stick addict, don't expect these or really any 6"" sticks to last more than an hour--MAX!  Again, great deal as one bully stick from Petco can be 4-5 bucks!",0
"I recently adopted two 2 year old dogs. The previous owner had misguidedly used these retched things for dental care.  Both dogs had bleeding gums and massive amounts of plague on their molars and canines along with plague under the gum line requiring costly dental cleaning prodedures. The only way to properly care for a dogs teeth is to correctly brush them using an enzymatic paste, preferably followed by brushing with a chlorhexadine rinse. My dogs line up each morning to have their teeth brushed. Brushing is equated with no bleeding gums, no plague, no expensive greenies (that don't work) and fresh breath!!",0
"I purchased this light thinking it was really a 29wx2 and 36"" and it was 21wx2.  Not a big deal there, but what is a big deal is after 3 days I wanted to turn on the LED lights and they worked fine, left on 12 hours.  Turned LED lights on the next day and 1 of the bulbs does not work already.  Cheap stuff, will buy from real store next time and pay more.  Waiting for one of the long bulbs to malfunction now.",0
"I've had one of these installed for several years now, but two days ago one of my cats got his tail caught in the door. Two hundred dollars later, his tail is 3 inches shorter than it was and he's terrified of the door now, as well he should be.  As I have no other way of letting my kitties out to their enclosure, I'm planning on cutting off the bottom and putting a piece of soft brush material on the bottom to prevent this happening again. Cats shouldn't have to loose body parts because of someone's ill conceived idea.",0
"I was impressed with how easy the indoor/outdoor crate assembles.  Even better is that it is super easy to clean.  It fits nicely in the back of my SUV assembled, and folds to almost flat.  Most important, the pups love it!  Definitely 5 stars on all counts, as I own 6 other crates, and this tops them all.",1
"My cats love this. It's a multi-million dollar idea...Some wire and cardboard, coil it up, charge $2-3 and sell them to cat people everywhere. Cats LOVE this product. They will play with it until they're panting.

The coiled wire design provides an unpredictability that cats love and the cardboard ends give them something fun to pounce and chew on. I think it accurately recreates the experience of chasing a bird, fly, chipmunk, baby squirrel, or other similarly elusive prey.

Don't think twice, but definitely buy two!",1
"Our dog loves these treats.  I use them while training and disciplining him during walks to stop and wait at intersections before telling him ""ok"".  My dog weighs 9 lbs so I break each treat into four or five pieces which makes naturally makes them last quite a while.  Keep bag totally sealed or they will dry out within two weeks or so.",1
Waste of money...the hot spray treatment seemed more like just water...,0
"Had to return this after 2 weeks.  It became very wobbly, I was constantly tightening the screws. The L brackets and the screws for them, destroyed the particle board making those unusable.  I loved the design, my cats loved it too, just wish it was a bit more sturdy.",0
Goodies,1
"This leash is not very strong. It feels rather flimsy, almost like I am using a ribbon or a bow to walk my dog.  I am not using it, and it is just sitting in my pantry.",0
"This is an awful design. It was almost impossible to get it just right onto the cage. My rabbit riped the bars out when he got frustrated he couldn't get to the bottom since there was a wall in the way, even when they were clicked in. I think it was messier than my simple one on the outside of the cage since I have to reach my hand into the cage (and it was right next to the door). The pellet area is too big as well, no one keeps that many pellets in their cage at a time.",0
"I love this seat! It is very easy to install and it keeps my baby safe while he is riding in the car with me. My biggest concern was finding something that would prevent the airbag from hurting my baby if it did ever deploy and this eat is wonderful as it sits above the seat cushion raising the dog up to a safe level which protects against the airbag. I have a 3 month old, 6  pound puppy, and he has room to move around, sit, lay, and even chew on his favorite toy. Great for smaller dogs",1
"I bought this item from pet smart and I love it! It works wonderful and made my dog white, but when I bought this from Amazon, thinking the price was right and it's a product I used, so it's good. But after getting the product and using it, the container for the shampoo is correct, but the shampoo itself was wrong and switched.",0
Great quality - release button works great to quickly remove all of the hair from the brush. I've used this on my Golden Retriever-Mix and she and I were both happy with it.,1
"Your first thought might be, ""I'd have to be an idiot to believe rocks in the water bowl would stop the yellow spots in my grass:""  You'd be right.",0
Awesome!,1
My cats are picky with food and treats and they LOVE these treats! I can sprinkle it on regular food to boost their appetites and also give them as treats. Make sure to break bigger pieces so they're safe to chew and swallow.,1
"I like it because she likes it!  Being part lab and rescued from probably a ""foodless"" environment, she wolfs treats down, but this bone does take longer to finish and doesn't stain the carpet.  The size is also good, as she doesn't need huge treats-I can at least get out the door with her not being finished!",1
This heater worked great but quit working after only 4 months.,0
I am unable to cast.  I can pull the line out and my cat will still play with it.  It doesn't seem to react to the  catnip.,0
"This tray is exactly what I hoped it would be. I did not find it flimsy at all, (maybe they've improved the tray), and the sticker on the front came off easily. I only needed just a little soap and water to remove the minor spots of adhesive. It is attractive, holds at least 4 pairs of shoes, (I have 2 pairs of shoes and two pairs of boots in it, one being heavy winter Sorrel boots). As was mentioned previously by another person, it would be nice to have some rubber backing to keep it from sliding around on the floor. Otherwise, I love it!",1
My dog cut it in half in about 1/2 hour,0
"This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons. They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats. These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be ""organic"" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money.",0
i received this item with deformed suction cups. i tried to improvise all sorts of stuff just to make sure this thing will stick to the walls of my glass and plastic tanks to no avail. it always falls off after a couple of hours. i ran out of ways to secure it to my tanks so i just used it as a test tube. an overpriced test tube.,0
"Product descriptor says HUMONGUS PIG EARS. Reality was only about 7-9 in each 25 piece bag were as advertised. The balance
appeared to be from piglets. This was my fifth order from Amazon and it was the only one I've complained about. I usually
order 200 at a time and I'm aware that there will be a variety of sizes but definitely not to the degree of my last order.
I'll try one more time. First time shame on them, second time shame on me but I'll be fair.

"I ordered this leash with the same style Perri's collar and was impressed by its quality.  Fine leather with extra padding in the blue areas.  So it's as comfortable on my hand as the collar is for my dog.  It was clearly labeled as 5-feet, and my dog is used to a 6-feet leash. So I had the shoe repair shop add a foot of black leather (easy to blend around the blue padded area) and it's now perfect for walking the dog.",1
"My puppy loves Lean Treats, and I have had a great experience with them.  Past Lean Treats have been soft and easy to mold onto bones or toys to distract my puppy for a while, mold around medicine, or break apart into pieces when we are doing training. I go through them so fast, that I decided to order this 20 pack despite reading reviews that the treats were stale.  Unfortunately, the treats are much harder than bags I have bought in the past.  I have bought these at my vet and from other vendors on Amazon and received a much better product.  The treats in every Lean Treats bag I have opened from this order are hard and difficult to break apart.",0
"A must have for a bird owner! The horizontal holder makes feeding your birds millet so simple! No more trying to hang it from the side of the cage, just place it in the holder and when they have finished it, simply remove the stem and place fresh in.",1

My dog did not like the taste. Refused to eat the Lamb Rice formula.,0

Cute but the velcro is sewn in upside down so it doesn't work. Needs to be removed and flipped to properly attach to the other side. Disappointed. :(,0
"Our cat of 15 years was just recently diagnosed with Kidney Failure.

Among the other things the vet prescribed to help her is a daily dose of Pepcid and an appetite stimulant which she takes every 3 days. She's not allowed to have a lot of protein (part of kidney failure), but the vet advised a little would be OK to disguise her pills in a small bit of food. We tried everything to get her to take the pills - tuna, cream cheese, regular cheese, cream, whipped cream, ham, turkey, baby food, etc. Although she usually loves all of these things (she comes running when we shake the whipped cream can!), she would not touch them when the pill was mixed in. We tried adding the pills whole as well as crushing and mixing them. No go.

The vet suggested force-feeding her the pills. This includes wrapping her up in a towel while my husband forces her to open her jaw and throws the pill in while. I shoot a syringe full of water in forcing her to swallow the pill. Sounds pretty straight forward, but its not. Not to mention its stressful on us all. When we were finally able to get the pill in her mouth it actually started foaming!

Needless to say, we were very frustrated and didn't know what to do. Then we found these. She loves them and hasn't even noticed the pill. We purchased both the Chicken and Salmon in case she gets bored of one flavor. We're crossing our fingers that she doesn't wise up. But they have literally been a life-saver!  Thank you Greenies!",1
Not silent in any way. Amazon needs to review its suppliers more thoroughly,0
Solid product - we used it for the porch when we had our dog spayed - then we use it for the vehicle. Easy - no bounce - not flimsy - so slip.  Worth it.,1
"well it looked great but must of broke off as my cats collar was just looking old and tattered he had it for over 4years, so i got this and set to the same size. he's an outdoor cat in the country and about a week and a half of him wearing it he came home one day without a collar. now it must of got caught on something as this has a safety breakaway. but now I'm out of a collar for my cat and lost his tags but guess its good he's still around.",0
This product is not worth buying! We usually buy Kong products because they are supposed to be long lasting and durable. Our dog is 55-60lbs. He had this torn up in less than 5 minutes. Very disappointing.,0
"I purchased this to try and help with my kitty's coat. Living on the west coast its gets very dry, barely any humidity, and I think my kitties feel it. SO I wanted to try them on something that may help. Sadly, it isn't working out.
I have three cats. Two of which who eats anything and everything, and one a picky little bugger. I mixed this food with their normal food and they wouldn't even touch it. Not even with their regular food in the same dish. I put their regular food in a dish by itself and they chowed down. Sadly to say neither one of my three babies do not like this food.
I am not saying it horrible, it is just not a good fit for my three fur babies. Happy kitties, happy mommy. Sad kitties, sad mommy.
The price wasn't too bad, considering it was a add on item, I think I will go donate it to the animal shelter, in hopes that some of the babies there will eat it. I just cant throw it away knowing there are kitties who doesn't have food. :(",0
I wanted to love this but the hole for the tail and bottom is too small! My dog is an 8 lb mini doxi. If she has a BM it can not come out the hole because the hole covers her bottom. The rest of the keeper fits well so I had to cut the hole bigger and sew it so it wouldn't rip and am trying it again.,0
I bought this for my cat who has dry skin and for my older cat for her joints. The only problem is that my cats won't go near their food with this in it. I tired giving multiple smaller doses throughout the day and had slightly better results but not great and I can't then regulate which cats get the correct amount so I had to give up on the end.,0
Good,1
"The structure of the perch is fine, but unfortunately my pets don't care for the fussy cheap carpet used on this perch. I previously bought the same perch from th same seller and they used regular carpet on that one and the cats pretty much fight over the old perch and completely ignore the new one...",0
"Three Yorkies and a Shih-Tzu demand that I buy these in bulk 3-4x a year.  They demolish them with great enjoyment and have no issues with them.  I wish I could get them a wee bit cheaper though, buying so often in such bulk, though.  Highly recommended for dogs under 10#",1
"Bag arrived crushed to smithereens. Added water to it to make a paste and froze in a Kong for my dog, who proceeded to get an upset stomach within a few hours. I love Stella & Chewy's patties, but disappointed with these light air puff ""snacks."" They are dry and got stuck in his throat.",0

"I never write reviews unless the situation is extreme.  I ordered two bags of hay.  One was okay - not the freshest smelling bag of Oxbow I ever received, just okay.  Second bag is brown, musty and terrible quality.  The 40 oz. bags are quite large so this is a huge waste.  Very disappointed and wish I could get a refund.  I noticed other reviews in the last few weeks complained of the same problem - I will avoid ordering this product online in the future.",0
"I made the mistake of purchasing two of these carriers (one large size, one smaller size) for my cats.  I would never recommend them!  I transported my larger cat (she weighs 16 lbs) to the vet in the large size carrier.  While there was plenty of room for her, it was not stable enough to transport her safely.  She had torn two holes in the mesh side by the time I got there.  The vet's office is less than 3 miles from my home.  The second problem was that the bottom of this carrier did not provide enough support for my cat.  As I carried her, the bottom of the carrier bulged underneath.  I ended up not even using the handles--I held the carrier using both arms so I could support the bottom with one arm.  The third, and very dangerous, situation was:  even though I zipped the top completely, she found a way to squeeze her head out of the velcro-sealed end.  Luckily, I had her on the front floor of the passenger side and saw her the moment she stuck her head out.  I was in the middle of traffic and had to push her head back in and keep my hand on the top of the carrier for the rest of the trip.  I almost had an accident because of this useless product.  Please, please don't try to transport a cat in it.",0
My husband and I purchased this early April. It worked the first two times we used it and then never again. I'm incredibly disappointed in this product and highly suggest to purchase it elsewhere or by another company.,0

"I am seriously blown away by the effect this product has had on my dog's walking. Such a simple design but oh so effective. I purchased the small for a 19 lb Cavapoo. (Originally tried the small/medium but was much too big). I would say that the small is great for dogs in the 12-20 lb range and the width of the harness is probably 3/4 inch so perfect for smaller dog. The harness was easy to put on - the top stays clipped and easily fits over the head, and then the bottom strap clips behind the front legs. MUCH easier than other harnesses I've tried. The harness was easily adjusted while my dog was wearing it. The part that goes around the front of her chest is on it's tightest setting. I would say that this measurement is probably more important than the girth measurement unless your dog has a VERY wide girth. I did not want to tighten it too much based on concerns other reviewers had about chafing but it needs to be snug and I will only use while we are walking on leash. My dog is 9 months old so likes to sniff at everything and is very excited to see other people/dogs. So during our first walk of the day with the new leash, as soon as she pulled ahead her leash became taught, I used the command ""with me"" at the same time as the chest part of the harness pulling and she immediately slowed down. She did this a few more times but then walked 4 blocks without pulling AT ALL!!!!. It's uncanny how easily this seems to have fixed her pulling. We did not meet another dog so that will be the true test but I cannot praise this product enough. A few minor negative comments (which are all small): since the clip on the leash attaches in the front of her chest, the leash hits her upper front leg (thigh) while she walks so you feel it bouncing off her her. I did not really like the feeling of this but will deal with it since the harness helps so much. I also found her leash got twisted a lot, which was probably something to do with the bouncing off the leg (it was not twisting in my hand but at the clip where it attaches). Since she is a pup and doesn't always walk in a straight line, you have to swing the leash under her face every time she switches sides. These are all minor points and the positives FAR outweigh any negatives. Truly an awesome product. I was not paid for this review, nor did I receive any free products - I just really like this product!!",1
"UPDATE: I ended up returning these products. I was very disappointed with the quality and the short string. I found that in order to play with your cat with this toy, you had to bend over to use it. I am 5'4"" and this did not work for me. Even much shorter people probably will find the string too short. If you are a little person, or a child, this toy might be an ok length for you. It does not work well if you are an adult height.

This cat toy would be 4 stars if the string was longer. Oh how I hate wand toys with short strings!! Not very useful. I will probably cut the toy off of the end.",0
aok,1
"I like the weight and construction of this product, but for some reason my kitty prefers her old worm out post. OH well that not the manufacture problem.",1
Given as a gift. No complaints.,1
"Wow, this stuff really works! My tank was a little cloudy, the next day I woke up to a crystal clear tank.",1
"I placed the order for orange which I was told there were only two left so I needed to order now. I wanted orange because that is my moms favorite color. I was given a call a week later from a lady you could hardly understand what she was saying. She told me the orange was sold out and asked if I would like another color instead. So I told her I would take teal. I never received an email or phone call. So after a week I tried the tracking number from the original email. UPS told me they would tell more about my delivery once they received the package from the supplier. So I called the company back and spoke with a lady who said the order was never placed, but she would place it today and the package would go out today or tomorrow. I waited another week and my package had not arrived. So I called them back thank goodness I had saved the number because they don't list a number anywhere I could find. So I asked the guy on the phone and he said yes the teal one shipped out yesterday. Well the package arrived and looked to be in good condition and provided a sample of material on the outside to show me the color was teal. So I wrapped the package and my mom opened it on Christmas day to find out the color was actually bright green. Im glad my mom could live with green because I really did not want to deal with the company anymore. I personally will not be buying anything else from the company because there customer service is not good and even after they changed the order I stilled did not get my second choice. The product itself looked ok, but it is very light Im worried the poles will bend. Ill find out more after my mom uses it a few times.",0
The petstore told me this was one of the best and I definitely agree.  The Amazon price is the best I have found.,1
Was on horse less than one month and the leg straps tore off. I guess this product wasn't make to put on the horse and turn out to pasture. Will not purchase again.,0
"Pads do NOT hold my puppys accidents. Pads leak through to the floor, I have had to double up on pads to prevent the urine from ruining my floors.",0
Bought this to keep our 2 cats off the counter and only worked for a very short time period... Both cats figured out how to jump over it / avoid it and if it did go off they weren't even phased by it... Sighhhh.,0
"My 8lb dog really likes these. He hates his harness and he'll only come to me and let me put it on for something ""really good"" before now he would only do it for the little blue buffalo bacon strips but he'll come running for these!",1
Perfect!,1
Did NOT hold up at all....VERY disappointed.  my dogs didn't even have a chance to play tug a war with it. One dog just SAT there and was able to tear it apart within a very short period of time.,0
Extra large collar was still to small for my Golden. Very disappointed,0
"why oh why can't they make this stuff unscented? it smells so unbearably strong and lingers forever. the  place smells like a rest stop bathroom now. i will try and find an alternative somewhere. sorry i purchased this big bottle, since the spot clean machine came with a small sample size in the box.",0
"I believe the cat's are enjoying it.  They got tired of different flavors, but they seem to be willing to come back to this one about every 3rd day. The product was as advertised and arrived a bit late due to weather conditions which cannot be helped.",1
"I received this product 2 days later as promised. I opened the box to check all was there. Everything was present. When I looked at the steps, the upper step was cracked all the way through. I was able to repair the step with 3 long screws drilled through it. It works but this is not what I paid for. I expect a quality product no matter what the price. For what I paid I am not going to go through the hassle of returning it. I am deeply disappointed with amazon for the poor quality.",0
The foam did not expand all the way.  Very disappointing and difficult to ship back because it was half expanded :(,0
Play pen and extensions work great easy to move and assemble,1
"It's a bubble magus, nuff said.",1
"The tan top layer is like a thick, soft honey comb that allows the litter to drop through onto the dark brown waterproof bottom panel.  No way a cat can walk across this and scatter any litter on the floor.  BEST purchase I've ever made!",1
My dog was able to take it off after 5 minutes.,0
Runs small and is uncomfortable for the dog. It's really cute but its not designed well and it is not easy to put on/take off for either the owner or our little pup. Just went back to using the old one.,0
"no complaints. The product is exactly as it was advertised. Also, it shipped quickly. Would recommend as a product that works perfectly at a great price.",1
"Our 7 year old Border Collie is very active, a lot of walking, bike riding (well, I ride, he trots) and especially gets a workout with a frisbee or soccer ball. He's slowed a bit this last year, and then started having a limp, especially when he first gets up and about after a nap. Sometimes it would continue all day, so we cut back the exercise.

A guy I met walking my dogs told me about this stuff so I bought it, level 1 as he's about 40 lbs. This was 4 weeks ago and we give him a half tablet morning and eve.

As there's no 'control' I can't say for sure this did the trick but, for one thing it had no ILL effect and he has been back to his 4 legged self the last week or more. So I will continue it going forward and would say for $30 versus the $150-200 we would have spent at the vet on xrays etc to be told, nothing is wrong - it's a bargain.

Dec 30 update - I have to believe it was these pills, he's been 100% with very few exceptions ever since we started him on this product. Highly recommend to dog lovers with ailing pets.",1
"I used it for a year or two, but finally upgraded to one that was much more stable. This one scooted all over the floor. It was pretty wobbly. Will use it as a plant holder.",0
I don't really like the way they work. I prefer the original clickers,0
Gentle on my girls ears and the girls love the smell!,1
"It came wrinkled, deformed, and shorter then 22 inches.  The pad is very thin and the fur on the fabric is somewhat sparse.  I later bought a different pad from the pet store that was cheaper and much better quality.",0
"As a ferret owner with three ferrets, one who has one of the most common cancers from sweets like this garbage in a tube(thanks to his previous owner) do not buy this. Feed your ferret freeze dried meat as a treat since they are OBLIGATE CARNIVORES. If you want to spend $3000+ on vet bills to get you ferret back to a somewhat healthy state, then by all means feed this. This causes cancer and seizures. Look up a YouTube video then throw this away.",0
"Not for tough chewers. It lasted less than an hour, before being ripped apart by 1 yr old retriever mix dog. Another hour of fun destroying ball and fabric... meh.",0
"My chihuahua loves it. He even like to sleep in it... If I leave the back entry open,,, He will jump up in it...!!!",1
"I love that you get so much tubing for the price, I cut it in half and half one piece hooked up to my sponge filter and am saving the other for the ten-gallon I'm starting next month!",1
Do not buy this item. I will never order from these people again. I waited a whole month to get it then it doesn't even work the way it's supposed to. It corrects inside the boundary and does nothing outside the boundary,0
"They don't stay on my dog's feet, so they're pointless, but cute.  They come off too easily.",0
"Do Not Buy....The bristles are to sharp and the cat hair gets clogged up in between the bristles..after a couple of weeks of use while cleaning out the cat hair from the bristles, the bristles went out of place from the groove and won't go back in place..so its not as effective as before..",0
Awful ripped within mins.,0
"I love these, when I was away from the home and had cat sitter for the cat, it did what it was suppose to and he only used his littler box.  Great item - it was exactly what it said it was, came in great packaging, and I was very pleased with my purchase.",1
They work! The cleanup is easier and faster.  My husband and I recommend them for a multicat household like ours.,1
"We bought two leashes. One is holding up great, the other will need to be thrown out. The inner cords at the center of the leash have popped out and I am concerned about the structural integrity at this point. At this price point, I was hoping for more.",0
"When I first got this leash I thought it would be great. I had read some reviews which were very mixed and now I know why. This leash worked sort of OK for about a dozen times, even though I couldn't stop a dog quickly because the tabs on top were so stiff and didn't glide. And I bought it to help out a friend with her dog who can't walk very well, so I'm not using this everyday. But then the other day one leash extended and wouldn't retract while out on a trail. Not good since now I had no way of bringing that dog in. So I tried to open it up and see if I could fix the retraction, but after unscrewing all the screws the handle would not separate, so no chance of trying salvage the leash. If this was $10 I wouldn't be writing this but it's almost $40 and pretty expensive for only about 12 walks. I think the maker should pull this from the market and fix these problems. NO ONE SHOULD BUY THIS IF YOU CARE FOR YOUR DOGS.",0
"The most true to form bed I've ever purchased. Cover is very soft, bed very sturdy. My dog doesn't want to get off of it! He is almost 10 and has never slept so well. Thank you!",1
"It's always a good sign when I'm pouring the food from the bag into a bin in the kitchen and the dogs elbow each other trying to eat from the bin. I usually mix 2 kinds of food and, unfortunately, found that my black lab will pick through the food bowl and sling other brands across the room to get to this kind.",1
The product was messy and it was too soft to work as designed (like a deodorant stick).  I ordered some of the roller ball licking treats at the same time and I like them much better.,0
My little dog tore a hole in two of these in three days.,0
Returned this one as it was incomplete.,0
our dog loves all the squeaky things and it takes him much longer to get them all out b/c they are all stitched up separately,1
my dogs love them,1
"I can't believe I waited so long to get one of these! It's been in my cart forever, and finally I just decided to get it. I have a 65-pound German Shephard, and a 45-pound Norwegian Elkhound (if you don't know the breed, they have some of the thickest undercoat out there). This rake worked WONDERS. After about 5 minutes of brushing my German Shephard, I had easily 6 huge handfuls of fur...that would have taken 20 minutes to get with the brush I was using. My Norwegian Elkhound should blow her undercoat soon, and I imagine this will make that process infinitely easier. If you have a thick-furred dog, this is the perfect rake!!",1
works great!,1
"I guess the first question is does the scooper make the task easy enough to justify carrying this thing around. For me, the answer is a resounding NO, but your mileage may vary.

=== The Good Stuff ===

* It is a clever design, and folds up into a roughly 13"" x 5"" x 4"" envelope and weighs 12.2 ounces. Extended, it is 27"" in total length, about right for someone of average height.

* The handle has a squeeze bar, which opens the jaws when pulled. Releasing the handle allows the spring to snap the jaws closed. There is no mechanism for attaching a plastic bag.

* The scooper is built out of a hard plastic with a shiny finish. It is relatively easy to clean under a garden hose.

=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===

* I am not sure I understand the usefulness of the folding function. It makes it smaller, but there is no obvious way to carry it in the folded configuration. Even worse, when folded, the handle is right next to the ""business end"" of the scooper, not exactly a pleasant thought.

* There are a few nooks and crannies in the scooper mechanism, making ideal spots for ""stuff"" to collect.

* The mechanism isn't as smooth as it should be, and occasionally sticks. This is just one of those products that I want to work flawlessly.

=== Summary ===

To be honest, I'd rather just carry bags and scoop things up the old fashioned way. If you are worried about the sanitary side of things, I'd rather carry a few disinfecting wipes instead of this scooper.

I received this as an evaluation sample. I have no interest in the company or any of its employees.",0
like it. it gives out birds more space compared to their last cage,1
Low quality. My tiny dog tore the head portion of this toy within minutes of play. It's a chew toy and couldn't stand up to chewing even for a small amount of time.,0
Works well..as with most German items...,1
"don't know if it was my type of dog, or that I didn't have enough diffusers around the house, but it didn't seem to make a difference with the 3 months supply of goop I also bought. Too expensive to keep trying and not see a benefit.",0
These are useless.  Put these in my dogs toys and they don't work within an hour.,0
Our dog loves this food. As soon as we open the bag he comes running. The little pellets are perfect for his size.,1
Excellent product.  My dog loves hers and we love the safety.,1
i bought this 2 months ago and somehow my dog ended up chewing pieces off .  i was always under the impression that kong toys were industructable.  i have a jack russell so she is not a large dog. we ended up throwing it away....wouldnt recommend this,0
"My dog's favorite food.  Only 4 stars because of price point. It should be at least 10-15 cents cheaper (each container) for the amount of food it contains...no matter which store I buy it from.  I normally pay 70-72 cents in Walmart, Target, and PetSmart.  It should be 55-65 cents for the little food that it comes with.",1
"The food pellets are large and what I imagine you would feed a dog.  My two cats (11 years old) will not eat it.  They tried, but I found chewed pieces in and around the dish.  I recommend Royal Canin Indoor Mature 27 instead.",0
No adhesive was included in the kit. I would not recommend and would not buy again.,0
"Dogs will not eat this. Sorry, we tried.",0
"My puppy loves this bed- it is very soft and cushy. It is a good value for the size and quality. My only complaint is it is a bit of a pain to wash. I wish the stuffing on the bottom was contained so that the whole cover could be removed in the wash. I washed with the stuffing and it was fine, just bulky to fit in a top-loading washer and a bit extra work to put the bolster back in. Otherwise a great bed!",1
"The wooden part of the cage is ok, the parts do not stay in place. The cage is very thin. It was bent the first day my dog was in it.",0
The collar looked great at night but it died after 3 weeks of use on our 12 year old Husky that lies around mostly thinking about his good old younger days. . The switch/battery power supply looks very flimsy. Made in China. This collar cost twice what others cost but the quality is not there. It looks like it should cost about 8.00 instead of over 21.00.,0
Metal frame broke within a month.,0
I really like these. I wish my dog loved them more. He eats them but he doesn't get excited about them. He would prefer a meaty treat or raw carrots and apples.,1
"cute idea, my fish didn't use it, as well as the wire had rust spots after being in the tank for 1 day. Maybe a better quality one would work better..",0
These are truly top of the line shears.  They are smooth and sharp as a razor.  The charm fell off within a week but i would have removed it at some point anyway.,1
"The dogs totally dig this as a nutritional supplement to their kibble. The cats on the other hand will actually walk away from it. I mean, they eat bugs and they won't touch this.",0
I ordered online for convenience. 2 different kinds of screws are needed for assembly. It came with 2 of the same. Now I will need to go to try to find the proper screw. So much for convenience.,0
Leaves streak marks as you trim.  You have to go over the same area several times in order to remove the streaks (railroad tracks) making it longer to finish the job.,0
It was a gift,1
Ball is very hard plastic- difficult for dog to carry- no grip. Dog doesn't care for it.,0
Yes all was good,1
"This collar works great with the pucks, this one and the others that I have. However, I was expecting it to also work with the PetSafe Yardmax ""invisible"" fence, and it didn't.  The original collar that came with the fence works with both, so yo cansee why I assumed this one would. So, I have to be careful which collar I have on when, but they do look quite different. If you are only using the pucks, this will work great for you",1
"This heat lamp stopped working within the week..
I have bought many heat lamps for my Sulcata Tortoise, and they usually last at least 5-8 months. Would not buy this brand again,",0
Petsafe's magnetic cat door is terrific,1
"Although I have 2 cats, I bought this for my rabbit. He LOVES to play in the crinkle end! He is entertained for hours as he tears it apart & even creates his own openings on the sides. If only they were indestructible since I find myself replacing it once a month.",1
My kittens have warped the frame after less than a months use. It didn't fit the way it was supposed to on the door and  has caused damage to the inside and outside of the door. It is not very stable and would need a random screw somewhere thru my door if this is going to  last any longer.,0
"Using these Super-Absorbant underpads saved me from having to change mom's sheets several times a day.  They absorbed small and large accidents so that I only had to change the underpad, not the entire bed!",1
The bulb only works for two days stay away from that bulb it doesn't last past two days my advice is this is a bad brand,0
I LOVE IT AND SO DOES MY DOG!!,1
"Didn't use it, too hard to use. Plus, if you have animals it is dangerous",0
"This is one of the best items I have gotten for my dog since adopting her 3 years ago. She loves sitting in the seat in the car! Right away she knew this seat was nice, and did not try to get out at all. Very comfy for her, she loves to rest her chin on the edges and sleep. She is more likely to sit still in the seat unlike before where she was getting up all the time I turned on the blinker.

Some reviewers commented on being unhappy with the building material quality, but I think it is fine. Very solid, although built with foam, perhaps the other reviewers were expecting luxurious down feathers? I do not know, but this seat is great!",1
"very good quality and worth the price. However, my kitten is still too young to climb it. guess she'll figure it out later.",1
gave this to my neighbor kid that looks up to me because i am a Veteran. Great quality and the smile on his face was priceless.,1
My Pom loves these treats.,1
"These arrived as powder, not flakes.  Tried feeding a few of the larger pieces a couple times.  The fish were reluctant to eat them and the flakes rapidly disintegrated and turned the water murky.  In the trash they went.",0
"Easy to set up, just plug in and set distance. If you have a lot of acreage it would be very simple, otherwise you have to spend a little time tweaking where the boundaries should be and where you want the transmitter. Once we got it set up and the flags placed it only took two walk arounds and our dog knew the boundaries. We have her set on the lowest voltage which is very mild( I could hardly feel it). So far so good anyway. The only bad thing is the size of the transmitter on the collar. I have a terrier mix that weighs 20 lbs and it seems so huge on her. She doesn't seem to care and still runs like crazy fetching things within the area. I would highly recommend this product from what I have experienced so far.",1
Arrived very quickly!  My dog loves this toy!  She is prone to destroying any toy that she receives in a number of hours but this one has lasted at least a couple of weeks!,1
good stuff,1
Great price for this product.,1
Good!,1
My dog loves these!,1
Excellent product. Arrived in time. My dog loves when I use this on him. I definetly would recommend this product.,1
I was worried because of the price of this cone for my dog and the fact that it was shipped for free.  The cone was good quality and came much sooner then they had said.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews this does run on the small size. That's why I gave it 4 stars.,1
"Makes my cat puke. Any food that makes you or your fury friends puke is bad food.
Why is there food coloring and sketchy preservatives in cat food ?
The only use I have for this ""Good life cat food"" is fertilizer.",0
"These definitely don't smell of catnip.  My cat freaks out over any brand catnip and catnip toy, but she had zero interest in these.  She didn't even sniff them as though there was a hint of smell.  Threw them away within an hour, might as well have thrown my cash straight in the trash.",0
GOOD QUALITY,1
"This is an amazing value and goes beyond my expectations.  I bought it looking for a dog stroller with a removable carrier that rode high and a bottom shelf for purse or packages.  This one is packed with bonuses.  The stroller frame is sturdy with double front wheels and wheel locks, and even a beverage holder.  It's very maneuverable.

The carrier doubles as a shoulder bag, straps are well made and sturdy.  The designer pattern is also trimmed very nicely with braid, giving it a rich look.  It has a removable bottom pad - great for cleaning up ""accidents"". It has removable arched supports so it can stand up or fold down.  I'll probably take them out for shoulder carry.  Both ends zip open, but there's also a quick ""escape hatch"" on one end with an 8""w x 7""h drop-down door.  The other end has a pouch for leashes, treats, etc.  Good quality rubberized mesh provides air on both sides and the top. My dog can ride with the top open and his head out or closed in but with side views.  This is a classy item at a good price.",1
made in China....not really clear in the description....kind of tucked away,0
"Product is excellent, and has some of the best ingredients out there. My cat was exhibiting early signs of diabetes, so I started doing some research and began learning just how harmful some ingredients found in cat foods were. This brand was the healthiest I found, at a price point I could afford. Real meat, and quality ingredients.",1
I've relied on these for years as convenient training treats.,1
Fit's so nicely on Gabi & Diva,1
The Pet Tag Silencer is great. My dog loves to shake her head especially late at night. I now longer am startled out of a deep sleep. Thanks!,1
"My cat is picky so I can't tell if it's good! Very good ingredients, though!",0
"This is one of those ""too good to be true"" things I purchased. $20 for a little tent for the dog so he can catch some shade when we're all outside? Perfect!

No.

I got this in the mail, pulled it out of the storage bag and voila - little tent. Hooray! After 10 minutes of trying to coax my dog into it using freeze dried duck treats, I decided I'd pack it up and put it away for now.

""Fold down each side until it's flat. Then twist each side in opposite directions.""

After several attempts to get it back in the bag, the tent was ruined. It looked like a drunk person sat on it. So now, not only can I not get it into the bag, but it's no longer usable. I can't even send it back because I can't get it back in the packaging. It went in the garbage. Buh-bye, $20.",0
"Doesn't go together as expected, one side is warped, has a gap between pieces on one side.  Doesn't look so good, more important not sure that I will trust this to support my little ones.",0
"It works great. My dogs love it, and it helped freshen their breath really well, and they had some bad breath, Lol. All in all, really great product, and you can use as a treat to train as well as.",1
"Excellent tag and very fast shipment. I'm ordering another one today, for another kitty. Thanks so much!",1
"Cat hated the hat, but that's not the costume's fault - the cat just has a bad attitude.",1
Cats love it.,1
worth buying! I have two medium sized dogs weighing up to 15 pounds and they loved it. Such a great quality and I would recommend anyone to purchase this!,1
"Way too small.  Fits one of my cats like a glove, and another not at all.  Just ordered a 4 way tunnel made for children that should be a big improvement.",0
"I didn't really need this but when I purchased it, I found myself creating recipes just so I can use it. It is the perfect weight, and it makes cleaning a breeze.",1
"This product is a miracle! It stops unwanted doggie behavior painlessly and without frightening your dog. What could be better? I've used it on 2 of my 3 Basset Hounds. One for barking and another for chewing on blankets. In both instances, it worked like a charm. And the dogs are now becoming conditioned to the sight of the can so that pretty soon I won't have to even spray. This should render obsolete those barbaric shock collars as well.",1
"it is easy to start. however no suction power, barely can lift gravels.  It is not useful for cleaning purpose. i won't buy it.",0
"The clip for the dispenser broke the first time we used it. The bags are smaller and thinner than what we are used to. We have a 50 lb lab and if she produced waste any bigger than what she does, the bags wouldn't be big enough. The only thing I liked about this order was the price but I won't buy this again.",0
I wish I would have bought three of the other style vs these this style sits too close to their eyes and they are too confined with them on. They won't get used.,0
Very nice carrier!,1
"Dog crate was really easy to set up, has some nice features with the three openings and the two pockets to put things in, but the quality is not very good. We are on our second outer shell. This was due to the first one having zipper problems and when I contacted the company about this, they were totally unwilling to help at first. After sending them several emails, the very best they could and would do for me, was to send me a new outer shell at no charge, but I still had to pay for shipping. Now, this was after several emails and practically begging them. Because at first they were just going to charge me full price and shipping. Though I went ahead and did this, I was very disappointed that they were unwilling to stand behind there product that was less than 6 months old and useless due to the zipper on the door being broken. If you look in there description, it very clearly states, and I quote ""Product Quality Guarantee, 100% Money Back Guarantee, Customer Satisfaction Guarantee"". When I asked them about this, they stated that was only good for 30 days... Mind you, I was not asking for a refund, I just wanted an exchange. So, even after agreeing to pay the shipping and receiving the new outer shell, though it works... the quality and fabric is not tough at all, though the zippers are ok thus far, the fabric has a small rip on the top, so thankfully we can still use it for now, but I already know that they won't replace it unless I pay for it. Doesn't everything come with atleast a one year warranty with??? Well, not this crate!!!",0
My cat snubbed it. It's obviously not for cats but for tea. .yet it's listed a's a cat product.,0
I have tried other spot on treatments and Advantix II is the best. My dogs have not had any side effects and it really works. I treated and bathed them over and over with other treatments until I tried Advantix II. Now I will used nothing else.,1
"Cute! Not to girly for my 80lb male Dobe. His neck is 17"" ordered a large and it fits great. Nothing has fallen off and it is nice and full looking!",1
"I hate it because it arrived broken, and to get a replacement or refund I have to return it.  It was $17 - not worth my time to take it to UPS or the post office so I'm tossing it.  Bad quality control.  I have no idea if it would work and I probably won't find out.",0
They don't make it any more...,0
"TINY! Not for a large cat, and definitely not for $35.

However,  he can't be left untethered or he's all over the place and I don't care for standard belt tethers as they either allow to much or not enough movement. This little ""booster"" is the perfect solution. He's up front with me (cause I like him there:), safe and securely latched into a comfy little tote, and he is as happy as can be looking at everything and poking his nose out of the window.  And, since the booster is elevated, I can tuck my purse and other items under it. Got my seat back -- bonus!
Fit: Perfect for a 13lb Jack Russell mix, without offering too much space. He can curl into a ball or stretch and lounge a bit with his head over the edge. Or, as he prefers, he can sit up and check out the world. He loves it. I love it. Hope y' all love it ;)",1
Love it!,1
"I love it for pairing with my HS prong collar but my dog's neck is between sizes. I got the 12"" like the calculator on the leerburg website recommended, but it slipped down to the base of his neck within a minute instead of staying at the top like it is intended to, and could be slipped over his head. I exchanged it for an 11"", which was sent to me rather quickly, and it seems a bit tight. It's difficult to clip on and doesn't have much extra material when pulled on like it should, but I can fit two fingers under it, it stays at the very top of the neck, and it can't be slipped over the head. I guess a tad bit too small is better than too big when preventing an aggressive dog from bolting if his prong collar comes off.",1
This crate mat has no cushion at all and smelled like really strong ammonia-like chemicals when I received it. It was awful and I had to wash it 3 times and let it sit in the sun before it began to fade.,0
"These used to be the""better"" pads and cost $10 more than the thinner kind.  Now they cost $15 more and are Much thinner.  They're in no way thicker than the less expensive pads. It was beyond a waste of money to get these; it was insulting.",0
"This product promises a lot and does not deliver. First of all, it does not assemble easily. The stabilization poles are kind of like tent poles, however lack the flexibility in order to bend it and insert it into the holes.",0

"I've had this leash for about 3 months now.  I purchased it for my 75lb pit bull because it's rated for 100lbs and has a nice big handle to grab onto.  Today, it broke.  There is a plastic piece where the cord connects to the lanyard! This piece broke, my dog got loose and bit someone.  This is not an issue to be taken lightly.  Buyer Beware!",0
"I purchased this collar and matching leash along with a float coat and boots for my dog, all the items fit great and are very good quality. My springer appreciates the finer things in life and he loves to look good in his Ruffwear on the street, in the field, or in the water. He gets compliments wherever he goes.",1
I bought this for my cats expecting it to resemble how we would aim and move a laser light it didn't. My cats were more distracted by the noise of it spinning than the actual light itself. Even if she had played with the light the slowest setting is way too fast.,0
"This blade has never worked. It does not cut and, unfortunately, I found this out after the return period had expired. Junk. Not worth two cold hot dogs.",0
"The loops of the handles on this leash are *way* too big- and the traffic handle is a little too low. It will work- but I won't purchase it again or recommend for a friend. The lower handle would be ok maybe for a tall dog, but any shorter type of dog (or tall person) it is almost pointless because you will be choking them the entire time you are using it. Only thing I can use the lower handle for it to clip her to the register at the pet store with it. Quite bummed. I've seen much better ones.",0
My dogs seem to really like the taste of this stuff. It has helped my Pekingese with his dandruff.,1
Great product-my cats love it!,1
"This item does not look like the one in the photo presented here. The one in the photo looks like a spider, yet the one I received has very short legs that are all overlapped on top of one another and I cannot adjust them. It basically looks like a brown, oblong item with feathers attached to it. I am disappointed that the photo is misleading. The seller needs to update the photo so that the customer knows what they will actually be receiving. It's not worth the price I paid for it, although my cats will still play with it as they will play with anything.",0
They are exactly what was already in our pets cage and was glad to find them since the ones in there had quit working!!,1
"I have a pug and boxer mix who is prone to ear infections, this cleanser just did not work out at all for him. It had such a strong perfume smell that was overwhelming. Also, the minute you tip it to pour it into the ear canal, it comes pouring out and deposits way too much into the ear. My dog shook his head all throughout the day after I used it and seemed to be uncomfortable.",0
"I have ordered millet spray several times through Amazon though never from you.  I though I'd take a chance because you were a few dollars cheaper than the supplier I had gone to before.  It was a big mistake.  The quality of your millet spray was terrible.  At least 30% of what was shipped was broken, shredded or simply crumbs laying on the bottom of the box.  It was an absolute mess and a huge disappointment.  I ended up losing much more than I  thought I was saving.  It won't happen again.",0
Zero impact.  Same problem with or without this.,0
"Unfortunately the twirl piece is extremely large and VERY heavy for a cat wand toy. It doesn't stretch or flow, and is extremely hard to use. My cat never played with it, and she's a big player. I kept it for a while but it eventually tossed it as it took up a lot of room and was of no interest to my cat :/ I will say it was very high quality so it was made of good material, and safe, just not very user friendly on my end, and not very enticing on my cats end.",0
Size was way too small,0
Our Doxie always barks when someone try to get close to me.  He is my K -9 baby!!!,1
was two small for my dog by weight.,0
My cats love it but it started to tear only after 1 week of use. Now the metal ring is jutting out of end of tunnel and is unsafe for my cats to use.,0
I have a long hair Ragdoll & the FURminator combs off her hair with a breeze. I only wish I would have gotten one sooner...,1

They don't work! We still had to dip the dogs after bathing them. They were covered in fleas.,0
Harpo my pet rat sleeps in this every day. He seems to really love it and he hasn't been able to crew through it yet,1

Terrible gate and this piece did not fit. Returned it and got another suspension gate from them that does not work either. Will not buy another from them.,0
The ITEM (Whal clippers) was defective. The blades were crooked and other parts were broken. The Replacement ITEM arrived scratched up and was obviously used. The ITEM does not work as well as I hoped. I would not recommend.,0
My husband had just a few trial and errors with assembly but it works really good and my cats love it. You can adjust the amount of water that comes out for the timid cats. The hose was plenty long and you have to screw the tank on just right to prevent overflow. Good product.,1
This is a great all natural soap that deters fleas. Dog is fine with it and has shiny coat. Beats chemical use for certain! Soap is well made and lasts a long time. Well worth it.,1
Horrible. Has small plastic piece which broke immediately. Is not strong enough as a clip and should be better constructed.,0
Just no,0
Decent tank but was cracked on arrival,0
awful quality craftsmanship and awful smelling-- my dog refused to enter this china-made stink bomb!,0

"I received this product at a discount price in no way shape or form does it reflect my review . My unbiased opinion is just that, please if you have any questions about this product let me know and I will be more than happy to help any way possible!
It came quick with no problems at all in the mail which is always a plus when your ordering online! They are bigger than expected and going have to be cut down for my Yorkie's! I do like on the cardboard its on has velcro so they don't just fall of which is a plus since I won't be using that many (Only have four puppies) . The only down side is the inside is stiffer than I like and that worries me that it might rub them some because they move so much, not creating a big problem though because it's not hard. If you have any questions about this product please feel free to ask me and I will do my best to help any way possible!! Thank you for taking the time to read my review! :)",1
This is an absolute waste of money - I have a 2100 gal pond and spend a lot of time cleaning the filters - I got this in hopes that it would reduce my labor.  Well it came on time all neatly packed BUT before I would put it in my pond I thought it  best  to follow a professional advise - which is to wash the pellets first - so after carefully putting a pound into the mesh bag (WHICH BTW arrived INSIDE OUT and it took a major effort to evert that- really bad)  anyway after washing SIX times in a 5gal bucket out in my garden - I just kept getting black water.  NOT good. am so glad I did not put it directly into the pond -  yeah. Please don't bother with this.,0
My puppies love this bed.  They can carry it around to where they want to lay.  It's very washable and holds its shape even through the dryer.,1
Great dog food!,1

"It works ok but the smell of perfume is overwhelming and once it's gets used by the cats it's not perfume smelling anymore at all, it is like it enchnces the feline urine or something. I wouldn't use again unless I was in a pinch.",0
"My dog loves it. It is noisy, but she absolutely loves working it to get the food out. I actually feed her whole meal to her in this. She is a fast eater, and this slows her down so she isn't finished in 30 seconds flat. She's an aggressive chewer, but has not chewed this toy, she does pick it up by the yellow piece and carry it back to the middle of the floor when it gets stuck in a corner. One warning if you have floor vents, keep an eye on the toy while your dog is playing so that you don't end up with dog food in your vents.",1
"I got this for my older cats based on vets recommendation (type of food, not necessarily this brand/flavor).  My cats love tuna, salmon and mackeral (people food---fresh and/or canned) so I got the salmon flavor to try first.
I put it out in the morning expecting howls of delight.  What I got was two cats who sniffed and refused to even taste this stuff.

I left it out all day in hopes that hunger would drive them to at least try it.  They went all day without a taste.

I gave up and put it in my labrador's bowl (in other words into the garbage disposal...LOL!). He sniffed it and turned away from it.  Left it there for two more hours and he would not touch it. In nine years I have never had my lab refuse to eat something, and have been grossed out by some things he has chosen to eat.
Went to pet store after this experiment and got five other brands of fish based food.  Both cats ate all other brands even though they would much prefer real fish (based on how slowly they ate the canned vs how fast they scarf the real deal).

Wish I knew what was in this that grossed out my pets!",0
Works great.  After installing all the fin and tail rot healed on my fish no meds and the fish are healthier.  Wish it had greater capacity. My tank is 150 gallons,1
I guess you do get what you pay for. Had clip on my basset hound's collar with her three tags. Not even a week later it is bent beyond repair....she's not a high energy dog and we clipped leash to main collar.  Back to drawing board.,0

"I gather from the packaging of this grass that it's the same product that was once known as Cosmic Kitty Herbs, but it looks to me like the company has been taken over by another and for some reason the Cosmic name is somewhat downplayed on the packaging. That seems a little nuts to me since CKH had a pretty loyal and big following among cat owners. But that aside...

This is pretty good cat grass, if not a tad expensive (not outrageously so, however) and you only get four ounces in the package. The grass does grow very well though and I would estimate that the germination was probably 90-percent of better. I grew a 12x12-inch flat of it (using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-Gro-72986510-Organic-Choice-Potting-Mix-16-Quart-currently-ships-to-select-Northeastern-Midwestern-states/dp/B000BQLVNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle-Gro 72986510 Organic Choice Potting Mix, 16-Quart (currently ships to select Northeastern & Midwestern states)</a>&nbsp;and grew it under a small fluorescent lamp for the first week (until it was about four or five inches high). If you keep it in a fairly bright area and well watered, it will grow for a long time (or until the cats have munched it into submission).

The cats absolutely love the grass and began sneaking into while it was still under the grow light and knocking off the plastic lid I was using to hide from them (and good luck with that). So, grows very well, cats love it, is a little high priced but not too bad--but if you search online, you can find farmers selling red rye grass for cats in much bigger quantities (just read reviews so you get good-quality seed).",1
"If you have a dog with food allergies DO NOT FEED THIS! It looks so wonderful in the front but you need to really pay attention to the ingredients. We were forced to buy something different when our normal food was out but we needed dog food. Our Amstaff completely went downhill! Her skin broke out so badly and she itched so much she tore herself open and raw and her back paws were covered in blood from the itching. Her skin got so bad she was shuffling and unable to extend her legs comfortably. I honestly thought she'd been hit by a car or kicked by one of our horses but it was just her sores had made movement so painful. She was stuck in her bed for days and wouldn't eat or get up to drink. The point is, this is a very deceiving dog food and I would say is as comparable as the cheapest ""atta boy"" dog food. We've since gone back to our normal dog food and she's slowly recovering.",0
Good,1
"Well, I hate to write this review but unfortunately I feel I need to warn people.  I've been purchasing these treats for my dog for a while now and have been generally satisfied.  I have a grain-free dog with food allergies so I'm careful what to buy.  However, my last  purchase I bought 3 bags and when I went to open a second bag it was invested with small worm like bugs crawling through out the bag.  I had to discard it, in fact I burned the package as I didn't want to put it in my garbage.  This may have been a one time thing but I'm very wary to purchase them again.",0

Piece of junk,0
"Great clipper. Just push the button directly beneath the blade to unlock it, pull the blade forward first then slide upward to lift it out. When putting on a new blade, slide it over the metal tab on the clipper and push the blade in, making sure it clicks into place. The clipper comes with a size 10 blade. It's very short. I use it on my bichon's feet, bum, and sometimes his stomach. Since his fur is slightly sparse and he has a little cow-print on his skin, I like the 3/4"" HT for his head and body in the summer. It's short enough to keep him cool, but plush enough to cover his skin and give him a little poof. I like the size 7 (regular or skip tooth) for his body in the fall.

Side note on the blades: The 7 and 10 blades cut my dog's hair like butter. The 3/4"" HT works well but is slightly prone to snagging.

One thing to bear in mind, the blade can get hot. When I first started clipping my dog, I was a slow and careful newby -- thus, it was on longer causing the blade to get warmer with time.

With practice you get faster. I also tend to switch between blade sizes for my dog's body, feet, and head. These behaviors mitigate the issue.",1
a good urn for my dog she was 90 ills and its perfect,1
Exactly as promised and I would buy this product and from this seller again... Thanks!,1
I ordered five of these. More than half of them came so stuck together that they were impossible to use. This is the second time Ive ordered them. Its also the second time multiple roles have been absolutely useless. I won't order again,0
We purchased this for our lab puppy and have since taken it away. We were afraid she was going to seriously hurt herself. She started limping after hitting herself with the toy while using the rope to fling the toy in an effort to get treats out. We may cut the rope out and let her play with it again.,0
"This review is for this product: Armarkat Cave Shape Pet Cat Beds for Cats. Basically my cat never set foot in it except one night when he decided it apparently looked enough like a litter box that he peed in it. No matter how many times I washed it, the smell never came out. One day he peed in it again. Then I threw it out.

Two stars instead of one because it is soft and if I were a cat, I certainly would consider sleeping in it.",0
My cat would not eat this no matter what. I had bought another brand of L-Lysine and she adored it. It also took longer to be delivered then promised.,0
"11 month old and 14 year old dog detected nothing..  Battery connection terminals so tight they had to be tapped on with a small hammer, fingers alone could not get them on to bat terminal.  Then had to use screwdriver to try and pop them off to replace battery.  This of course broke the wire solder connection..  Put it aside to return later.  Forgot to do so only to find that the 30 day return policy had expired.  So now its in dead pile broken after 9 actual days of use.  Actually should be zero stars for this item.",0

Initially was disappointed because my dog refused to eat. But now I mix in the capsule content with a spoon full of pumpkin and she eats it right up. It seems to help her.,1
"Works great, filters last about one month. Take a little time to clean it but that should be expected and it is easy to do.",1
This was great except that the collar goes underneath and my dog had a skin tag and it rubbed against it. I bought it to use after the skin tag removal but it was not better than a regular collar. My friend with a Great Dane loves this collar.,1

"It was difficult to put together. My husband is a carpenter we did it right. It would not stay flush against door. I knew cats wouldn't use it so we secured it to a wall.
I have four adult cats. The shelves are too small for them. We left it hanging until after the holidays but not one cat would use it.
The window of return has sadly passed.
We plan on donating it to our local kitty shelter and advise them to secure it to a wall.
I hope the kitties will at least use it.

"This thing simply does what it's supposed to. But first, special thanks to James Dell for deciphering and posting the instructions for using it. Otherwise I would have been lost. (Sample from instruction booklet intro: ""Every pet owner may often curious about their pets gone done. With this camera, pet owners can observe a consistent line of kids"". --Well, yeah! I'm in!) Anyway, my dog keeps getting out of the fenced yard, which includes some woods, and I couldn't figure out how. So I dropped 25 bucks on this gizmo, and a few more on a micro sd card, charged it up, and stuck it on his collar this morning. When I came home this evening he was out, and I had 40 short videos of his ""consistent line of kids."" You know, what he'd been doing all day. And I found out (a) that he climbed a fallen tree to jump over the fence, and (b) that my next door neighbor is a really nice guy--even when no one's looking. B/c he was sweet to my dog when the dog got into his garbage. (I didn't know until I watched the video that the camera records audio too. And the neighbor didn't even cuss.) My wife and I got a good laugh seeing the world through the dog's eyes for a day. Recommended.

Update: Well, the 3rd day of use the dog came back w/o the camera. The clip by which it attached to the collar had broken off. So I have removed 1 star. Maybe it's better for cats & smaller dogs.",1

So if you have a larger puppy don't get these expecting 20 minutes of distraction, it was more like 5, but he did enjoy them and when we was super mouthy from teething they did seem to help!",1

"I have tried many products on my long haired cat who has a thick downy undercoat that mats and causes fur balls not to mention orange fur all over everything during shedding season.  I bought the wide coarse model--the cat loves it and it takes that undercoat out very gently--and most of the fur stays trapped in the rake until I remove it.  With the Furminator the fur flies all over and gets on everything.  Using the rake in combination with a brush has done the trick better than any product I have ever used before--and I think I have used them all.  Great purchase--whereas the Furminator, used one time, is on the way to Goodwill.",1

"I purchased the Pupteck Portable Dog Booster car seat carrier to use to transport my puppy safely in my car.  The product arrived and was neatly collapsed into a square.  I opened it up to install it in my car and found that it did not include any directions. I think that I installed it correctly by wrapping one strap around the head rest and one around the seat itself.  The carrier is assembled into a square by zipping it up.  The zippers do not secure the booster seat at all.  Once the dog leans against it the zippers come unzipped and it comes undone (it does not work as seen in the displayed picture).  I attached pictures of how this worked with my 13 pound dog.  I definitely would not recommend this as a car seat carrier.  It could be used as a pet carrier for a smaller dog or cat because it does have snaps that would secure the ""box"" position.  It has a cover and a screen that the animal could look out of.  It is well ventilated.  The one thing I did like about this compared to another booster seat I had used in the past is that it had the latch attached at the bottom of the carrier.  My dog did not use the bathroom while riding in it - but I imagine it would be quite a mess.  It doesn't seem like it would catch any liquids from soaking through.  Please note: I received a discount for my honest review of this portable dog booster car seat carrier.  I personally used this pet seat carrier and these are my honest opinions. I hope they were helpful.",0
"This harness has such great reviews and I don't know why. The hook for the leash is in the front and who walks IN FRONT of their dog? If you're buying a harness, it's probably because your dog pulls the leash pretty hard. If so, the dog definitely walks in front. It fits my dog really well, but the straps buckle & rub in the direction of where you're holding the leash. It's because when pulling, it has to wrap around the side of the dog unless you're directly beside the dog. Even if your dog is very well trained and does walk directly on your side, it still buckles and slides towards you some. My vet and dog walkers have all commented on how strange it was too.

Fits well, but it just doesn't make any sense to me. It just doesn't make any sense to me.",0

With the Dasuquin he has no trouble jumping or running and unless you were close enough to see all the grey on his muzzle, you would think he was only a teenager. It is a good day when a manufacturer's product actually lives up to its hype, and this one does.",1

"I feel ripped off.  This product had really high reviews when I bought them a few months ago but it's clear now those must have been fake.

Amazon needs to ban manufacturers that post fake reviews.",0

I have 7 dogs.  I thought this would keep their water fresher longer -- it doesn't.  The tubing gets gross looking and the plastic container doesn't hold very much water.  Not recommeded.,0

fun,1
Worked great on our black lab!  He's gotten ear infections before and it bothers the heck out of him.  He'll be pawing at his ear and his whole ear will get red.  Last time we took him to the vet for it he had to get some shots as well but in total it was over $300!  This time when he got an ear infection I order these drops and put them in his ear several times throughout the day as recommended on the bottle.  Within a few days his red ear irritation was gone!  Money well spent!,1

"I have a rather demure male white mini poodle.  He looks ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE in his gold bling collar!  It is well made and highly adjustable; and comfortable.  It just suits him (if you like some rather big statement as the bow is quite large) but that makes it cute as can be.  (A couple people said it reminds them of Liberace)................. HA HA!  Most of you are probably too young to know who I'm talking about but he was like a fabulous Elton John 'back in the day'.  Anyway, if you LOVE BLING and you want your pup to look CUTE CUTE CUTE - GET this collar.  I LOVE IT1",1
pets loves it.,1
"I wanted a car seat for a very small dog. This turned out to be enormous, even though it said it was for a small dog and showed a picture of a Yorkie. I wanted to return it but they offered me a 50% discount if I kept it. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I donated it to a shelter.",0
"These filters have a low cost but are dirty and clog quickly requiring replacement on a weekly basis.  These are far more costly in the long term than the original Drinkwell filters. The loose carbon is a mess to store, use, and clean up after... do not try these!",0
My plants really seem to do well with this and is about half the price vs. PetSmart.,1
My dog's favorite treat.  It has helped her breath and keeps her teeth clean.,1
I'm writing this review months after purchasing this and my cat still loves playing with it.  I actually recently flipped it upside down and she will jump around it and knock the balls around even more.,1
"I have several gerbils that I keep in pairs and trios (and 1 single fellow that won't get along with the others) in aquarium/terrarium style tanks or in plastic bins with mesh tops. (CritterTrail and Habitrail type environments are terrible homes for small rodent pets btw). I have this type Lixit bottle with both the straight and tilted nozzle. When looking for water bottles for my gerbil habitats my biggest frustration was that most smaller water bottles can only be attached to cage bars, and the ones that can be hung over the lip of a tank are so long they get buried too easily by bedding, so I end up usually having to hang water bottles in odd ways with wire mesh type contraptions and masking tape. I also have one terrarium where the lid doesn't fit properly over the hanging bottle lip. I love this Lixit bottle type because I can place it in the tank or bin and it stays securely sealed against the side of the wall. The bottle is easy to remove and refill, and I love the little indicator. It's perfect for a tank or bin with 1-3 gerbils (or other rodents). That said, it is plastic and thus chewable, so it is important to check the bottle daily to ensure it hasn't been chewed through and thus leaked out. But I have had these bottles for months and so far no major chewing damage. If I do start to see chewing damage I can use wire mesh to deter it, but I would like to see a similar concept botttle that is better guarded to prevent chewing, and also one that holds a larger volume by being longer horizontally (rather than vertically) so the spout can easily remain above the bedding.",1

Pads leak. I would put no stars if I could.,0
"We gave this toy to our dog and within 5 minutes of playing tug of war and some chewing, the rope toy was torn and ripped apart. This product is labeled as high quality, bite resistant, durable, and long lasting. None of what is advertised is true. I would not buy this toy again nor would I recommend it for any one with a medium or large dog.  It definitely was not long lasting.",0
"This harness is great for a lot of reasons, but problematic for others. It is easy to adjust, easy to put on. You just slip it over your dog's head and fasten the buckles. The buckles take a second to figure out. It seems very secure. Then you drive with it. The biggest problem is the mechanism that holds the back part in place- they made it so that you can use one of two loops based on your dog's chest size. However, the only thing that holds it in to the loop is a small snap. If you have a dog who moves around a lot (mine is pretty hyper, he doesn't sit still), the snap pulls apart immediately, then the thing twists around the body, so the part that should be on his back can rotate, and basically gives him a lot of space to wiggle around (and gives him a much longer reach). Also, it has a hook that allows you to walk your dog with it (front chest clip), but it doesn't fit closely enough. Again, a problem with the snap, as well as the fit. So it moves to the side when my dog pulls, then basically pins his front leg backwards when it gets stuck. This is a good idea in theory, but doesn't work well in practice. It's a shame, because the metal fittings seem very safe, but with the harness moving all over the place, the dog isn't secure. I need something else.",0
Cats love it!,1
I have used the beef rolls as a treat for training for over a year. These are used with some of the guide dog trainers. For some reason the formula is different. It is oily and smells different. The rolls have a greasy feeling. I buy them at Petco. I should have listened to the recent complaints from customers. After one day my Golden had diarea and upset stomach. He would not eat. I took 4 rolls back to Petco and told them they need to take it off the shelve. They really need to check it out and possibly recall told with 2016 expiration dates. I will not be using anymore. I think the new buyer has changed the formula. Sad,0
But that doesn't mean yours won't. Very nice construction for the price. Highly recommended.,1
"The only stuff that will help my dogs ear infections. They get and their ears smell like something crawled up in there and died. They itch their faces till they bleed. This makes it stop, it takes a few days to kick in. If it really bad keep doing till it goes away. The swelling starts to go away after day 3 or 4. I don't go without this for long when their ears start to get messed up.",1
"Our pup just about destroys any chew toy we give him. He also tends to be picky about his toys (win-win situation). However, he seems to love every benebone we've ever given him! He's an incredibly aggressive chewer (chewed right through a nylabone once) and these seem to last and keep him interested the longest out of any other chew toys we've ever given him. Cannot recommend these enough.",1
Cats go nuts over this toy - had to buy more so they wouldn't fight over them,1
I wish I read the reviews before buying this bed.  It is the worst piece of garbage.  It sheds constantly.  I try washing it so that the bed will stop shedding and instead it is wearing a hold in the bed.  I have only had it a few months and I feel like I wasted good money.  I think the only good reviews for this bed must have come from the manufacturer.  Don't waste your money on this one.,0
Horrible,0
"It turned out so beautiful! I ordered as a gift from my newborn to her father and he teared up when he saw it. Very, very happy.",1
My little guy looked so cute!,1
"""Doesn't leak""?  Don't believe it.  I have an aging Schipperke; they aren't very big dogs and don't leave a huge puddle.  But every single time he goes, it soaks all the way through to the floor.  I end up using a dozen paper towels to clean the mess left under the pad.  Cost-wise, it works more to my advantage to buy the cheaper store brand since the name brand results are less than impressive.",0
This is the second bowl I have received (a replacement for the first )  Neither of which came with the bracket to mount the bowl to the cage. Without the bracket they are useless.,0
Came and worked as advertised,1
Worked well and harness is sturdy,1
Have always loved this collar/leash.  It does it's job and is very reliable when you need to be quick to the draw in grabbing your dog.  At least it has been for me and my dog.,1
"This product worked so good on my 2 big labs. they'd always jump on our window seat in our front living room; and when they do, they end up pulling down the curtains. so besides gating the area; which wouldn't really work out; i thought they needed something like this. At petco; this product would've cost me over $100 for all 3 products that i bought (2 collars; a barrier thing, and a package of batteries); but for the deal that i got here on amazon on top of this product working; is a really good deal!!! highly recommend for those looking to find products that will keep their pets away from certain areas! =) my husband and i are truly satisfied.",1
I gave the bed to my 8 yr old lab for Christmas and she loves it. She has hardly gotten off it.,1
Smells like listerine.... my dogs won't drink it!,0
"This unit is dispenses fish food twice a day, I think...  But as I lost the manual that came with it, I can't say for sure.  It's a one touch proposition, but it's not intuitive.  There are two buttons, one of them is self explanatory.  It shows a picture of a fish eating.  Press that button and the dispenser rotates the food chamber and deposits food into the tank.  How much food is deposited depends on which setting you select on the face of the food chamber.  Min leaves a small opening for food to fall out of the chamber when it rotates.  The max setting will empty the container in just a few short cycles.  I use flakes and leave mine set to min for a 20 gal tank containing maybe 8 small fish.

The second button is labeled 12H and 24H.  What exactly do they do?  I haven't a clue.  The dispenser does not start when this setting is changed from one position to the other.

The unit has been working, as evidenced by bits of food scattered next to the opening at the tank top, but I've not seen or heard it operate (on it's own) since I put batteries into it and installed it on the tank several months ago.  Knowing the batteries might be getting old, I sought the instructions, so I could reset the unit when I replaced the batteries.  I couldn't find the manual so I looked on the unit for a label indicating manufacturer and model number.  Nothing!

I checked Amazon for automatic feeders and, judging by the picture, this is the unit.  So I Googled ""Cambridge Aquatics"".  Again NOTHING.  You'd think the company has some kind of web presence - a place to download owner's manuals perhaps?  Not this company.  After 15 minutes I gave up trying to locate instructions.

I'm not saying don't buy this unit.  But if you do. DON'T LOSE THE INSTRUCTIONS.

You might try other mainstream offerings instead though.",0
My dog loves these and the price is excellent.,1
It does not work!!!!!!!!,0
"Many requests for a purple hippo, this was what he was talking about.",1
Excellent!!,1
"Very pleased with the quality of the leash, even though our dog is still only a puppy, this will last a long time. The padded grip feels really comfortable and the shorter grip will be handy as he grows. Great product so far. Our dog is a Doberman pinscher.",1
"This is how you teach your children how to NOT care for fish properly: Buy them a 1g Mini Bow. Undergravel filtration sounds great, right? Maybe you're thinking that the filter intake is under the gravel, circulating the muck out of there and through a filter. This is not the case. This undergravel ""filter"" is simply a plastic grate that allow the poo to settle down to the bottom and not be disturbed so easily.

Anyway, the poo is only removed from the water when you manually pour it out. And good luck with that too, because as soon as you start moving things around in the tank, all that poop starts swirling around! It will be a little difficult for you to save some of the clean top water for your water change, now that there's poop swirling!

Besides all that, a 1g really isn't big enough for any fish, unless you intend on keep a very unhappy betta or something. Research proper fish care, and get something that has a proper filter on it. It makes your job a little easier.",0
"I bought this product after years of dealing with my dog barking at anything and everything. The first night after recieving the product I read the instructions and put it on my dog ""Teska"". She is very well trained and is used to having collars and leashes taken on and off had no problems puting it on. The first real test was my girlfriend coming home. My dog knows that barking is not ok and does so anyway. She head my girlfriend get home and barked once and got an imidiate beep and shock. This stunned her and made her stop she looked at me and then barked again and recieved another shock. She stopped barking for a good while. Again, later that week friends came over and she barked but she was so excited that she kept barking. I supose that with each bark the shock gets worse. It shocked her so bad she started screaming. She got outside and screamed and ran in circles getting shocked and screaming. I ran to her picked her up and took the collar off. She was ok just a little frightened. I just wanted to say that that this product really does work and I still use it, just be careful with a dog that's new with it. Thanks to this product we all now get peaceful nights sleep and for that I am eternally greatful.",1
"Very disappointing! Took my experienced daughter 3 hours to do a basic puppy cut on my 12 pound poodle mix, and it was still choppy. She said they were the worst clippers she'd ever used.

"The bells where not loud, all they did is thunk hard on my door.  I was currently using a holiday bell which sounded great except my inlaws needed more bells so that they could hear it and that is why I ordered this product. I ended up purchasing more of the bells that are used during the holiday season which are a thinner metal so they sound like bells and I just added them to what I used before. The inlaws can hear it now when the dogs use it for going out.",0
"Unbelievable!!  Right after I first purchased my Betta, he began to look splotchy. I tried several treatments, even one for ich but I was pretty sure it wasn't ich. I then ran across Betta Revive and when I tried it he cleared up within 2 or 3 days and looked great, but very slowly began to ""resplotch"". Frustrated, I didn't try any other treatments  because they all failed and he began to look worse than ever. I thought I had done everything according to the instructions of each medication and removed the ""carbon filters"", but I had a bag of purigen that I left inside since it wasn't carbon , so I did a complete water change and removed the purigen. He was looking really bad and had no energy, so I decided to try the revive again as a last resort and sure enough, he has cleared up completely and is re-energized and is as beautiful as he was when I first purchased him. Its been a couple of weeks and still doing great.  What is in this stuff?? I have no idea, but I am keeping a supply on hand and will use it at the first sign of a flare-up. If you have a sick fish, this is definitely worth a try. I'm sure it won't cure every problem but has been amazing for me.",1
"I have 6 cats and after reviewing the electric self cleaning litter boxes, I did not think they would be a good match. I was skeptical of this box but they love it and I love the easy litter cleaning. Just roll the box over then back to original position. All of the litter clumps will be deposited in the easy remove and empty removable drawer. No more digging out the waste with a scoop. I ordered two more of these and threw out my old boxes.",1

"Okay, I am a crazy dog mom. I want the best for these two guys and so I read the reviews and thought this was going to give them good, healthy water. Well, first, they were scared to death of it, they got over that and started to use it. The worst and second point is, it gets junked up with slime, dirt and God knows what!!! I clean it every couple of days and take it totally apart to do this and still it's gross!!! I am so unhappy I spent this money on such a horrible item!!!!! Skip it.",0
"My dogs love these. My one pibble favors this favor, the other LOVES the peach. We got these from a local pet store. I even snack on these!",1
Got my blue nose pit a XL it fits pretty snug on him. I measured him before and went off the size chart. Will buy a bigger size for him. He is 120lbs of solid meat and has a big chest so I should have figured he would need a bigger size than it says. It is good material and holds up against rolling in the pokey grass.,1
"Great product, great vendor.  Shipped on time with no issues.  Thank you.",1
Stopped my flie infestation. This is a must with multiple animals during the summer. I was getting eaten alive before buying this. But also take the largest cooking pan you have. Fill the pan with water. Add dawn soap. Mix it around. Place it in a carpeted dark area. Place a lamp over it. Turn out all the lights when you go to work. This combo with the collar and you will be golden. Thank me later,1
"I wanted something narrow and tall to put in front of my sliding glass doors for the cats to hang out on.  I have another cat tree that is awesome so I figured it would be similar.  Unfortunately, it's not.  it's a big, cardboard junkpile and I will never buy from Majestic Pet again.

Pros:
-Cats will ultimately have fun in a pile of broken glass if you let them so the bar is set relatively low

Cons:
-Instructions are HORRIBLE.  Luckily, assembly is somewhat intuitive so it went together rather quickly
-Carpet is very low quality.  It matted and pilled after just a month; whereas my other cat tree has been in the house for a year and zero issues like this
-Cat house is the size of a shoe box and unusable
-Pillars are cardboard.  Screws pull out of cardboard. 3 times thus far, I've found the second level collapsed with a sharp screw hanging out. Again, these problems are not had with other manufacturers because they don't use cardboard

For the price, I'd be much more inclined to recommend something from Go Pet.  I have http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091OLFQE/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and like I said, a year in and it looks brand new.",0
Great way to add bio filtration to your aquarium.,1

"I love it, but my cat hasn't figured it out yet. For reference, Cricket is a 15 pound Maine Coon mix. She likes sitting or laying on the window bed when I put her up there, but she doesn't like getting into it herself because it's a little springy. I had grand plans of creating tons of window seats at different heights for her to jump up to, but she only gets on the bed herself if I put treats up there. The suction cups are impressive. I did clean the window and the cups with Windex wipes before sticking the cups to the window. I haven't had any issues with suction. The brown material covering the bed is kind of slick, but I think if you put a blanket or pillow on it, it would really help. I do put treats on it to try to entice her to lay on the bed. I don't know why I'm so concerned that she enjoy laying on the bed, when she's happy watching squirrels from the floor. I included a picture of her on the seat (I put her there) so you could see her size compared to the seat.",1

"Amazon should not allow sellers to list on their site without showing the ingredient.  They could be harmful for our pet's health.  For instance Sorbitol may increase the diarrhea.  As for coloring and flavoring?  Cats like meat, so why not make it fish flavored.  Ours loves tuna and especially white fish.  It is us humans that like fruit. Cats are carnivores  (meat eaters unless starved). There are always exceptions to this rule, but cats need the protein in meat  for good muscle health.  Dogs do not.",0

Without it on she pants so much, her tongue gets swollen and she moves like a slug.  Definitely keeps her cool!!  My only complaint is that it is too big.  I have a few other Ruff Wear coats in medium and they fit my dog perfectly.  This one is too big around her chest.",1

"This product works well in combination with cleaning or treating all areas your dog makes contact with on a daily basis. Great results on dogs that suffer from minor and severe skin rashes from allergic reactions, yeast infections, or from flea bites. Even though it's still pricey here and you have to bathe your dog 3-days in a row, the vet charges $27.00 dollars for an 18oz bottle of a similar product. While these are only 8oz bottles, there is just enough shampoo to bathe a small or large dog the recommended three times. For an extremely large dog you may need more than one botte. I only purchased this product through Amazon because it's somewhat less expensive than buying it from my vet. However, if I could find the same product it at a lower price somewhere else I'd buy it.",1
"This is a fantastic crate. I measured it so it fit right under the desk in the kitchen, and exchanging the pad for a towel, I feed our puppy there and then wheel him around the house wherever he needs to be contained.

"This is absolutely NOT what you want for your training needs.  At the beginning, it works ""okay"", with minimal impact (similar to dragging your feet on carpet and getting a shock).  However, the collar eats up batteries quickly (went through 3 in a week).  You have no idea if its dead other than when the light is completely off that you need to put in a new battery.  AND, when the light is still on, you cannot guarantee a charge, unless you've JUST put the battery in.  Often times we would be activating the remote and he would sit there looking at us, when we realized it wasn't giving a shock.  We were hoping to train our pup with this but no luck. And, do not buy the batteries that are listed with the product above, they do not fit.  You have to buy completely different batteries.  Nothing like trying to fit a round peg in a square hole.",0

"Incredibly expensive and apparently in very short supply as the only option available to me at the time of purchase was the two-bottle pack. Bought this as a Hail Mary for my beloved Australian Shepherd suffering from hemangiosarcoma as this stuff supposedly boosts the immune system, can shrink malignant tumors, and can significantly prolong (by months) the life of a dog suffering from cancer. These conclusions were based on a single, small study done by the Univ. of Pennsylvania Vet School. Unfortunately, due to the particulars of my dog's cancer fight, she was only able to take this stuff for 3.5 days, it did not make one bit of difference in terms of prolonging her life or in fighting the cancer. Given the cost of this item, I had high hopes I'd found a silver bullet against the cancer, but it was not to be.  At the end of the day, this is one of those Chinese mystery medicines that have indeterminate origins, a clever but unverifiable origin story, and a hefty price tag. Cannot recommend this stuff unless you're sure you've got at least 2-3 weeks to administer this to see if it will actually work.",0

The ktty urine goes right through the pellets and onto a pee pee pad (completely hidden) and the soild matter is just scooped, pellets shaken off with specail kitty scoop and tossed. I clean soild waste daily and only change the pee pee pad every week 1/2... NO URINE SMELLS AT ALL!

USE/Cost: I buy my breeze pellets and pads through Amazon...much cheaper than local and come right to my door. The pellets I have not ever removed but just add more about every two weeks and the pads I change every week 1/2.... over all not bad since I was buying very expensive litter and changing almost weekly.

I am hoping to convert the 3rd box over as well but we have a very PICKY pusian who hates ANY other cat to share her kitty box...",1

"I was REALLY excited about this getting this kit for my 8 month old kitten, but was sorely disappointed at the quality of the toys. The string of the dangling mouse on the rod snapped off the very first night (during light play). The string of the other mouse with the bell also snapped after a week. Really wish I didn't spend almost $17 on this.",0
"Only lasted 2 days before my Beagle broke into it and destroyed it it.  Which is one more day than I though it would last , so it's got that going for it, which is nice.  Now I have to put it on a shelf and let it rain food down on my dog, which is okay I guess because it's like a magical food fountain twice a day for him. He likes that.

Very hard to program.  Got locked out by it and had to start over from scratch by taking the batteries out.

Worked okay otherwise.",0
The second machine (first one broke within a month of receivership) developed the same acute problems with the scooper as previously noted.  Where are the days when the initial product lasted well over 5 years.....,0

"In the description it indicates the launcher is 21"" long. Instead they shipped me one that is 13.5 inches long. I can get that at any pet store. It was the 21"" unit that made me order this. Amazon should fix this product description. Do not order if you want the 21"" model.",0

"This is a tough toy my dog is on his 6th Mr. Bill what can I say I grew up watching Saturday Night Live when it was actually funny.  Just using this as comparison he does play with Mr. Bill more often but he also likes this guy and presents it to me and after playing fetch works it over for 10-20 minutes at a time and he still has a head, arms, feet and isn't  tore to bits like a lot of his other stuffed toys.  Plus the toy is pretty cool looking.",1

I missed the return limit by one day.  I can salvage the bag by sewing it shut again. But if you don't have a sewing machine, the time, or the temperament. . .pass on this sock.",0
"My cat has absolutely no interest in this. It's just a bunch of cardboard. Even with the cat nip my cat keeps digging at the couch instead. One star, hardly deserves that.",0
Very well made. Replaces another brand which my puppy was able to tear and destroy. Our 30 lb Wheaton Terrier very comfortable in this size. Update: fast forward 4 months. The bed is still great looking and my 8 month old puppy has not made any attempt to chew or destroy it. She seems very comfortable and spends time in it when she has had enough of laying on our tile floor.,1
Shipping was great but this product was junk.  I purchased this as a back up heater in case my heater I was using failed.  1 year after I bought this my old heater failed.  I put this heater in and was thankful I had this on hand.  A day later I realized this didn't work.  It was stored safely and not used until I needed it.  Sadly the time to do a refund has passed.  It is my own fault for not testing this at the time I purchased it.  From this point on I will stay away from this brand.,0
"The glue, although listed in the instructions as non-toxic and safe, caused my dogs nails , cuticles, and paws to react horribly and swell.  Soaking the dogs feet every day has helped loosen up the glue. Ive used this product on my cats before and never had any problems.  My suggestion:  If you're going to use the product, DO ONE NAIL FIRST and then wait a day to see how the animals skin reacts.",0

"I was so excited to get this cage, then when I was putting it together I found there was no instructions at all. The stand bars & base/bottom of cage was all scratched up, there was a bent baron the cage & a crack in the base. Also the tabs will not stay in place, you need to use pliers to try and bend them, which most of the tabs won't bend. The roof kept popping out on one side, I put in the perches and the side popped out. I would have to buy wire and wire the whole cage together to get it to hold securely. Also the cage and bars are so flimsy, very poor quality. It also looked like it it was not a new cage with all the damage. DO NOT BUY this defective cage!!",0
Exactly what I was looking for,1
"I did my due diligence before ordering this cage, so I knew it didn't have a pull-out tray.  I didn't know it would take the strength of Hercules to snap the plastic clips to the wires to assemble it. I can see why some people give up on the plastic clips and use nylon zip-ties to hold the wire sides together.
I also didn't know that the wire grate (also not a pull-out), is so close to the bottom of the cage that using litter, instead of paper, isn't a good option. There's not enough room to add enough litter to make it useful.
The whole design of the base is another issue.  There are raised areas on both ends of the bottom of the base, where the seed/water cups fit, making it very inconvenient to fit paper towels/newspapers in the base. Rounded corners in the base and the grill also mean that if you plan to use papers you'll have to trim them to fit.  I ended up making a paper template to cut a section of heavy-duty plastic shelf liner to fit the bottom of the cage.  I can take it out and wipe it off and re-use it.
The cage does do a good job of containing the feathers and seed hulls.
If Hagen is reading this, a couple of simple changes to the base would make these cages much more user friendly.  The base height should be increased by an inch, the base corners should be squared, and a pull-out grill and an easy clean pull-out drawer should be added.  Their claim that a drawer would only make a mess is simply not true.
Bottom line for me, I'm not happy, and I can't recommend this line of cages.",0
"Love the product.
Love the service .
Love the price.
Best cat litter ever. Absorbs the smell really well. :)",1
this product keeps coming off. It could be due to the shape of my SUV's top but this product doesn't suit at least my vehicle. It was easy to put together but it kept coming off very easily.,0
way to small on my dog i ordered a large and it wouldn't even button up on him so its useless to me.,0
"There are some areas that I prefer to be a little smoother, could possibly cause a callus or a wound from friction..  The size I ordered was too small (I would recommend you order a size up)  This is for a dog with a narrow muzzle.  I have a Rottweiler (the muzzle is long and narrow).  The strap and closure should be a little more heavy duty.",0
"If you have cats that are messy eaters, consider getting a more traditional food bowl.

Other than that, these bowls are easy to clean and don't take up a lot of room. They do come with an annoying plastic sticker in the middle of them. Be prepared for that.",1
Very big.  Cat must have very big head to work. Otherwise falls off immediately.,0
"A bit big. I have a jack Russell terrier and the small with big on him, felt like it a medium. Other than that, good collar.",1
"This could have been so much better. It does kind of work, but it's cheaply made and there are problems with it that make it not worth the money. I have 2 cats, so since it's receptacle is small, it must be given attention every 3 or 4 days--not much different than a litter box you have to scoop. And since the cleaner only picks up ""bigger"" items, stuff gets left in the box and must be scooped by hand. And worse than that, urine clumps often get broken into small peices that stay in the box and sometimes they even stick to the bottom--this is exacerbated by the fact that the automatic scooper doesn't really scrape all the way to the bottom. All of this together means, the devices needs lots of attention and isn't that much of a step forward from a ""manual"" litter box.",0
Just got the leash but from what I have been able to tell it is well made,1
I have Greyhounds and these are too small. They do like them but a few chews and the are gone,1
Bettas should be housed in at least a 3 to 5 gal tank with a filter and silk or live plants for a better environment. The fish will live longer and be happier.,0

"My boyfriend and I were in a car wreck earlier this week when a 90 year old failed to see our car and pulled out in front of us when we were going 55mph. My boyfriend was driving, I was sitting in the front passenger seat, and my 11 year old 120 pound golden retriever was sitting in the back seat. My dog would have shot out of the windshield if it wasn't for this harness. I have a broken neck, but I'm not paralyzed, and my dog is okay. I am so grateful for this harness. I haven't even had it for month. He's got a little bruising and a limp, but he is alive and okay. I cannot thank Bergan enough for keeping my dog safe. Thank you!",1
These are the only treats my chihuahua will eat. They are the perfect size and she is only 7 lbs.,1
Make sure you are aware that this is the worlds smallest dog toy. Like in Zoolander when they have the school for kids who can't read good and he thinks it's a school for ants.  That's how tiny this thing is.,0

"This only gets a second star because after all my cursing to put this thing together, my cats are having a great time on it.  For once in my life, I would like to receive a Chinese manufactured product that actually has quality control and workmanship.  I realize that all American jobs have been shipped overseas to take advantage of the Chinese slave laws so greedy people can get richer and everyone else can starve, but if we're going to be stuck getting products from the Chinese, might it not be worth it if someone could show them how to drill a hole completely?  Is that really too much to ask?  There is nothing like using a hammer and a bolt to drive through that last bit of thin faux wood so you can actually use the bolt in the manner it was intended.  Oh, and could they be taught to cut a hole in the fabric so that after the faux wood is cleared, there is no other impediment?  And must all the metal pieces arrive rusted?  At least the cubby holes are the faux wood and not just fabric - it makes the product a bit sturdier.  I have to vacuum now - there are bits of faux wood and cheap fabric all over my floor.
Update 3/12/16:  The cats are on this a lot and seem to enjoy it.  For some reason, the posts don't stay tight and when the cats are jumping all over it, it rocks like a ship on a stormy sea.  I am constantly re-tightening the posts and shelves.  I honestly don't know how long this will last.",0
"Size Chart is wrong,  Sweater is much smaller than chart sizes, very disappointed as I measured my dog carefully according to instructions.",0

"Great size for multi-cat family.  Litter does not stick as much.  One improvement would be a top cover with a filter!  I have 4 furry guys and clean the pan 2-3 times a day.  (They even have their own bathroom where box is kept)  I would give it ""6"" stars if it had a cover!",1
"My 10 pound shih tzu was driving me up the wall with his constant barking. He woke me and my roommates up every morning, terrorized guests, etc. I didn't want to use a shock collar on him, especially because he's so little. He acts like an angel now. He still barks every once in a while, but when the collar sprays it scares him so much that he stops after the first bark. Would highly recommend! He is a completely different dog now.",1
very short for my application. may help someone else with smaller aquarium but the effects and transitions are as advertised.,0
"Poor fit.  The gauge shown is not accurate.  It should have had plenty of room for my medium dog, but we couldn't even fasten it.",0
I have owned one of these before and I love it. My dogs don't mind it at all. Great product!,1
Cave could be a little roomier and the plastic tube popped through the material with very little use.,0
Son loved it,1
"This was pretty terrible. I realize that it depends on the dog, but I can only speak for my own experience (that's what these are for right?). My dog tore this apart VERY quickly. He's a chewer, and a puppy so he tears through fluffy squeaky toys, but has traditionally loved rope/rubbery toys and not eaten them. This seemed to be an exception. A few minutes after I gave this to him he had managed to swallow the fringe part of the toy. So I cut off the part he didn't chew. Then he chewed the rope right off of the toy and almost swallowed that before I caught him. I really wanted to get some use out of this toy so I took the rope part off and let him play with the blue part. Nope! He chewed it apart and swallowed some of it before I got to him.

Again, maybe your dog will be better with it than mine was. But my little guy is a chewer and this was not a good toy for him. Luckily it went ""right through"" him and I caught the remnants a few days later.",0
My dog loves her new toy.,1
tooo narrow.  doesn't leave any wiggle room and my dog gets it to slide a bit and no coverage on what matters.,0
"It is really helping with getting him used to having his teeth cleaned.  To be fair, he does try to eat most of it and I have to work quite quickly to get it onto his teeth but he's learning and the fact that he thinks it's so tasty is very helpful.",1
"**BEWARE** we started feeding this to our dog and he was constantly thirsty. He would even wake up in the middle of the night a few times to gulp down tons of water. I routinely exam his ears and noticed that the inside of his ears were really dry and began peeling about 1-2 weeks after being on this food. His paws also were really dry and peeling. This has never happened to him before and I've had him for 5 years. I stopped this food and switched him to lucky dog cuisine homemade food and he almost immediately stopped waking in the night for water. His ears and paws stopped peeling as well.

This food dehydrates your dog. Do not buy and do more research. I can only imagine how dry his internal organs were if his ears and paws were so bad.

Be careful dog lovers!!",0
"My vet recommended that I begin using this product for my 15 year old cat.  She used to have a lot of clicking and popping in her joints prior to using this product. Since she has been on the Cosequin, I no longer hear the joint noise that I had been hearing previously.

It's a much better deal buying this product online (even with shipping).  My vet charged over $30.00 for the exact same quantity.",1
Battery dies very very quickly,0
"My dog loves these cookies, even he is a lab, i prefer to give him small treats",1
"After reading the ingredients and the fact that it's 82% water I considered my options. They say to feed about 1 can (13.2) ozs. for every 12 lbs. of dogs weight. my 75 lb. Golden Retriever so just over 6 cans about .75 cents/can even at Amazons great price and no shipping it's $4.50/day. I can buy flats of 5 dozen extra large eggs for $2.25/dozen or 19 cents/egg, scramble 6 eggs in a little oil and you've spent $1.20. They say on the label that 1 cup dry kibble is the equivalent to 1.5 cans of this product so I stir 2 cups of hi protein kibble about 70 cents for two cups in to the lightly cooked eggs add table scraps as a garnish. So feed their recommended amount $4.20 or give your dog highly palatable food with necessary vitamins and minerals contained in the kibble for less than $2. As for time it only takes 2 min to soft scramble eggs. My dog trots beside me for my daily 5 mile bike ride. Since I began the new feeding regimen the dog lost excess weight has very good muscle tone and her coat has noticeably improved from dryish to shining probably from the cooking oil and eggs. If your pet has reactions to the wheat or corn in the kibble you might want to eliminate that kibble for the obscenely expensive rice based products or just rely on the table scraps and perhaps some vitamin supplement.

May you and yours be well,",0
didn't last dog chewed it up first time wearing it,0
I had chewbacca as a pet before I purchased this brush. Now he looks like he belongs in some version of a cat vogue. Completely helped with the shedding and his coat seems to be a lot softer and shinier. I definitely recommend this brush.,1
Great crate for a reasonable price. Love the two doors because my home is small so I could put my crate wherever I needed and it was still accessible. I do not know what more I could expect from a crate.,1
"I have 6 cats total, 5 inside and 1 outside. We have been feeding Friskies Seafood Sensations for about 3 months and every single one of our cats have been puking up the food, daily. This ranges from whole undigested food to bright orange projectile vomit. We used to feed this a year or so ago and everything was fine. For all of my cats to be experiencing the same thing, something has got to be up. I'm tired of cleaning this up and of my cats feeling like crap. I'm not sure what's in this food that is making them this way, but it's got to be pretty bad. I'm afraid to even donate the remainder of the food to a shelter because of it. The racoon are going to eat well I guess.",0
"i like this thing a lot. it is a brilliant light fixture with separate switches for the heat and fluorescent lights. also has a fan built in to keep the fixture a little cooler.

unfortunately, it has been very hard for me to find lights for this. but i heard pet smart carries them. there isn't one near my house, and they are next to impossible to find in other pet stores or even on amazon, which is supposed to have everything =)

"We have three cats and four litter boxes. Cat #1 has NEVER been happy about the addition of cats #2 and #3. Ever since their arrival, MONTHS ago, #1 has been consistently peeing and pooing right beside the box. We tried moving the box, and she simply scooted over to do her stuff. We put this in all the boxes over a week ago. A few minutes after using it, #1 did pee beside the box out of habit, but she hasn't done it again all week! This is incredible. We've gone from cleaning smelly puddles and piles every single day to not at all. Thanks to the Cat Attract, we are a happy family again.",1

"Totally disappointed, I should have used the money for a professional carpet cleaner...which I have to do now. I actually think my rug stinks more now.

Unfortunately I shampooed it up and now the entire carpet is stinking, from all pets that ever lived here.",0
"WARNING: I would be very careful about feeding this food to any dog that is an ""inhaler"" as opposed to a ""chewer"". I believe this food actually contributed directly to my dogs death. I wanted a food that would I could switch my dog from Hills Science Diet I/D, and this one seemed to be ideal for my 14 year old Affenpinscher. Unfortunately, the kibble pieces are so small that it is very easy for a dog that ""inhales"" their food, to ingest the pieces into their wind pipe. This is exactly what happened to my dog the first time that I fed it to him. I fed him a small  amount of this kibble mixed with Science Diet I/D, which he had been on for a few months and which he had no problems. Upon the first feeding, my dog began to attempt to cough up a piece of food that been ingested into his windpipe. He was unable to eject the piece of food. Over the next day he continued to attempt to eject the inhaled food from his respiratory system and began to hack and have a very difficult time breathing. I took him to the vet and they indicated that they could not see the piece of food that had lodged in his windpipe with an x-ray but for $1500 to $2000 I could take my dog to the local animal hospital where they had the proper tool to access the respiratory system and remove the piece of food that had lodged there. Since I did not have the money to spend on this procedure, the vet suggested that she try to utilize a balloon type device to pull the obstruction out of the breathing path. As I was desperate to get my dog breathing again I agreed that this may be a feasible solution to the problem. Unfortunately, as soon as the anesthesia was administered, my dog's heart stopped, and he died. I am not saying that this will happen to any other dog but because my dog was an inhaler of his food, I believe that the very small size of this product contributed directly to his death, one day after his fourteenth birthday. I am obviously broken hearted about losing my pet and I would like to warn those that are considering using this product for their  dog that may be an ""inhaler"" as it is so small that it can be easily ingested into the respiratory system and cause problems with the animal being able to breathe.",0

I have an 8 month old 100 pound Alaskan Malamute puppy and this is the only crate large and stout enough to properly accommodate him while I am away. This cage appears to be nearly identical to the Empire model which costs twice as much. So far I am loving my purchase.,1

"I have previously purchased Solvit car seat protectors and they work well [& are easily washable]. A key factor is a little dowel that you push down between the cushions to keep the cover in place.

He's five years old an has always had skin allergies and the only thing that actually works is steroids and Apoquel, both of which are basically poison.  I'll keep giving him this oil until I've used it all because I find it highly unlikely that it can do little to no harm.  I won't buy it again though.",0

"The savory chicken smells like chicken liver, but doesn't list chicken liver on the label. If you look at the picture, there appears to be whole chicken chunks -- NOT!

Love being able to keep my cat active when away from home and having people play with him while I am asleep. Absolutely no problems with app. Only problem is when I tried to calibrate laser it would pop off screen and I had to guess where it was and thus made it worse. My suggestion is to leave laser alone if works good enough.,1
The whole design is upside down. What a waste of money,0
The one star is for the price. I just bought these at our local Meijer store for $12.49 plus tax. Amazon wants to charge me $26.47 for the exact same product with my prime account. I thought to check Amazon because I thought I might get them cheaper thinking what I paid locally was kinda high. Not sure if all the people that gave them a positive review paid what Amazon is charging now or if they are aware they can get them LOTS cheaper elsewhere. Great product though. Our dog is a very discerning eater but loves these treats.,0
This product is exactly what my dogs needed.  It is also at a great price for the number of applications,1

looks like it had absolutely no business in the aquarium product whatsoever!!!  fish would eat it by accident (dead soon later) and will stuck in side the filter clog in the way that sand would never do ( it destroyed my filter pump) as you can hear the sound of it cracking away inside the pump cause it float around endlessly! (like watching a lava lamp effects)  which and neither of any other aquarium gems would ever do such. It Should made a necklace instead of swimming with the fish.,0
"Really disappointed.  I have a 60lb Red nosed Pitbull/Labrador mix.  I got him the L/XL sized leash.  He loves to pull as hard as he can.  I got him when he was already almost two, and he's my first dog.  So I was hoping this leash would solve my problems.  But, it didn't.  Yes, it did help a tiny bit.  He is no longer able to pull my arm from its socket when he suddenly takes off after a cat.  But he still PULLS constantly.  He just drops his head and pulls, pulls, pulls.....  I'd say this leash relieved about 10% of the pulling affect.  But that's all.  And, now he doesn't like the leash.  He used to go flipping crazy whenever I grabbed the leash.  Jumping all over me so much I couldn't get him to stay still.  Now he stops moving completely and slowly turns his head away from me.  And this was a dog that two minutes earlier was pestering me to take him for a walk.  So, we're back to using the collar leash and I'm out $16 on this leash.",0
Item is perfect for my guinea pig.,1
Two of my dogs seem to get ear infections all of the time and it gets quite expensive always going to the vet for the ear drops. If I start giving them this product at the very first signs of the infection I notice that it helps it go away or at least alleviate symptoms with a day.,1
Super cute with squeakers in body and each foot-- it's her absolute favorite.  Unfortunately lamp chop is not indestructible but what plush/fleece toy is?,1
"We found out about this toy at the dog beach and had to buy 2 (one for back up). This is a favorite toy for several dogs at the dog beach. If your dog loves water like mine,  it's easy to carry in the mouth while swimming back to shore.",1
My puppy destroys everything and she loved it so much that it didn't last quite as long as we had hoped. They lived up to their guarantee with their easy return process.,1
Had for a month and a half then shattered in my sons fish tank today out of no where. Really disappointed because it was doing an awesome job hold temp in his 15 gallon tank.,0
This is quite pretty.,1
Our dog loves this bed. Since he doesn't chew on his stuff it was definitely worth the money.,1
Fits well and is better to use than the choker chain.,1
"This sweater was not true to size, waste of money!!! Way to small",0
"I have only used it for four months, for one kitty cat and it is broken! When I roll the tray, the clean litter will fall right into the lower tray from the lower right hand side. Very disappointed for the money that I spent for this product and it only last for a few months.",0
"No better than the $1.49 baby wipes from the local store, and actually worse. These are the thickness of a cheap baby wipe. They are less effective than baby wipes in terms of cleaning and odor. They are kind of dry. They are as effective as a very, very damp paper towel, or just a paper towel. Rub your dog with a paper towel and you will get the same results. I had just received them, and went to use them, and abandoned the product mid process and went for the pack of much more moist baby wipes.  I was swayed by the other positive reviews on this, and not only wasted the money, but thought I was prepared for this long, frigid cold weather during which I cannot bathe my dog and cannot get to a pet store. I was left unprepared because I bought these do-nothing wipes.  I am back to the baby wipes. Save your money and go buy $1.49 baby wipes at the local store.",0
Our husky loves this chicken.  Great find!,1
"Great toy, but I wouldn't suggest this for a dog with a larger snout because he can't get his nose or teeth in the small opening. I tried tearing it open to make it a little larger, but I just became another plush toy. I have a Great Dane and he's in love with a squirrel-in-a-tree plush toy that's the same concept but the openings are larger.",1
"It is amazingly easy to put together. The bottom slides right out so it is easy to clean. Once set up it is sturdy as well. I don't use the partition, but it hooks in very easily. Having two doors is convenient, I leave them both open when I'm home so my dog doesn't feel as closed in. If I knew someone who needed a pet kennel I would recommend this brand. It also slides along the floor easily. It has a handle, but I don't use it for transport. It's not super heavy though, so I could lift it with my dog inside if I needed to.",1
Just as described,1
I purchased this stroller for my mother so she can walk with her cat around the neighborhood. What attracted us to this stroller is because it gives a good view with the mesh for the pet to look around while inside.,1
"I bought these for our dogs because the package says they are natural and healthful. The package does NOT mention that they can kill dogs by causing intestinal blockage, vomiting, and horrible diarrhea. Maybe if you supervise your dog while it eats a Nubz and make sure that your dog chews it THOROUGHLY, you might not have a problem. I bought these treats two days ago and ALL FOUR OF OUR DOGS ARE VOMITING AND/OR HAVE TERRIBLE DIARRHEA! If you buy this product, you should monitor your dogs closely. We have taken one of our dogs to the 24-hour Emergency Clinic and the others are on a bland diet to help their symptoms.",0
It's a nice urn but the top is all scratched up and chipped. The lid is also damaged. My in laws are happy with it but I am not. I am not sure if we will be ordering from them again.,0
Awesome i love it.great quality,1
"I buy a lot of toys for my dogs...so guilt made me purchase this item...so good they were inexpensive, because my cat won't play with it....I don't believe there is anything wrong with the item he just doesn't play much....",0
"I got a size 1. Its the right size for my dog, but somehow she can still bark through it. Doesnt work for us. She isn't super small, but maybe the part that goes on the snout should be a bit smaller for these dogs. She is a Bichon frise/shih tzu",0
"Love it! I have a large cat who needed more room, and now he's got it.  My mom even had me order her one for her cat who was ""thinking outside the box"", but no longer has that issue. Totally recommend, especially for the price.  Arrived promptly too, always a bonus.",1
Great variety of chew things.  It is fun to watch my dog chew on the giant Cow ear.  Always a special treat.  I wish there was a picture guide to show what some of these things are so I can order more of them - the grey spikey sticks especially.,1
"I can't say enough good things about the Gentle Leader. Why did I wait so long to get one? Our Golden has always been a very happy loving dog, who's zest for life is apparent. She likes to pull on walks and jump on new people she meets. We have tried training with traditional leashes, and even the prong collar, with limited results. The Gentle Leader is just what we needed all these years. She's an angel with perfect doggy-manners in this head collar!",1
Works well to keep urine odors at bay.,1
"My dog got loose and the new Logical collar was left completely unbuckled on the ground. Hows that for logic?! Arent collars supposed to stay on? It was apparent she hadnt pulled out of the collar as it was completely lay flat length-wise on the ground. My dad looked at the collar and said that he buckle or part of the buckle apparatus was manufactured incorrectly. So now as logic wild
have in my precious comfort dog is dead.",0
"I wanted to like these. In theory, there is no reason that this shouldn't be a great product. However, even small amounts of urine soak through the pad to the floor (that's with attaching a disposable pad to the top and this pad just collecting any drips). I haven't even put mine in the washer or dryer I've only rinsed them and line dried, still they do not work.",0
I got this to help my little old lady feel better because she's getting arthritis. It was a good idea in theory except that none of the 4 cats will eat these. A couple of them will lick the treat to be polite but will wander off as soon as I look away. One of them thinks eating the bag is interesting but the treats are a no-go.,0
My dog loves this!,1
"Caused an emergency room visit to the vet. Pierced my dogs neck with both prongs and frankly it smelt like death. Got refunded the amount for the device and a $10 promotional credit, but did not nearly cover the $400 vet bill. Do not buy this or a similar product.",0
It took my lab about 2 hours to destroy this toy.  Its not nearly as tough as some of the Kongs.,0
"worthless piece of s***t  it's too light and Mr. Bean culd never sharpen bis nails because it moved... save your money, it's a simple piece of corrugated carton, not worth the 9 box",0
"My teen's gaming computer is setup very close to the litter box.  I got tired of hearing him complain about the smell, so I ordered this. This is probably the best investment I have EVER made.  There is ZERO odor.  I have one cat, and we're going into week three with still zero stink.  Trust me; my teen would complain.",1
"Did not work on older dog,Bad teeth",0
"Love, love, love, this pump it's a little work horse. I only have good things to say about this pump, it cleverly comes apart for easy cleaning and very powerful, I plan on buying a second one for a pond project.  I have bought other pumps in the past from different companies, this hands down beats every one of them in all categories.",1
"I was excited to get this for Hemingway, our husky mix, because he just LOVES treat toys. He has almost destroyed his Kong (heave duty my foot) and I can't find the right treats for his Holee ball. This seemed perfect because I could use the treats we already had and stuff them in the Chuckle toy.
Hemingway would throw the toy all around the house unable to get the treat out. He would then bring it over to me to take it out for him. I love the toy BECAUSE it's hard for him to take out. This is what keeps him busy for longer than 10 minutes. I can see where it would be difficult to clean (a complaint I saw in another review) but I can probably figure out a way to get most of the grime out (either by soaking or using a small thin brush). Otherwise, I'm very happy with the toy. I love watching Hemingway toss the toy around...and the joy of him eating bits and pieces that may fall out. I can be messy this way...but worth it. I will probably get the other variety of Chuckle toys.",1
"There was so much bamboo that I could not fit it all in my tank. A great ""problem"" to have. Good quality product, nice color and overall adds to the appearance of my fish tank.",1
"I love this incubator. Very practical for raising your own babies. Will hold duck, turkey, chicken eggs as well. Very satisfied",1
"We used this product on both of our cats, within 20 minutes they were going crazy biting themselves. I had read other comments, and it sounded like a good sign... We were flea free for 1-2 days...  Gave the cats another pill each a couple weeks later, same thing... I'll give it one more go around after we bomb the house, I'll update if we have better luck, otherwise I'll be going elsewhere for flea control.",0
Delivery time and expectations exceeded!! 5 star!!,1
"If you dog has teeth, forget about it!",0
"died after 2 weeks, and we couldn't return it",0
This this was awesome for a week and then the rollers on the side that make it go quit! They slip and can't make it up to were it dumps the litter! I'm so disappointed! My cat took to it right off and I was so excited but now I'm back to cleaning it by hand! Really expensive litter box that doesn't make life any easier!,0
"I use this outstanding product in conjunction with Pet Wellbeing's ""Old Friend"" medicine for my twelve-yr. old Bichon Frise.. He also gets Glucosamine Chondroitin  and a home cooked diet. The result is nothing short of miraculous : a creaky old dog in obvious discomfort has become a bright & happy, energized, playful pup again. I am particularly pleased with the natural ingredients. I most emphatically recommend this company and their products!",1
"We use two of these on bunny cages, and now also on a bunny hutch. They clamp down nice and tight and do not move what so ever. Our bunnies - both somewhat small, though not quite dwarfs - can drink from these easily without spilling. They also seem to not leak at all even when not in use.
The flip top makes filling a breeze, and seals just fine as well. No dust or anything gets into the water bottle when it's properly shut. We also added little floating pieces so we can see easier from a distance how low the water is. Overall, we enjoy these much more than most other water bottles we've tried from PetCo, PetSmart etc.",1
I return,0
HORRIBLE. They are literally thick deflated  balloons. Not for dogs paws.,0
Cat loves these filets!,1
My dog won't use wee wee pads.he will go out in a storm first. He will use the potty patch though. Guess he feels like he is on grass. Use nature's miracle odor and stain remover to keep smell away. Just spray the pad with it well.works wonders,1
as advertised,1
"It really works quite well!
Took off a lot hair at once
Doggie hair is so soft and shiny now
Fast service",1
"Purchased via Chewy.com but is the same item as here. Item comes in two pieces. The memory foam is separate and has to be placed in the lounge via zipper. When I starting zipping up the closure the zipper came off the track and now I can't get it back on, thus the foam is hanging up. Product is no longer any good.",0
"My Bengal loves toys, especially pom pom type balls.  She loves to bat them around and carrying them around with her mouth.  And she loses many, as soon as she gets one, she loses it under the furniture.  We need to find a better way to block the furniture rather than my husband fishing them out every three days.  I have never owned a cat that loved toys as much as she does.  She's a rescue, we didn't know what was in store for us.",1
Really great bar soap..I soap up our doh and the fleas just die then rinse off her and it leaves her smelling good and soft..have purchased a second bar,1
As expected.  Only wish that these could be engraved on both sides.,1
"This cuts my German Shepherd's nose after he rolls it around. What is needed is a material more like a lacrosse ball -- hard enough that he cannot chew through it, but a little give so that it doesn't cut him. Has anyone found such a product? It's a shame to take it away from him.",0
"My dog chews and scratches all the time.  Trying supplements before prescriptions.  This did nothing for him, and halfway through the bottle he started picking it out of his bowl and leaving it on the floor!  I won't buy it again, but giving it 4 stars because it isn't the product's fault, it just didn't work for us.  We did use the stated daily dose (2 tabs twice daily for large dog).  Large tablets, but easily broken in half or even quarters just using fingers.  (I was breaking into quarters by the end so he couldn't separate it out.)",1
"Pump seems OK, tubing is useless as it was recieved full of permanent kinks",0
"My dog is about 10 years old now and had his spleen removed last year.  His health is a major concern for me.  The Healthy Daily Probiotic seems to have really improved his digestion.  Best part is, he ate it without me having to hide it or force it!  Hopefully this is one of the many natural solutions to help guide him through the aging process comfortably these next few years.",1
Was here when they said it wud be... But was not impressed with the quality of the strap... Didn't last long,0
"Have a 60 lb. rescue pit bull with extreme separation anxiety. Did not help. Have not seen any difference after wearing it, and he is on week 2 currently.  Unless the scent  it gives off actually gets stronger after wear, I do not see this working within the last 2 weeks.  I also had to sew the end onto the collar so it wouldn't slide off his neck.",0
Bags are about as thin as produce bags. You can smell the poop right through the bag. Double bagging will works. These are not premium bags.,0
"My cats used to love these, but suddenly will not touch one flavor of them, and last night the other flavor made one of my cats really sick. It seems as if they have changed the ingredients. I wanted to find out more. The manufacturer of this product advertises a customer service number with people available to talk during certain hours, but I called (several times) and it went straight to a voicemail box. They of course haven't responded to my voicemail for several weeks now, nor my online inquiries through their portal.",0
My dog loves these treats,1
Works great for my 10 gallon tank as it gives my tank a steady temperature.,1
"I have LOVED Big Boyz Chewz for the past two years. However, my recent shipments have been terribly dry. I sent an email concern and was told it was due to the crop of sweet potatoes. I decided to deal with it and made it through that bag without incident. I then ordered two more bags and, again, they were horribly dried out. This time, my dog nearly died after eating a sweet potato chew that I had cut in half for him, as usual. It got stuck in his throat and he proceeded to vomit and drool profusely atleast 12-15 times. I was on my way to the vet with him when he seemed to be getting better. I decided to lie down next to him for several hours to make sure he was alright. The only good thing is that I was able to return the Big Boyz and was issued a refund. The very bad thing is that I could have lost my dog because the product was so dried out that he was unable to swallow it without it lodging in his throat. This used to be a great product. Please stop selling it when it is overly dried out! It is extremely dangerous to dogs and can be fatal! Thank you.",0
very flimsy,0
fits perfect on my 55 gallon tank for our hog island boa.. heat resistand to his 150 watt heat lamp and its light weight it qualifies for free 2 day shipping with amazon prime wich is great !!!! worth the money i spent !!! and was cheaper than that pet place after all shipping was free here for me,1
My horse loved these!!,1
Works great!,1
In concept this is amazing - and when it works it really works. But its not very reliable. Difficult to get it to turn on properly and only 3 out of 10 times does the motion sensor work.,0
It works as an ok litter box as that is all I have on for my cat instead of the top half being installed. My cat uses the ledge to hold on while he is using the box so the top is something I realized I could not use for him. Not only that but he refused to go in due to a poor door design on the box. It could be a better product so I would not recommend it to anyone. Without the top half on the cat uses his legs when finished using the bathroom and throws the litter all over that room so this product has major problems with and without the top on and it is not something that should be sold anymore to cat owners!,0
It broke the first day. Would not recommend . It only shocked intermittently when it wanted to. And dog hit it on fence and the box broke. Not hefty.,0
Made no difference. Went through 24 pkgs. No help at all.,0
The spring doesn't work.  It keeps stopping to dispense water every other day even though there's plenty of water in the jug. Very disappointed,0
Hard to see measure mark levels,0
Best item I have purchased in recent years...removes some of the fear of trying to cut my shih zhu's hair around her eyes...thanks Scaredy Cat,1
Dogs did not like them.,0
"We bought this product for our new townhouse that we're in the process of moving into. It is supposed to accommodate dogs up to 40lbs or smaller than 18"" measured at the shoulders. If that were the case than this would have been more than enough for our basset hound who measures no more than about 14"" at the shoulders. However, the actual dog flap itself measures no more than 12"" tall and about 8"" wide. How is this expected to allow a dog 18"" AT THE SHOULDERS to fit through at all? This will probably be great for cats, and small dogs, but do yourself a favor and get the ""Large"" size that has a flap ~16"" high and ~10"" wide if your dog is any bigger than a normal sized cat. If you don't, you will be stuck spending an exorbitant amount of money on return shipping (cost me ~$29 through UPS) for who knows why. Maybe it's the awkward dimensions of the box. All I know is I should have got the Large size in the first place and saved myself some money wasted on shipping.",0
One of the few cat litters my cat loves!!,1
"for some reason dog clothes purchased overseas even within the same brand names can range wildly all over the board.....sometimes on one certain dress, a small would fit my little yorkie and then a small of another dress and it could only fit a tiny baby gerbil;.... I wish at least one storefront had consistant sizes... it doesn't matter if my 5 lb yorkie wore an extra large, just make her wear an extra large in ALL the products you offer instead of having a completely different sizing chart for each and every piece of clothing you sell.  Those would be some things that i would appreciate anyway..............................  kind regards,  ruth ann  ~",0
"The price is great for it, it has two setting (high/low) on it and only blows out cold air.
I had to return it because it is so loud and doesn't even blow out warm air, my little guy was shaking so hard because he was so cold I turned it off and pulled out my own hair dryer....",0
"I loved the regular Arm & Hammer Clump & Seal so I was anxious to try the lightweight version.  It's awful.  It's very dark, dusty, tracks EVEYWHERE, and my female Bengal peed outside the box yesterday and she NE ER does that!  I'm not waiting until the box is gone, I'm tossing it out and heading to the store to buy the old heavyweight version that both my cats and I liked.",0
"Name-brand litter at a great price and free prime shipping. Deal works great for me. One less heavy thing to try to bring home from the store, since I don't drive.",1
Looks good but does not stay on. Very disappointing.,0
"I tried another product before the Tow Leash, it literally broke on the 6th run. I am so impressed with the Tow Leash. The flexible arm and swiveling action of the snap allows for smooth  height changes from gutters to high curbs and actually protected my dog from injury when a stray dog came at us.  Cora is a 79 lb pitbull who loves all things people and fur but panicked when a dog came at us. While stopped she lunged forward then flipped over, scrambled up and twisted inward under the bar to face backwards. All of this happened in seconds. The leash held fast but swiveling prevented her from getting tangled and hurt. I highly recommend this leash. Cora goes nuts with anticipation the moment I pick up her water bottle, she LOVES running along side me. Thank you for this great product.",1
My dog loves this toy and shes very picky.,1
These bags are not as long as I would need to use for my dogs. I have 2 60 pound dogs and frequently I need to put two hands inside the back to scoop up the poop as the poop is not always firm.  Bags to short.,0
i mix some drops of it twice a day to my two dogs wet food. they love it and i believe it guards their immune system very well. i recommend it highly.,1
"The light only worked for 1-2 weeks, good idea though. "" yes I tried replacing the battery""",0
These are great! These shakers put out just the right amount of supplements on my greens. This helps to no waste as much of the supplement. Also the shakers are just so darn cute!,1
Great product,1
It broke the first time I used it. Would not retract.,0
I would definitely buy this heater all over again works great and is a great price! Couldn't be happier ...my fish too,1
"Great price, fast delivery, and product as advertised.",1
"worked for the first month,  change out the battery, and it was like it was on a low setting.  replaced the battery again and did not do nothing.  replaced with the 3rd battery and again it did not work.",0
"My dog didn't like it, but he's really picky.",0
Ends not as pointed as I'd have like.  Otherwise good pair of sissors.,1
"I bought this as a replacement for the same product that started leaking after a few months, and not 10 minutes after installing it this one leaks too! I am absolutely furious.",0
falls off after few minutes from my 4.5 lb chihuahua,0
"I used this for my pit/husky/german shepherd mix and it fit perfectly, the 8 1/2 inch was a bit too large. It's a comfortable muzzle though you'll want to take off the top strap if you're using it for over a half hour or so, it WILL rub your dogs skin raw as you can see by other commenters here! I used it for a long term muzzle and it performed admirably.",1
So very thin,0
"Cat got so hot she became ill. To make matters worse, it needed to be washed four times to get it clean.",0
"We bought this pen to attach to our large rabbit cage for our guinea pig. It's a bit odd when trying to but on the bottom/cover for the first time, but my guinea pig is so happy now.  He loves the space!  It gives us the right amount of room without having to build a large pen.  So far, so good!",1
"I have a senior cat that has kidney issues and she Loves this food.
I feed it to her more often then they say to, but she loves them and it ensures she gets enough moisture since she doesn't drink water as often as I wish she would.
It is so much cheaper then the kidney food the vet wanted me to put her on and have the same nutrition that those cans have in them!
Today blood work came back and her BUN had dropped from 50 to 45 !!",1
Dog hates this and won't eat it -spits it out even if we grind it - wasted money,0
"My girls LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  I have the typical cat sisters where they never like the same kitty food.  This was a true shocker when they both ran up to the bowl, and stayed to finish.  They both always respond when I fill their bowl, but one aways walks away after a sniff.  Leaving me to try again.  It is expensive compared to other brands, but for the health benefits and they both love it, I'm sure I'm saving money instead of buying two different kinds of foods, and on the vet bill from digestive problems.",1
I am sorry but this product is no good .my dog still have fleas. Still itching two to three days later .,0
"What a great harness.' I Love it! My puppy loved it, too.",1
Fits well. easy to put on.,1
Not  really  because  it  was  for  out  door  use  i  don't  have a dog  or  pet  i want  it  for outside  to  keep the  skunk away,0
"The downside: my cat won't go near it.  It's a shame.  My cat is picky though. No complaints with the company, only the product.",0
"We bought ours in May 2015 and had not used it that frequently and it started to crack and now is almost unusable.  My husband is going to try to repair it, but we all know that repairing plastic never works well.  I am very disappointed.",0
"Just received the product. I followed the directions precisely - putting the sensor at the base of the nail, then moving outward towards the tip until the light changed to GREEN. When I clipped the nail, my dog YELPED & started BLEEDING profusely!! Sending it back.",0
"This is not everlasting.  My dog had it destroyed, and the treat completely gone in less than 15 minutes.  Buy a Kong.",0
"The zipper came apart from the bottom up, the first time i used it. It was very dangerous, my puppy's front legs came out and I caught her before she hit the floor. The semi circle zipper was also defective. The zippers are too easily manipulated to come apart from the reverse end!! Still waiting to hear back from the company. They have not answered my request to return this item.
Update: The company reimbursed me in full and very quickly. I think the product would do better with metal zippers they are stronger!!",0
My dog can remove it.  I would suggest getting something else if you are really relying on it to stay put.,0
"Fabulous purchase. I already had one collapsible bowl when I purchased these, but it wasn't able to clip onto anything and I tend to hike/camp a lot. These turned out to be ten times better for a third of the price of the single one that I have. Their more rigid composition was certainly a lot better around my clumsy dog, and they were more light and compact so that I could just clip one onto the front of my pack.",1
I'm so happy with this product! It works wonders! Not only does it help get out stains and smeel- but it also helps lift up old stains. I was amazed when I found an old stain from a couple of weeks ago and this still managed to pick up yellow from the stain.,1
Sure wish they had told me the aquarium needs to be higher than sink level for it to drain...,0
Great,1
I use Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in conjunction with Osteo-Pet Joint care and I have seen a difference in the ease of movement exhibited by my older dog.,1
Sweet potato dog treat was rancid and moldy. I immediately requested a refund and through it in the garbage.,0
Cheaply made. The leash loop came off as soon as our ferret took off and the buckle came undo too easily allowing him to get out.,0
"Looked at all the reviews before purchasing
The good seemed to outweigh any bad....

Not the case!!

First i got a DOA timer.
Took over a month to get a new one, and once it was working the machine itself broke in less than three weeks. I got a replacement free of charge, but then the replacement lasted about two weeks before the same problem with the motor happened; bad design and build.
Now I'm stuck waiting to see if ill get another one, but I don't really want to deal with this anymore.

Lucky it didn't break while i was gone for long, otherwise who know if my cat would still be here.",0
"Got it today.  It is amazing.  Love the feel of the toy, and the sound of the toy.  My puppy enjoys it already.",1
I don't know how I lived before having this. I have a kitten in a tiny apartment and this has just made everything so much easier.,1
The fountain motor went after only 3 weeks,0
"This worked for about a week and then stopped. We replaced batteries in it several times and it drained the life out of the batteries as well. We were going to try to return it, but the return deadline just closed so now we are out of luck unfortunately. Do not recommend.",0
"i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a live person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not-so-bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dog figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!

Unfortunately, this toy is just too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dog's playtime and challenge them further.

However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.",0
Works great,1
"STUFF IS AWFUL !!!!  Tried on brand new urine stain, not only did it not get it out with using it full strength, but it made the spot 10X bigger and I think actually intensified the yellow in the urine.  I could have gotten better results by using water and Dawn dish detergent.  Tried to get a refund from Amazon and was told to contact seller.  Called ""Catherine"" over at Amerikal products no less than 5 times and didn't have the decency to call me back or attempt to resolve the issue.  STAY CLEAR AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - Even tried using this in a Rug Doctor at recommeded dilution and this ""Miracle"" stuff is worthless.  DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED !  If you have an extra $50 to waste on snake oil, send it my way, I'll gladly sell you a gallon of ""Miracle"" Water.",0
excellent bright light.,1
There was nothing wrong with this harness other than the fact that it was too stiff and heavy for my little 15 pound miniature poodle.,0
"Our young Lab/Shepard mix is tough on tennis balls. On the kind that come with a squeaker, the squeaker only lasts a couple of hours, and he has the ball torn apart within a couple of days. A regular tennis ball lasts a couple of days longer, but then they suffer the same fate. He's had these now for about two months and hasn't been able to put a dent in them. The only reason we may need to come back for more is because he loses them under and behind the furniture.

UPDATE 1/11/2014
I bought the original 2-pack of these balls in October 2013. Three months of daily play later, our guy has managed to create a rip in one of the balls, and punctured the other. Please note that this is an endorsement of the quality of the ball, not a complaint. None of the other balls we've gotten him have lasted nearly this long. So I'm back to purchase a couple more.",1
Great collar! Snap on snap off is a breeze...only thing that I found a little difficult was the initial sizing of it. I've never had a collar like this before so it took me a little bit to figure it out. Very happy with this purchase.,1
"the fish love this food....I use it for my small outdoor pond...since I leave the fish out side year round...I like to feed them well during the warm months
I only need to feed a small amount.",1
It's the only food our little Yorkie will eat. She loves it.,1
Great collar. It looks really good on my Beagle.  I love this collar. It doesn't slip and slide. Great looking collar.,1
"It is great for your dogs.  It is cheaper to get it here than at the Feed Store.  Also, easier since it is delivered to your door.",1
The ball came becomes discolored as old,0
Too thin!,0
"This collar works great on my corgi. We never use the shock setting because he is quiet after the vibration.
One of the best perks of this product is that it is waterproof. Our pup loves to swim and we were having issues finding a collar that was both water proof and had a vibration setting. Works great!",1
My cats love these,1
"Just because you choose large for a bigger dog, does not mean it actually is for a large dog! Did not fit at all!!",0
"My dog really loves this bed, and it's great for travel. This is the second one of these we've purchased over the years, and whether home or away, it gets a lot of use!",1
The lump of fur that resulted looked like my full grown cat had sprouted a kitten! The fur is SO easy to remove from the brush!,1
"i order 2 tank fish they come one in cartoon the other not in cartoon and broken

Nothing pointer about this. If possible to give 0 stars then that's what it would ger,0
The wheelchair was not sturdy enough for my Rottweiler to use. It wasn't heavey enough to bear her weight. We returned it and will try to find another one that is suitable.,0
"One of the best things I got for my dog, He was always pulling no matter how much we worked on it he just wanted to pull. I couldn't have that with my pregnant wife, he was not liking it at first trying to pull it off ""normal"" but once he realized it was not a muzzle that he could still open his mouth to eat treats and play with his toys and drink water he has grown to ignore it and welcome it when going for walks.

Was nervous at first cause he didn't like it but once you work with the instructions getting him use to having it on he was fine, its not hurting him from what i can tell have not seen any abrasions on his snout.",1
Excellent for big chewer labradoodle teenager!!!,1
"We bought this for hiking and leash training. We wanted to be able to liftt he dogs up steep rock face but it's too loose in the chest. Fits well around the abdomen as it's adjustable but the chest is too loose for my liking for the above mentioned reason. Probably great for smaller, well behaved dogs and color is true.",0
Love it- only wish I would have gotten a larger one!,1
"My vet recommended this gel to use on my dog's wounds. It is great, and lots cheaper than going to the vet every skin incident.",1
"We bought elk antlers before and those lasted up to a month. But for some reason, this antler only lasted about a week with our english bulldog.  Was hoping for something more durable.",0
"Kong Quest toys are not the same quality as Kong, I have many Kong products for my dog and this bone was chew through in about an hour. If you have a large dog or a strong chewer do not waste you money on Kong Quest items. Very flimsy quality and does not hold a variety size of treats. My dog chewed through pretty quickly.",0
Pretty tough. Still holding up no tears months later.,1
I purchased my IFetch through Kickstart when they were gathering funds to create the IFetch 2. My Daschund got beaned in the eye with it and he has NO desire to play with it. He actually runs away from it. The company will not take it back because I purchased it through Kickstarter.,0
"I was so excited to get this for my 2 cats after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, it is the worst pet product I have ever purchased. It set up nicely, and everything looked fine, but things fell apart quickly. I ordered this on Nov. 1, 2015 and by mid-December, both the top two platforms had fallen off completely. It started to get wobbly as soon as I set it up. I thought it was a screw issue so I spent a whole bunch of time re-screwing everything in, but by the next day it was loose again. My cats are 13-14 lbs each, and they're never in it at the same time, so it seems that this tree cannot even support a weight of 14lbs. Which is ridiculous. My one cat who loves being up high refused to leave the ""towers"" until it literally just fell off, so he spent the whole time slanted at a 60deg angle. Turns out it's just a matter of poor quality - I looked at the plastic thread part on the columns and the plastic has just completely worn away (yes, that quickly!), creating two HUGE holes that the screws don't fit into. This product is completely worthless unless you have one teeny tiny cat. Or squirrel. I feel robbed, what a complete waste of money.",0
THE DUST STORM IS DISGUSTING...when i go to scoop out the pooo- the dust is over whelming- will not buy again,0
"Day two and only one has gone over to it to drink.  My other cat has only checked it out but no drinking from it yet. Easy to put together. Looks nice. Since it runs all the time I should have purchased extra filters but I didn't realize it would be ""on"" and plugged in all the time.",1
"Kong to me should be strong, my dog chewed these up in less then 2 minutes, she does less damage to a regular tennis ball, and right away they shred, this is not worth the money at all, and yet she was so happy to have these and so sad to see me toss them in the garbage.",0
Big worms. The skinks liked them but she prefers other worms. I recommend these as the quality was good and shipping was quick.,1
My cat is very finicky and this is the only soft food he eats.,1
"Nylabone Dinosaur is not the same quality it used to be. Originals were softer plastic, more chewy and could be worn down. Good for teeth. This one is too hard.. Dogs won't chew on it. Original was clear dark yellow colored these are solid white. Totally useless.",0
Unhappy was way bigger than expected going to try an get a smaller one been a loyal customer for years an lately they been totally not as described not just this,0
Not for every dog,0
"I recently purchased this product at Target.  At first I was really happy with the weight, texture and ease of cleaning the litter box.  I thought I had found my new favorite litter, but after a couple of days I noticed an odor.  I thought my cat left a ""surprise"" somewhere, but my thorough search did not turn up anything.  It took me a couple more days to figure out that the odor control with this litter is ineffective.  I looked on Amazon to see others' reviews and I find that I am not alone. I clean the litter box multiple times throughout the day and there is no reason to have this odor in my home. I am switching back to Scoop Away and I will be throwing away the rest of the Tidy Cat litter.",0
"I bought the Havahart Wireless Radial Dog Fence System less than one year ago. When the system is working, it does work pretty well with very few problems (changing batteries everyday gets old quick).  Within a months time, I had to send the collar back because of water had gotten into the electronics of the collar and had stopped working. We did have a real wet spring that year and from what I could see the batteries compartment is not sealed from the rest of the electronics in the unit and water and dirt had seeped in thru the battery cap and got all over the electronics. Havahart replaced the collar in a timely manner and said it was a known problem and they were working on it. Great, but this year was different. Another wet Oregon spring brought the same problem again so I again called Havahart (only owned it 11 months at this point) and I was rudely asked if I let my dog swim in it. Duh, no!  Oregon in the spring time...rain, lots of rain. I then asked if they had fixed the problem with the battery compartment. They said they didn't know of any problems. So I figure instead of creating a sealed battery compartment that would completely fix the problem, they seam to be trying to blame the customer for any problems.  They said I had to send the collar back to the company and it would take up to three months to decide if it is their problem or not. I would NOT recommend this product in any kind of wet or dirty environment unless they get their problems fixed with the collar and the service people change their tone.",0
"My dog goes nuts for these treats, and these treats work great as training treats!! My dog gets diarrhea when she eats a bit too much of them though so I'd definitely watch the intake, but great product!",1
"My Pug puppy loves this food. She switched over to it from another brand that was not grain free with no real issues. She loves it so much she is always begging for more, however with Pugs they love to eat so I keep her on a very balanced amount she is allowed to eat each day. Her coat looks great and of course she has lots of energy.",1
"I wish I would have taken a picture of how much hair was taken off of my German Shepherd, he has long hair and weights at 100 pounds at one year old. He still has 30 pounds to put on, but I ended up taking off more than half of a grocery bag of hair. I stop because it was taking a while to get it all off.  It is worth buying but very time consuming if your dog is not brush regularly. I would try to brush your dog at least once a week",1
"looks nice, and is definitely very reflective.  but then its gone. first day my cat went outside with this and she came home without it. this is obviously made for indoor/outdoor cats, otherwise why would it need to be reflective if was indoors only? so the buckle is the weak point on this item. I know it needs to pop loose if the cat gets caught up. but it should take a little more effort than this does. falls off way too easy. now I need to buy another collar, and have another custom pet tag made, as well as go to the town hall for a replacement township license tag. so, now i have less than what I had before I bought this. :(",0
Cat loves these.,1
My cat is just delighted with this toy!,1
"This 2 in 1 has quickly become my ""go-to"" for pet stains. I LOVE the brush built into the bottle and ability to scrub the tougher stains. I previously used the Resolve brush set frequently but this is now my preference. The solution works quickly and leaves little aroma other than smelling like a clean carpet. I wish it was as easy to find in store as it is online, but Amazon has such a great price it is worth it and I plan to just add a new bottle whenever I need to increase my spending for shipping benefits! :)",1
"Loved the brush itself, but the handle began leaking clear silicone (?) on first use .  Handle should be solid rubber for best wear and tear.  Had to return for refund.",0
"This Pet Gear products seems to be the only fabric-covered two-step pet stairs on the Amazon Prime marketplace and that appeals to me.

And the stairs are completely  decent; holding 75-lbs.  My dog weighs 20...short legs...so two steps are plenty for him to get up and down from the couch or the bed (wherever we end up placing them. The positive distinctionof this product to a comparable 3-step stair on the market is basically the comfort and coordination in affords my older dog using this product to get where he needs to go.  The guy can't jump any longer - so these steps not only help but make it less painful  for him to move around.  (My dog used to stutter-step walking down from his old 3-step stairs and now that we own these 2-step stairs, he goes up and down effortlessly.) Worth the money, to say the least.",1
"Currently using on our Shih Tzu. Got the medium size and it fits her perfectly. It does not go way past her head like the ""lamp shade"" types. If you have a long snout dog (like a dachshund) I would not recommend this one.",1
"Been using this on my mini poodle who most likely has some yeast issues or perhaps a mild case of demodex.  This fights yeast on dog's skin called Malassezia pachydermatis.  Also fights candida yeast.  Shampoo frequently once a week if you are sure your dog has yeast.
Do not use this as a regular shampoo as it dries out skin too much.

Make sure your dog does not have flea allergies as this will not help.
Make sure your dog does not have demodex mites or sarcoptic mites as this will not help.
Both mites are treatable with meds.  Demodex also requires good nutrition and healthy lifestyle to treat.  Good nutrition in pets means real food - raw meat, cooked and raw veggies, sardines, fish oil, supplements, exercise, happiness, proper bathing and hygiene.

Frequently, my poodle has reddish color inside paws and on face or head.  This is caused either by iron stains from tears or saliva, or malassezia yeast that grows in moisture.  This shampoo is excellent for treating this type of yeast.  Shampoo dog, and keep massaging those areas for 10 mins before rinse and conditioner.  Repeat weekly and fix the diet.  Shave off the feet if too much hair is inside the paws, this helps a lot.",1
Too small. Returned.,0
Gives my dogs the runs.,0
It would not fit a little rat let alone my Chi. It was about 4you inches long.,0
Love it in our 75g tank. I looks great and the size is just right for our tank. Read previous reviews and figured mine would have been delivered broken like the other. But mine thankfully came all together including the mast part that usually breaks. Our catfish really love it for cover and made it their new home.,1
Works great in our cat Genie,1
American bully broke it in less then 2 minutes.,0
"Didn't get a chance to try walking with it because the plastic flip-up mechanism that sizes the nose-piece came apart, and then my dog chewed the part that fell on the floor. Up until then, she was wearing the collar while eating to get used to it as recommended, and she was OK with it. Does anyone know if a replacement clasp is available?",0
"My cats will chew through a kibble bag. They can sniff it out so I can't leave a bag in an upper cabinet or on the fridge, they will find a way to get to it. This container has an air tight seal and holds a lot of food! I can leave it on the floor by their food bowl and they never bother with it.",1
Terrible. Both burned out within a week. Will not buy again.,0
"All paws up, tail wags and happy yips from our two Bichons!  This is their favorite treat.  It helps keep their teeth clean so their humans give it two thumbs up also.  Buying in bulk saves some on the coin and the treats keep well.",1
"Furminator does a better job for my dog's breed, a Shiba Inu.  Maybe this tool is for longer haired dogs like a German Sheppard or Labrador, etc.",0
"The ad never mentioned that the material used to manufacture this bed is a thin layer of hard plastic that makes an incredible noise when my dog attempts to lay upon it, scaring my dog and everyone else in the room.  It sounds like you're squeezing a plastic water bottle,  The dog won't go near it now.  When I lay on it to try to coax the dog onto it, the fill inside squeezes flat and it feels just like I'm laying directly on the floor.  This was a giant waste of money.",0
My Pittie loves these. Now I just need to reorder!!,1
Our 80 pound mixed-breed dog broke right through the Guardian Gear 50' x 5/8 Cotton Web Dog Training Lead.  It just wasn't strong enough to hold him.  A scent of something in the forest and he was gone with 2 feet of the lead still attached to the collar and 48 feet left behind.,0
"This is the worst litter of all I've tried. Our cat is long haired and it sticks to his tufted paws like anything. I'm afraid my cat has swallowed a whole bunch of this litter as he tries to groom this crap off his legs. The other problem for us is having hardwood floors and this is very fine grain. So when it spreads across our floor and someone steps on it, it just completely rubs on the floor. I've had some that can scratch the floor but dont' break down so easily. Between the two evils I'll take a very low probability of scratching than constant staining of the floor by this product.",0
The Cat Tree Condo came in a damaged box and the House was smashed - almost beyond repair - both sides were broken. Since there was NO invoice or contact number - I decided to repair the house myself - instead of trying to contact the seller and request a new house. Overall the Cat tree was a bit small and the posts holding both platforms became loose and unstable after a few days of use. Finally I placed 3 screws directly into / thru each post and that improved the stability. Overall poor quality build and not rigid enough for even small kittens,0
"I didn't realize how small this was. My dog is a Pom so I thought it would be cute on her. Too bad this little jersey wouldn't even fit on a kitten. I requested a refund, but I don't feel like going through the trouble of mailing it back, so I'll just keep it as Kobe gear and hopefully one day I'll get a parakeet that can fit it.",0
I wish I had this years ago.  It is simple to put together and oh so easy to dispose the waste.  This has to be one of my best purchases ever.  Thanks for the innovation!,1
Perfect food for perfect dogs.,1
Only worked  for 7 months.,0
"This bed is advertised as having memory foam.  Ok, so there actually IS some there - but come on people.  The memory foam is so thin that I thought about using it as a pancake for breakfast.  I mean, seriously - you cant even tell the difference between this bed and a cheap one from the dollar store (assumption made as I don't shop at the dollar store, just Amazon). Sent it back.",0
The cheaper one piece rod is far better than this one if your cat tugs on the feathers during play. Mine tugs and the rod comes apart which could be dangerous for kitty. One piece toy is fabulous though,0
"I find this feeding station to be somewhat hard to fill.  I like it, many more finches gather here than the other feeder I have.",1
"These are seriously the best potty pads I have ever used and I have tried just about every brand.

"Used Oxbow brand pellets for years, however I am not happy that it has Soy, Wheat & Molasses in it. Those are unnecessary & very unhealthy fillers that cause health issues! Shame on you Oxbow! Glad I switched to Sherwood brand pellets.... SO MUCH HEALTHIER AND FRESH SMELLING!",0
5 days waiting for about 5 minutes of play. Sadly these didn't hold up for long.,0
These little aquariums are neat but the need to be wider than tall. Fish swim from side to side a lot more than they swim up and down. It does work as advertised but it's much too small and the water should be changed at least every other day because it is so small. I moved my guy into a larger aquarium and he is much happier. $89 is crazy! You can set your little guy up in a  much nicer tank for lots less than that!,0
Worse ball I've ever bought my dog. One bite and there's a hole in it. Horrible!,0
"Their customer support is awful. My tracker quit working 3 weeks ago and they've made me do everything from pressing buttons, to power cycling the base station, to moving the plug, to taking pictures of the pins on the tracker/base station...none of this has helped. The tracker is dead and they won't do anything to help me. They stopped replying to emails a week ago. You'd think they would ship you a box to return your broken devices, then immediately send you a replacement, and then they can troubleshoot the device on their own time. Instead they've wasted almost a month of my time and money trying to troubleshoot an obviously broken device. If I can ever get ahold of them again, I will be asking for a refund of the device and the year of service that I've paid for already.",0
"The product itself is outstanding. Very durable. Very comfortable. I use these covers on 2 dog beds and they have cut down the hair and dirt in my house by 80%. I change them every two weeks. I don't have to get my washer and dryer full of pet hair by washing pet bed covers anymore. I used my Prime Account and was extremely satisfied. No more!  Not Prime availabile anymore. Now I have to pay $17.99 shipping on a $19.99 item!!  It isn't a bulky package and is very light, so why do I have to pay almost double on a product??  With the exclusive, now Novopet can extort me. Deplorable business ethics. You got me buying from you, Novopet, but you do not have my respect or loyalty; I'll jump ship if I can find anything comparable.",0
My dogs get so excited to have these treats!,1
"Size was advertised as XL with a german shepard photograph, Once recieved did not fit my golden retriever with smaller chest than a shepard.",0
"Poor Paws for Four Paws

Because of food and other sensitivities in my family, i now check ingredients in products and foods.
Imagine my surprise when I discovered that after water, the second ingredient in magic coat is propylene glycol, an antifreeze product. It is banned in cat food, but not dog food.  The third ingredient is nonoxynol-9, a product that an NIH study found evidence of carcinogenic when fed to dogs and cats.

Since my dogs will lick everything off them and me, I have decided to err on the side of caution. I rate this a one.

broken - very poor packing plastic bottom was cracked and chipped - returned the item. Had it been packed well would have been nice,0
"Every time I go to someones house for the first time, I make sure to say I'm going to the bathroom and immediately head to their bedroom to ""Check The Sheets""... It works great and has the added bonus of letting me know I need to get new friends OR more hand sanitizer.",1
it worked well but because you have to twist it to turn it on and off it loosened and fell off and was lost,0
Great food (just look at the ingredients!) our dogs love it,1
Too big for my dog,0
Very cheap quality.  Seller doesn't offer returns.  very disappointed.,0
It's huge! But we are very satisfied. Easy to assemble! Our cat loves it and went right to it. :),1
Although this harness appears to be well made we had to return it. We have a 9# shih tzu and ordered the small. His head wouldn't  fit thru the neck opening. Even the medium would not have fit over his head. If you have a dog with a small head like a chihuahua I'm sure you would be able to use it.,0
"This helps, but I prefer the tear stain remover from Omega Pet. This helped my white mini poodle to lose the tear stain around the eyes. I'm not 100% certain that this is the product that solve the issue. I can say it helps. I have used many other tear stain products. I like the smell of Omega pet better than the tear stain remover from Betta Bridges Pets",1
It's nice and long and probably overkill on my 25 pound dog.  Only complaint is how loud it is as it retracts and extends.,1
"I do not recommend buying the grapevine from Zoo Med I read other reviews and I thought I would take a chance and hope I got lucky but I was far from lucky with what I received. The piece is long, 22 inches but at its thickest its only 4 inches in diameter, and there are 3 skippy pieces sticking out all less than 4 inches. The worst part however was the actually quality of the wood, as you see in the picture is has horrible discoloration that seems to be from mold and mildew growth. I wouldn't trust it to have in my enclosure buy any means. I've owned reptiles for a while and used grapevine many times. The difference is, I have always bought in person. This the worst example of grapevine I have seen and I recommend trying another source or only buying in person.",0
Glad to have found a hypoallergenic pet shampoo with conditioner.  My dog has allergies and long hair and the conditioner will especially help during the winter months.  Arrived as scheduled.,1
This is the one designed for the terrarium my wife has. It works amd is the correct size and color.,1
THEY ARE THE BEST!,1

Does not work as advertised! Do not buy,0
"I made the mistake of purchasing not 1 but 2 of these hutches. They look nice but are made of wood that probably will not last the winter and won't look nice for long. There is not a wire floor for the rabbits. Are they suppose to sit in thier poop? I have tried to get Amazon and Petco to answer this concern,but obviously I will have to eat the cost to buy the material and finish these cheap made and incomplete products. I highly recommend not purchasing this product,and don't expect either of these companies to stand behind their product.",0
"Doesn't actually seem to help our 15 y.o. cat's digestive issues. Many other variables, though.",0
"I can't comment on the quality of this product, as my now 12 week old Labradoodle has absolutely no interest in this toy. Since she's been teething, and will pretty much bite on anything and everything, I thought this would be great for her. She nudged at it just once and never looked at it again.",0
"This did not work well, it was not bright enough and holding the button down hurt my hand.",0
The xl arrived and to my surprise would only fit a dog the size of a shi tzu.  Returned.,0
Broke within a week of using them. Very cheaply made. Save your money.,0
My rabbit and guinea pig love these treats. Every time my guinea pig hears the bag she gets excited and squeaks very loudly.,1
Loved it!! Very sturdy!,1

This jacket is cute as can be but the band that goes around the dog is WAY TOO BIG.  So I couldn't really tighten it around my dogs waist.  I was going to fix it myself but never got around to it so it just sat in my dog's clothes bin.,0
"This litter box is the best value for a self-cleaning box. Other self-cleaning litter boxes are double the price.

The litter boxes are very easy to set up. It only took me a few minutes.

The litter box works as advertised. It's as easy as rolling the box over and opening the little drawer. This is so easier and more hygienic than scooping!

Overall I'm pleased with this product and would recommend it.",1
Puppy could care less about this toy. Oh well...,0
The description of the product on Amazon said:  Product Dimensions: 17.5 x 13.5 x 17 inches.  The actual product I received has the dimensions of 19.3 x 15 x 11.8.  This is not what I wanted and completely useless to me.,0
"Don't buy this product.  I've tried two (shame on me) from the same manufacturer, and in both cases the LEDs stopped changing colors within a few weeks, and then stopped coming on at all within a couple months. The bubbler portion works fine, but the lights are inexcusably bad.",0
Doesn't work,0
"The good, the pan is actually wide and seems to catch small solid waste.

The bad, the grate-ridge on the pan is diagonal which makes the sand sift out at slower rate than straight grates.

The Ugly, (the achilles heel) the pan is attached to a metal rod, the metal rod is inserted in to the rubber handle. The metal rod however is 2 inches shorter than the rubber handle which makes the handle bend when you are sifting.  It is guaranteed that the bend will eventually fatigue the rubber handle in to shreds.  Imagine if your frying pan's handle bent every time you went to pick up the pan!  The sensation is the same here.  AVOID.",0
Nice item but poor customer service.,0
"Works great, I love that's it's all natural",1
"well it looks like the contents of the supplements R good milligram wise, unfortunately my dogs just don't like them. They won't eat them. Also, the consistency is very crumbly which I can't decide if that is a good or bad thing. But I have to do with this is crumble it up and mix it in with my dogs homemade food they get every night for dinner. So, ultimately it gets the job done. Sounds like a very confusing review because I'm a little confused on the product myself. Would I buy it? Probably not for the price. you see. But, it all depends on how long the entire bag last May. If it is cheaper than the liquid supplement I was using before, I will purchase this again. If that is the case, I will come back and edit my review.",0
This bowl is great! My puppy was scarfing his food down in about 45 seconds.  With this bowl he has slowed down his eating so that it is taking him about 3 minutes to finish and it has reduced his bloat. I would recommend to anyone who needs to slow down a fast eater.,1
"I'm disappointed that after 1 use, a headrest strap has come completely unstitched.

"I had high hopes seeing how I uses so many other Kayree products but I am very much disappointed. Three times I have tried the 96 ounce bags of hay and all three times the hay has come with mushroom spores in it! Within two days of putting the hay out mushrooms grew in my rabbits' litter boxes! Not only is this disgusting but it is also deadly! Mushrooms are toxic to rabbits!
Do not buy this product!!!",0
I don't know why my crickets are so picky but they would NOT eat this stuff.  They acted like it wasn't food and didn't come near it the way they used to go to the Flukers Cricket Quencher. I was afraid they'd cannibalize each other so I put oats and veggies in there instead. Too bad I wasted my money buying 2 bottles of this.,0
Not very happy. Boots are too small. Made for a stuff puppy or newborn puppy. Maybe sizes should be explained better.  Thankyou Danita Meek,0

Great product.  I just wish the strap for the door was adjustable.  My maltipoo cannot reach the bottom bell....,1
Not the usual quality that I have come to expect from Flexi over the years. The product is functional so I will be keeping it.  It's OK.,1
i got mine today and when it showed up it was a couple strands of dying moss tied to a coconut. Would definitely not recommend buying.,0
To Thin No Good Kathy,0
"It seemed like a cool idea, as does most of their products but this one wasn't as great as I had hoped.  The enclosure seems sturdy enough and it's super easy to install.  My only problem is with the boxes they provide.  There is two parts to the boxes.  One simple rectangular box and then an insert for that box.  The outer box is ok, it's just a rectangle but the inside piece, which is meant to separate the food or treats is terrible.  They never stay  in the correct position and they usually just collapse.  I'm not going to continue using this product and from now on I'll just make my own foraging box.

Also, they say to change the box every day but it's not necessary.",0
Doesn't fit any ashes.,0
I've had my 90 # tripod on this since she cranked her knee several years ago. I think it definitely helps to keep her mobile. She loves the chews and they double as pill holders for her evening thyroid meds. They're soft and moldable and she loves them.,1
Good perfum,1
"I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.  I give him his medication and then immediately give him the treat.  (not in the same fashion, however)  He used to run and hide every time I opened his pill case now at least he sticks around.  It makes it easier for me too.",1
"I ordered the K9 Ballistics TUFF Bed Crate Pad Blue - X-Small (30""x19"").
The pad is thin and there isn't much stuffing to it.
The dog might as well be laying on the floor it's so thin.
The pad is smaller than the advertised 30""x19"" size that I purchased.
I received it yesterday (09/09/14). Today (09/10/14) it was chewed through by my 25 pound dog while I was at work.
It's not worth the $45 cost in my opinion.
Mind you, the cost varies based on size.
I'd like to add a couple pictures here, but there isn't an option for it.",0

"This kennel assembles with ease. It's not overly heavy, nor too light weight - right on the middle. Pebbles is used to using a kennel so we will never be in the position to share personal experience related to puppies or dogs that chew or scratch attack their kennel.

Not that palatable. Have to hide inside the food. Seems to work fine,1
"The squeaker was gone in 30 minutes or less. And our dog lost interest at that point.

"First off, only one of my dogs consistently wanted to use this....and he loved it.  The other one used it every now and then...she acted as if she had a problem with it, perhaps it made her feel odd.  (you know...how a dog will refuse food if it associates it with not feeling good?)

But the problem I have with this system is that it increases the amount of air that gets into a dog's system at mealtime.  We strive to eliminate the ingestion of air to the extent possible...it's a factor in bloat...and this obviously counteracts any other efforts to that end.  My dogs burp and burp after using this (it's not just the ingredients in the liquid causing distress...they can have that off my finger and be just fine)...and sometimes the burps will bring along the contents of the stomach.

It took me a while to figure out what was going on....but it was real easy to test.  Yep....licking the paddle causes the ingestion of air.

Bye bye lickies....",0
Eh. This doesn't work at all.,0
"The weight you stated for this Booster Seat to me seems way off one of my dogs that is only six pounds is way to big for this booster seat and

This product did not come with a stand and when I attached it to the cage it did not spin.,0
"I don't know why my dog doesn't seem to really like these, I thought he would and for some reason it makes me mad cuz they smell better and look better than all those other treats, okay this may be gross but I went so far as to kind of taste one a little bit and they didn't taste bad at all but for some reason he has never liked any kind of hard dog bones, unless it's a real bone or rawhide and I don't understand why.  These smell so good and he likes the stinky ones.  I want him to like these so bad, I don't know why but I just do.  I mean he ate one but barely and slowly.  I even broke some up and put in his food and he did eat them but he doesn't seem to prefer them at all.  It just bugs me because I don't understand why.  I would eat them if I was a dog. He just has never liked any kinds of bones like this, even other brands and I have no clue why because I wish he did because you can buy a GIANT bag of these for like six bucks and that would save me alot of money.  He loves to chew on rawhide bones of any kind so why wouldn't he like these.",1
"The door zips shut. Our dog (a 13 week old lab) has already figured out how to scratch at the zipper to open the door, and chew everything in the house while we are away or sleeping.

"I can't recommend this product. I have put it outside to air out since the day I received it. The chemical they use to stop mold, etc., is over powering. Stick your head in it and take a deep breath. I guarantee you will have second thoughts about letting your pet sleep in it.",0
Seems to do a good job of picking up the gifts my dog leaves me in the yard. Not much else to it!,1

This toy makes my 3 month old French Bulldog very happy. He loves that he can carry it around and that it rattles instead of squeeks. He's had it for almost a month and has yet to do any damage to it.,1
"Was nice for a few months, but soon broke/ripped where the velcro seat-belt holes are - these are a bad idea.  Also, the plastic clips on the straps which hold it up broke one by one, they're not very durable.",0
"The crystals only worsened the smell of ammonia in my home and were tracked out of the box everywhere no matter how many mats I put down. If you inadvertently stepped on one they crush and make an even bigger mess! To avoid the smell I had to replace crystal box every few days to a week and that can get pricy at ~$20/3pk. In the box itself, there weren't many crystals at all and often my kitty would be digging wide empty areas with no crystals because the layer was so thin (which I think contributed to the ammonia smell). It's also awkward to throw away - throwing away this big box every week. The rakes also clump with kitty poo - requiring a good manual clean every so often.

Otherwise, my tabby wasn't the least bit scared to use it and would happily go within a day. I don't see timid cats (like Persians) adjusting to this very well but I'm sure your results will vary. In every other way it worked as expected. I personally prefer something that works with regular litter but I'm sure that this works well for some people - just not me.",0
THEY DIDN'T SCREW THE CAP ON!! The product was leaking everywhere !,0
"WARNING: after we gave this to our Lab over several days, we noticed she was oozing blood from her eyes and mouth. Her platelet levels were extremely low. The vet thought it was infection or cancer. We did not make a connection with this product.

The package carries warnings regarding dogs with clotting disorders or that are on anticoagulants. Our dog was not on anticoagulants and in 12 years was never diagnosed with a clotting disorder.

This is a potentially dangerous product for your dog. It is not worth the risk, in my opinion.",0
"Definitely a quality made product but fairly easy for a bigger dog to flip the cone backwards or bend it out of the way.
Bought for my 80lbs black lab who was neutered and had eye surgery at the same time. Once the stitches started to itch his eyes he was able to push down on the cone hard enough to move it out of the way and able to scratch his eyes on the ground thus resulting in a scratched cornea.
Best to stick with the standard tough/obnoxious plastic one your vet will give as this was immediately useless and ended up costing another $100 in vet bills.",0
"My 4-month-old puppy is under 20 pounds and will probably stay in that range. At the breeder's recommendation, we put the original steel crate in a central location in our house, and bought this lightweight crate to use temporarily in our bedroom. She loves the crate and it has been a dream to use and maintain. It is also easy to secure in the back seat of the car, so she is ready for long-distance travel in safety and security. My husband says it was a great investment and we are all very satisfied.

I look forward to using this crate for overnight trips, since it will allow the dog to feel safe in unfamiliar surroundings such as hotel rooms. Some hotels require a crate, and this is a wonderful collapsible, lightweight option. (Being able to keep one or more zippered flaps rolled up and open is a real bonus.)

I will mention that the first night our dog was gnawing on the interior of the crate but (fortunately) she quickly lost interest. If she had been more persistent, she could have done some damage. We now put a couple of chew toys in with her at night, so they keep her focus away from any activity that would damage the crate.",1

"My dog suffers from minor allergies, and sadly, this shampoo seemed to exacerbate them, with lots of itching.",0
I don't think this product is worth the money. It is not very durable and my dog had it torn apart in short order. I much prefer the nylon flexible frisbee which throws a lot better and my dog doesn't destroy it. And it is cheaper.,0
"Superior product. Very high quality material. Easy to use. Great fit. Quite adjustable. Washes up very well. For my dog, a little more room for the tail seemed to be needed and so I purposely stretched out the hole for the tail a little, but this is likely not an issue for dogs with a more slender frame than my dog's.",1
"It's called a Kitty Convict collar, but when adjusted for average sized cats the plastic adjustment tab covers part of the embroidery. If you're lucky your cat will be so small or you'll be in an area not needing an area code so that the plastic tab only covers the name. If you're unlucky (like me and quite a few others) it covers the phone number on the 6th and 8th digit. And even my largest cat didn't have much of a neck larger than my smallest cat (15 vs 8 lbs) so the number would still be cut off.

This means if my cat got out, someone would have to catch her and check the collar before calling me. She's not the most open to strangers so I can guarantee you she wouldn't let someone grab her. So now I have to pay shipping back for their bad design to get some of the money back. It's disappointing.",0

Perfect toy for the dog.,1
My little dog can jump right out of it. She's a very content dog but she didn't want to stay in this. She looked kind of big in it even though she's only 8 lbs. and low to the ground. I'll just stick to a seat belted harness for her.,0

"these really work!!!! my dog is able to walk and be mobile while on these. we tried others that didn't work as well, like Dancing Paws.",1
"I am on my second one but that is partially due to my own mistake. I didn't realize that the clear bottle is not dishwasher safe. For a very long time I would always just hand wash, but one lazy day I decided to just let the dishwasher do all the work. Bad idea. The whole thing melted and warped. It is a great product if you don't mind the hand washing.

I recommend this to everyone I know who has multiple dogs or even a single large dog. No more worrying about remembering to fill up the water bowl each day. I fill it up about every three days.

The only issue I have with the product is the gimmicky charcoal filter. FYI - do not count on this doing much for the water. I take it out and just use sink water without the extra filter. The filter severely restricts the flow of the water and it leaves little charcoal dust particles in the water. Not a good feature on an otherwise good product.",1
"Pink on your boy kitten? Perish the thought, right?
WRONG!
I have 2 male cats under a year old and both are now sporting these pink claws. Why? I CAN SEE FROM ACROSS THE ROOM THE SECOND ONE IS MISSING!! Being kittens, they are both learning to behave in the house... they are good cats but not always. These keep my things from being ripped up! With this bright of a color I can tell the second a cap is missing and can replace it.

I wish the company would create brighter colors such as this. Think glow in the dark or neon!!!",1
"This is one of the most heavy duty and quality made dog leashes I have ever used. I am simply in love with it! I haven't ever used a retractable dog leash before, but now I would never go back after trying this one. My dog likes to jump and bite at the leash when I take him out to go to the bathroom and for walks. However, now he can no longer do that because when he reaches to bite at this leash, it retracts in and keeps it straight so he has nothing to bite at. Also, I love the length, especially in this frigid weather we are having. I can open the door, let my dog out, and then close the door to just a crack and he can run up to 16 feet away to use the bathroom. That way I don't have to be freezing outside while waiting on him to use the bathroom. The quality seems like it will last for years and years and is heavy duty so I know it is made for my big dog that is about 80 lbs. I also love the grip handle so that it won't slip out of your hand. Finally, the buttons to lock and unlock the leash from extending or retracting are in a perfect spot and easy to use. Overall I would rate this 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend this to anyone with a dog!",1
great,1
Cats love the food.,1
It fits good to my puppy so cute christmas outfit,1

"I wish I could give negative stars! This product is a perfect example of how a company cuts corners to the point that the product really doesn't work anymore. The instruction sheet is designed for two different products, one on each side. Great, they saved money on printing. Then, there's no real instructions, just some pictures that don't really show how the joints work. Then, there's the joint couplers themselves. They're a joke. Rather than designing custom joint couplers that work really well for this particular frame, they went with some crappy, one-size-fits-all aluminum couplers that aren't designed to handle the intricate stresses of this framework. YOU HAVE to provide your own screws and drill these poles so they won't twist and fall out of the couplers. It doesn't matter how tight you tighten the coupler screws. The poles will still twist. The tightening screws on the short poles, which should be used to adjust your width a little, if your kennel is a little off on specs, are fused. They're just there for looks. I ordered this in the early spring and missed my return window for returning it, not to mention the cheap ass box ripped apart anyway. I will never order a ""LUCKY DOG"" product again. I am completely unimpressed with this company and their willingness to short change their customers to make a buck.",0
"We had purchased 2 of these cages 5 years ago when we brought our conure home...one parrot sized and one cockatiel sized that she sleeps in.  Those 2 were very good quality for the price, especially since she spends a lot of time out of the cage.  We needed another cage for travel so thinking I would get the same quality, I ordered this one.  Not the same at all!

- The overall construction does not seem as solid as the previous Penn Plax cages we have.
- the dishes are small, seemingly way too small for a cockatiel, definitely too small for my Green Cheek conure who is slightly smaller than a Tiel.
- the way the food doors are positioned on the bottom side, it makes it difficult to place her toys and perches so she doesn't accidentally poop in her dish.  We are opting to use stainless steel dishes and holders that we will position towards the top of the cage.
- wood perches fit loosely...I have replaced them with rope perches.
- the sand perches don't even fit in the cage.
- the front door on my older cages have a latch and hook to securely lock the door.  The way this new one works, where the cage door snaps into the cage, seems like it will loosen over time.  Plus the paint scratches off right away.
- The food doors do not lock as the ones on my older cage do.  This will not be good for any escape artist birds.  Since we will not use them, we will permanently secure them somehow.

Since this is a cage we are not using regularly, I am keeping and making do.  I would NOT recommend this cage as a primary cage for your bird - invest in something sturdier, safer and more thoughtfully designed.  It may serve well as a sleep cage.",0
Works great. Stars deducted for price creep. Should be 11-12 $ in my opinion. It should be in bold letters that it is pointless to use this on wet urine.,1
Very cute and wish they stayed on better.,1
Not worth the money.,0

"These bones LOOK and FEEL similar to Merricks GI Bone and look sturdy and an alternative to Red Barn bones but BEWARE, they are extremely brittle to medium/large dogs (3 GSDs 2 Labs). They easily splinter and break into pieces quickly  within the first hour.

This is a piece of crap.  I have barely had it 60 days and it goes out.  The warranty was up 2/1/17 & it went out on 2/13/17.  When it did work it was very noisy & I was constantly filling it up.  Not happy at all!,0
"I bought this self-cleaning litterbox because it was more quiet and moved less than the other types, which made it less likely to scare my cat. It didn't last two weeks before it broke beyond repair. The motor simply couldn't move the litter clumps into the bucket. This litterbox is continous, meaning that it cleans and moves every minute in very small amounts that hopefully go unnoticed by your cat (although mine did not like the click of the box rotating every minute, so he barely even used it). It would be a smart design, if it had more power and better parts, but it doesn't and not even my husband (an engineer) could repair it once it stopped working. This was an expensive mistake and I plan to give the company a piece of my mind. Don't waste your money.",0

"This product didn't last an hour with our dog. He chews up regular tennis balls pretty quick as well, but I thought the name and product description meant they would last a little longer.

No Drip??? I filled this up and my dog drank out of it once. From there on it did nothing but drip. Thank goodness I was washing her bed at the time and notice a big water puddle. I just watched it drip and drip. I tried seeing if something was caught between the ball and the tube but nothing was. I returned this and I'm going to look elsewhere.,0

"Once I finally got the product, it has worked well. Just frustrated that it took 30 days to arrive and would've liked that information upfront (I guess it was hand made) and the cost seemed a bit inflated especially when you add in shipping and handling.  $ 40 bucks for a cat diaper!  It was produced in Iowa and took 3 days to get here, does that warrant $ 8 shipping and handling, I don't think so! Overall inspite of the high cost, its a great product.

Great way to bathe the dogs without breaking your back. After a few times the dogs volunteer to jump up into the tub. I changed the sprayer for a standard multi-spray style nozzle because I like it better. But the unit is great and worth the investment.,1

"These clippers worked like a charm... And my dogs don't usually let me trim their nails without a fight. The clippers didn't cause any splintering if the nails (which has happened in the past with other clippers) and this allowed me to cut their nails quickly for less trama. Per the recommendations on the package, I did bath my dogs first which allowed for the nails to become softer and thus easier to clip.",1

"These are not made in the USA, if there were they would clearly state it on the bag.  The name of these treats are, in my opinion, misleading.  The company is just based in Vermont.  I recently purchased this brand and gave them to my 8 year old dog.  Within weeks she died in her sleep.  Obviously I do not know for sure if this brand contributed to this or it was a coincidence.  All I know it is hard not to believe it with everything on the news lately about treats killing our dogs that are from or contain Chinese ingredients.  Recently Petco and Petsmart announced they will not sell any chinese treats anymore.  If you care for your pet pay more to get USA made and US ingredients or just don't give them any.

Update:  I wrote an email to pet naturals and specifically asked where the treats are made and what countries there ingredients originate from.  There answer was their treats are manufactured in the US but the ingredients are from around the world.  They would not specifically list which countries they are from.  They did acknowledge though that the majority of the ingredients come from China.  Also they stressed that safety of the ingredients are used, but what company doesn't claim this.  I'm sure you can contact them yourself through email and receive the same generic email.",0
"The last cover melted in the dishwasher.  I was loath to pitch it though because the handle of a spoon fit so nicely through the melted gap.  But alas, Daddy didn't want THAT! So Sparky got these in his stocking and now Daddy is happy.",1
"Super cute. Very soft. I bought this for my cat. She doesn't really use it, BUT the dog totally does. He is an 8 year old, 10 pound Chihuahua. Total lap dog. Loves to be with us, on us. He digs this. I put him in it when I'm using the computer. It holds him right on me.",1
Stinky and visually unappealing! My dogs won't eat it.,0
It's just a collar with plastic spikes on the inside. I have a very high strung 8 month old Cairn Terrier who tugs a lot on a leash and runs to greet people. I was very concerned he would hurt himself because the spikes were on the bottom by his throat. I only tried it 3 times & it didn't seem to deter him but frightened me. I'm not using it.,0
dogs love it,1
Super durable. Our dog can't get enough.,1
"Sturdy,  well-made product. I purchased the midsize snoozer for my 5 1/2 pound dog any smaller would not have worked",1
My dog isn't crazy about these.,0
"Filters clog up in about a week with 2 turtles and no gravel... The pump starts getting problematic over time. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra on a canister filter (You will save money, time, and cleaning in the long run.) This is just a scam to get you to continuously buy overpriced junk filters to constantly put into a junk product. Also it severely limits your water level in your tank. If you have a small tank it takes up all the room. If you have a larger tank, you will change filters every week (2 filters at a time while they sale them in the packs....) Also there are really cool DIY systems you can make yourself that will work and last a million times longer and probably even cost less than this junk product.",0
"Complete waste of time, money and space, my dog was convinced it was made by aliens and that if she laid on it they'd brain wash her and turn her into a cat.",0
Meets the vet's requirements and price was right this one time.  But price  is up a bunch so had to find another source for this product.,1
I see tremendous improvement in my 12 year dog whose hind legs are giving out.  Decidedly energetic.,1
"FANTASTIC leash!! Looks, feels, works and smells great! Fast shipping, careful up packaging and good customer service.",1
"Had to return this, because it was too scratchy on my sensitive pibble's skin.  Cute, though, would have loved to keep it.",0
large?,0
"My small chihuahua LOVES this bag...I take her shopping and she jumps right in! Made well, and sturdy. If you want something stylish to carry your small dog this is a great price and great find!",1
"We just started with this product, and I can't really tell much after using these only a few weeks. One thing we do know that our dog seems to like the product and it seems to be helping her with limping when she gets up from her resting spot. I do recommend this product.",1
"AWESOME carrier.  Totally worth the price.  I bought the large carrier for 22 pound pets and I was immediately impressed by the quality.  The carrier is folded when you first get it, but after adjusting the fleece insert it perks right up and is incredibly sturdy.  I'm very glad I decided to return the cheaper carrier I bought and purchased this one.  The gray is a nice color too and is very true to picture, the straps are very thick and sturdy, carrying your pet over the shoulder will be no problem.

Overall I'm very impressed with the quality of this soft carrier.

We bought this for our new boy cat, but our smaller female tabby who has an older carrier LOVES sitting in this one.  I plan on, buying another Sherpa for her.  Cat approved :)",1
My Yorkie won't touch it at all. Disappointing  I was really hoping she would like it. All the ingredients are very healthy and the company has very good reviews.,0
"Item delivered on time, was as described.",1
Not very high quality. Edges were sharp and coating was coming off when it arrived. I never put it on my dog.,0
"Nice price , got it for my baby  King snake as a starter tank.",1
"I teetered between a four and five star review. I can't say I ""love"" the product (its just fine) but I definitely love the company. I've only used it once so far and it really did the trick for my cats: durable, comfortable (with added padding), and secure. If I'm being picky, the only reason why I felt a little unhappy with the product is because once its totally zipped up you can only open one end at a time. I understand that this carrier is great for storage as it unzips completely and goes flat, but at first I was a little concerned that I couldn't have open both the front and back at the same time- I like to leave the carriers out sometimes for the cats to play in and run through and they can't with these. Regardless of this, the people at Pet Magasin have top-notch customer service and that means everything to me. I am very happy about my purchase with this small business and will always recommend them in the future.",1
My labs tore this apart in minutes. waste of money if you have dogs that love to chew,0
"I couldn't get it to work.  I ended up returning it.  I did exchange e-mails with the manufacturer, but it would have been better if there were a phone number I could call so that I could talk to a live person.",0
Easy to install. My dog loves it. He is able to move about while being secured with his harness on. I was able to use in front seat and back seat.,1
So happy with this litter! best odor eliminator ever! Do not let the small size fool you! This is a keeper!,1
"I ordered this dog bed for a quick overnight trip with my dog, not expecting much for the price. I was very surprised at the quality of the foam - it's firm, yet supportive. It doesn't sink to the floor when I step or sit on it (I weigh 140 lbs). This bed is actually of much better quality than my dog's regular ortho bed from Chewy that cost 3x as much. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bed I received was grey and not green as pictured. The cover also does not seem to be that great of quality, and I don't see it holding up well wash after wash.  My dog is a18 lb mini poodle with long legs and is about 24 inches long from her head to the base of her tail. She fit perfectly.",1
Really works at slowing down my dog during feeding time.,1
Didnt really get rid of fleas. I still had to wash the dog 3 times a week for months.,1
"This dog bed was purchased for a large lab-x . The bed lasted about 3 months, then it bunched up in many areas and was so uncomfortable, that my dog preferred to sleep on the porch slats over the bed. I ended up throwing it away and bought a better made bed for my pooch.",0
Not good for anxious cats. Too small for fat cats.,0
"Don't waste your money on other brands of dog toys.  If your dog likes to chew this is the toy.  These are almost indestructible.  We also have the red Kong classic, but our dog was able to start a small tear in it and destroy part of it.  There is a hole in it to put peanut butter or a treat.  Given time a dog might be able to work a piece off, so you might want to monitor if you keep the toy out.",1
Excellent quality and perfect fit for my little Appy mare.  I didn't think I'd find something as nice as her old Rambo turnout Wug.,1
my cats  love  it,1
"Seat cover is to small/narrow and won't cover seat completely (medium size sedan). Initial quality impressions are good, however, it doesn't fully protect your seat and defeats it's purpose",0
Love the design and quality of this placemat. Keeps my carpet clean and spill free.,1
My Toby loves it! He was recently diagnosed with arthritis and it helps him a lot so he won't be in pain when ttying to eat. He is a German Shepard mix.,1
"Surprised to see negative review; I thought the idea was to slow them down, not make it impossible.  I've been using my large size for 2 years, just went on line to order a 2nd for new puppy because the original works so well & is getting so much use, I know it'll get lost and I don't want to be without it!  I stick a Get Naked chew stick all the way thru and throw it on my way out, or when I need 10 minutes of puppy peace.  I love that it's rugged enough to still look brand new, but soft enough that it bounces and it apparently is more pleasant to chew.  Please don't discontinue!!!",1
"This collar did not help my cat with seperation anxiety or excessive meowing. Also, i was petting my cat and noticed tiny bumps on her head, back of neck and around the back of her ears. When i took the collar off there were little bumps all around her neck. Its concerning. So check your cats because they have very sensitive skin. I will be taking her to the vet tomorrow.",0
I dug as deep a hole as I could in my back yard for this item. Not only did it not drain because there is too much clay content in my soil. I was constantly tripping on it when mowing the lawn and it broke very easily. Overpriced garbage. The digester poweder did not break the fecal matter down any faster than just hosing it either. What a horrible smell eminated from it!,0
"My kitty liked it, but it did a number on his digestive system. He threw up for 3 days and left weird deposits in his litter box. I stopped feeding it to him 2 weeks ago but he's still not back to his normal eating patterns. I still have lots of this junk left in the pantry.",0
I'm pretty sure this killed my fish. The paint started bubbling and chipping off.,0
"I read every review and chose the nail clippers, but was disappointed. I have a 20 lb. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with very thick nails that twist and curl as they grow, which makes clipping them pretty tricky. I've been trimming my dog's nails since he was 14 weeks old, so Im familiar with do fife rent styles of clippers. I purchased the clipper for large dogs because in my experience, clippers for smaller pets don't work on his hard, thick nails. These clippers are cumbersome and the head is very thick, making it hard to see. If not for the guide I wouldn't have even tried them. I clipped my dog's nails shortly after his bath so that they would be less brittle. Even having taken this extra step I felt the nail trimmer required excessive grip and pressure, making it even harder to do an already difficult job.  While they did work,  the cuts weren't fast or smooth and nail clippings flew everywhere, confirming that lot of pressure was needed to cut his nails. They are well made and feel substantial in your hand, but I'm returning these because I won't risk using them again.",0
"This was probably my cat's least favorite toy I've bought for her, and that includes her distaste for those jingling plastic balls and mice made with rabbit fur. This thing is huge (bigger than a golf ball, smaller than a tennis ball) and was pretty dry on delivery. It's rough on the exterior, too and must not have had much of a catnip smell because she was absolutely not interested. I have some pouches of cheap fabric filled with a tiny bit of catnip that she's been rolling and drooling on for many years that she prefers way more than this thing. The Pawbreakers catnip ball is much better, in my opinion, as well as my cat's opinion.",0
I have a white dog and found that it started to yellow the hair on her muzzle. I did not see any improvement as far as tear staining.,0
"I bought the 2 inch one first then the 8 inch one. Happy coincidence that when you stuff the 2 inch inside the 8 inch, it has just enough resistance to make it a fun puzzle toy as your dog tries to get it out.",1
It is the best cat litter I have ever used and I will keep using this cat litter.,1
my sister loved this set,1
"Very good product, pigs love it! It is a much longer cut hay than some of the other bagged Timothy hay but the pigs really enjoy this brand.",1
I have a short haired yellow lab and long hair aussie/collie. I wanted to find a brush that worked on both types of hair. This comb didn't work well for either.....made it look like my dogs don't shed. Then i tried my fold furminator and lots of hair came off. So guess i will just stick with my fulminator and get a second one for long hair dog.,0
It came cracked,0
"Perfect rope toy, all the dogs love it. Can play tug and fetch...nice minty scent too.  Recommend as a classic toy to have around the house or yard.",1
"cheap looking, not worth it",0
"My vet gave me this as a sample for my senior kitty, who was having a lot of issues climbing things, being in pain, etc.  I mixed it into her wet food, no issues taking it. I saw the results within days, literally.  I am a convert.  And since it doesn't hurt other kitties if they take it, I don't have to watch and hover over the bowl to make sure no one else swipes a bite.",1
Had this for a month paid $40.00 it didn't keep the water cold. Not worth it!,0
My cat loves it!,1
Very cute,1
Perfect!,1
"I purchased this after the regular Stair and Odor Remover wasn't doing the job, and I'm so disappointed that I wasted my money. I attempted using this as directed on both a tile floor and a carpet repeatedly and I can report that it fails equally on both surfaces. I've left it on the surfaces anywhere from five minutes to an hour, and regardless of time I'm left with an overly fragrant area that smells like a combination of urine and perfume, which my puppy seems to thoroughly like to revisit. I was extremely surprised I had such poor results with the product based on the high reviews. Maybe I got a bad batch, but honestly I'd just recommend saving your money.",0
"I have ordered two of these now, and both stopped working after a month or so. They'd be great if they actually worked.",0
"When it states small, it should state Tiny",0
Love it for our aquarium,1
This collar is quality everywhere you look. Makes collars at Walmart look like a joke. We bought pink for our female dog and it looks really great on her. The reflect strip really jumps out at you in the dark. You can not go wrong with this collar. I would give it 6 stars if I could.,1
didn't fit my door way.  Returned,0
"Great idea, perfect for repurposing old bedding. High quality canvas. Dimensions as stated",1
Another piece of crap clipper that jams up even after lubricant is applied prior to use. Have to constantly stop and remove hair.,0
"It doesnt work, do not waste your money",0
Easy to use and gives me more control over my pet.,1
"I've had dogs all my life, but never had them literally crying for more, like they do for these treats.  They smell delicious and have nothing but good stuff in them.",1
Virtually no smell to the product and takes the pet smell away immediately!,1
"I paired this with a hammock-style back seat cover from Orvis that I already had.  This keeps my enthusiastic GSP in the back seat!  I love it, since I have a new car and want to keep it looking new.

I did have to modify its use by using front passenger ceiling handles and had to cut holes in the webbing to accommodate the hammock, that snaps around the head rests.",1
"I have a pit bull who cannot have anything nice. He has destroyed two beds already and any toy we give him (besides the kong extreme ball) looses all its stuffing within minutes. After hours of searching I decided to give this bed a try because it was way cheaper than most (huge plus if he was just going to tear it apart) and because it was more flat than others while still looking soft and comfortable. So far we have had this bed three times longer than any other one of his beds and he has not even tried to chew it. He LOVES laying down and resting his head on the raised edge. He loves it so much he brings all his toys (the indestructible ball, a rope, and the shells of his other stuffed toys) to his bed whenever he is done playing with them. It's thin enough I can actually stick the whole thing into the wash and I am just so happy he doesn't want to kill this bed I would give it ten stars if I could.",1
"Do not buy, created horrible rashes under my dogs armpits. Did not prevent pulling either, he just pulled harder. I basically paid a lot of money with this item to toture my dog. Not cool!",0
"I have an Aussie and this keep him busy! Great to take to the dog park, beach. All zips up in one convenient carrying case!",1
does not last need to be cleaned every three days or it will collapse.,0
"Love this feeder!  I've been looking for something affordable like this for a long time.  Note: It was taking forever for our cat to get through the training portion of the feeder instructions.  She was very hesitant to eat from inside the feeder, even with the flap up.  Instead, I just started inserting our cat into the feeder with the flap turned on and she grew used to the sound of the motorized flap.",1
i have 6 cats & they all love using this sunny window seat. i also put a thin blanket on it for them to lay on. i was skeptical about the winter months with the window glass being so cold that perhaps the suction cups wouldn't stick. its been on our window over 2 months now & it hasn't fallen off!!! Definitely recommend this product!!!,1
Great shipping from Seller. I have 2 himalayan cats. This is the best brush I have used. Cats like it too!,1
"This brush is great! My cats shed a lot, especially in the spring. This brush is gentle, yet it is easy to keep clean. I highly recommend this.",1
"My cat would not eat it, so I traded with my daughter's cat food, Purina One Salmon w/brown rice. My cat eats that.",0
"Cheaply made. It's very light weight so when it is empty the pressure from even slowly turning the water hose on would turn it over. If it did not turn it over it would twist the float valve sideways or upside rendering it useless. The valve and hose attachments are all cheap/soft plastics, so you can't tighten it up enough to hold it snug. And on top of all that every two or three days we had to disassemble the entire thing to clean the green slime out of it. Not sure if the more expensive stainless steel ones are any better. But I would not waste money on this one, at least not if you're planning to hook it to a water hose outside.",0
"These are cute and good quality. The squeaking drives me nuts, but it does note ""squeakair"" in the title, so I should have expected that.",1
Been using these for some time because our dog likes them.,1
"Great product for small dogs, made well.  My cat did not like it.  She has had to much freedom. She does better when I hold her so I decided to purchase an over the shoulder sling.",1
"I have a 65g corner tank. Wasn't sure this would be bright enough, but it actually puts out much more light than I expected. I'm very pleased. I put it on a timer to come on by itself....Tank looks beautiful at night!",1
"I got the system last week.
I follow the instructions but the remote doesn't communicate with the collar.
Send for repair locally hope they can solve the problem",0
Awesome! Dental chew that doesn't start out smelling like dog breath. Pup loves them too :),1
"Very disappointed . Much smaller than picture, quality poor. Sides do not stay up. Only order something like this if you can actually see it. It's not fuctional , plastic parts are beyond cheep.this is a 8 pound Yorkee :(",0
"Great zippers, pockets, and access and everything, this bag just needs to be a little bigger.  The next size up would be too big for my dog (mix min-pin).",1
My dog loves this treat!,1
This pill Denamarin is a large pill to try to give straight to your dog.  I crush it in a mortar and pestle then mix it with her morning food.  Her liver enzymes tested normal so I continue to crush and mix.  I hope this helps.,1
I wouldn't recommend this collar. It only worked for three months.,0
For $15.99 I could not believe when I opened it it was a little sample bag. I got a sample from Parina and it was bigger than this bag. I think this insult people's intelligence to send a Teeny tiny bag  of Cat food  out to anyone for $15.99. The last time I  paid $13 and a bag with huge what happened? Now I don't know how I could trust ordering things make my food anymore!,0
"I bought this directly from the local Petsmart about 2 months ago. The motor died on me today. Changing batteries didn't fix it.

I have all the same complaints as everyone else about the rpm being pathetic, the plastic guard being useless, etc. The only thing I liked about this product were the lights on it. I could dremel my dog's nails even in a dark room because the lights on the dremel perfectly illuminated the nail area. Now if only I could find a quality dremel product with lights on it. If only I could find a quality dremel in general.",0
Had this for several weeks now longest lasting toy with my bird he won't stop playing with it,1
It broke the first time I tried to put it on my dog.,0
"We tried this for over a month and it just didn't work for us.  I'm not even sure it was doing anything, but our dogs didn't respond.

The only thing I can think of is that our dogs are older and maybe they could not hear the high frequency output of this device.  I would be wary...

Also, beware that you only have 30 days to return it.",0
This basket is garbage. It came all bent. The material is very weak and flimsy and snall. I am very dissapointed.,0
"It is a little noisy, but our cats love it and it keeps them busy and happy a lot.  One of our cats hangs out near this thing and just waits for us to turn it on.",1
"This is a terrible product.  My cat's food will not slide into the bowl-- it just piles up underneath.  I contacted the company and they sent me (4 weeks later!) a ramp to tip the machine forward.  It still piles up under the feeder, and now my cats have developed a dangerous habit of using theirs paws to reach deep into the device to pull food down. I'm putting it in the trash as I couldn't possibly recommend to anyone that they use it.",0
"My review is really about the quality of the product shipped by Amazon, not the brand of food itself, which has been GREAT for my puppy. No tummy troubles on it, healthy and strong, growing beautifully. But I had a disappointing experience with the Amazon order.

I ordered the giant 26-lb bag, as my labrador puppy finishes a 12-lb bag in under 2 weeks. I was very dismayed to receive a bag of food - well over a month's supply for my 34-lb puppy, a more for a smaller dog! - that expires in two weeks. This is an excellent dog food, but I'm not going to feed expired product to my puppy. That's the danger of ordering food online, I suppose. While it's cheaper and certainly more convenient, I won't be ordering it again. (Amazon was great about the refund, however, excellent customer service.)",0
my dog loves it and it is durable!,1
Dogs love it,1
"my dog, a 55lb rotteeiler chow absolutely hated this. he found it intriguing for about 30 seconds before he realized it wasn't fun. the ball is extremely hard plastic that scuffs walls and isn't gum friendly. my dog is a calm dog, not hyperactive and not a puppy. it may just be his preference but if you also have a dog that is slow to play with toys, is excessively submissive or even a little dog, this isn't the right toy. i wouldnt leave this unsupervised if you have a dog hat chews a lot because it could severely cut their gums if they puncture the tough plastic. cute idea, poorly executed.",0
"This is the 4th purchase of this product I have made over the last 3 years. I usually by 2 and rotate but I'm glad I didn't this time. It appears the company has taken a step backward in quality. On the other 3 they were thick, plush, well made, and stand a lot of washing before degradation. This one is nearly the same visibly and is plush but I would say has about 30% less filler and is less robust. The price is about the same. Looks like I'll have to buy the more expensive products to get quality. The others lasted about 18 months. I doubt this will make 6.",0
my dogs love these...the only problem is they hide them from each other!!!,1
"The collar beeps and shocks at the same time. There is no warning that the pet can back away from before getting shocked. This isn't that big a deal when training the dog, but after the flags come down, there is no reminder without getting shocked.",0
Poor quality,0
Broke the 1st month and Amazon won't refund. The button to turn it on and off is really hard to push and broke off within a few weeks. Would NEVER recommend this product!,0
"My ferret instantly loved this thing when he opened it for Christmas lol  then I put it together for him and he liked it even more !  And has tiny tent poles and it's detail is just like a full size tent.  It has provided a lot of enjoyment for him and for my company that come over and see it.  For the price, anyone who has a small animal should get one of these,  it is well worth it !!",1
I used to always use the furminator but this works best on my corgi's thick coat. I'm always amazed at how much hair I remove.,1
"I have a 70lb Pit Bull and he loves to be in the outdoors.  I bought these specifically for the snow months in NJ.  My dog wore them until the thread started to come undone.  If I had to estimate, he probably got a good 8K miles out of these.  He wore them during the hot summer months too because the asphalt was so hot.  The sole is so tough and rugged it feels like a tire.  He wore them in the snow, mud, trails and even inside the house so he didn't slip all over place when we had company.  These work wonders.  Not to mention they look so cute on any dog.  We got the red pair because they didn't have the blue.  But, the one thing I do suggest is measure your dog's paw as close as you can to the measuring chart.  Also, add a little room if you dog has longer than normal nails.  Because you don't want his/her nails to be so long that it causes their toes to be pushed back.  This is what I considered when measuring.  We're now in Florida so we don't use it as much only during the summer when it's so hot on the ground.  I would definitely recommend these to all furbabies for their durability, texture, and long lasting.",1
"Bought this for general UV fluorescence testing, not for detecting pet pee.  It's a compact, bright source of true UV light that can easily reveal fluorescent brighteners in clothes and paper, even in normal room light.  Very satisfied with this UV LED flashlight!",1
"Works just great, thanks",1
"These capsules arrived packaged in a clear jewel case with a color copy of the dog and cat pictured folded and squeezed into the jewel case. There is no secure packaging for this medication and no information about the packaging included either. What medications are given like this? Looks like a shoddy home ec project from high school back in the day. I certainly wouldn't trust to give who knows what, and packaged under unknown conditions to my beloved animal. I ordered 2/28/12 and returned 3/13/12, and have yet to see a refund.",0
"Didn't do the trick for our rat terrier.  Didn't reduce the barking at all.  I bought it so that she would bark less during the night (she hears the slightest noise).  She has been barking MORE!  I checked the tightness, and it's appropriate.",0
"These cost a little less than some other liver treats on the market but beware.  The liver treats are not chopped into pieces so either you do that with your hands or with a blender/food processor.  Either way who wants to do that?  Plus a blender will chop them too small.  It's kind of like buying a car and thinking you saved money on it only to realize it's not painted and you've to spend the money and time to paint it yourself.

Plus, the smoked flavor must be something my dog doesn't agree with, because he has puked twice after eating these.",0
"Dose not work!!
Put battery in it checked it made sure it's working and it was. Put on the dog now I'm sitting here listening to him bark. If I tighten any more he'll chock.
Was also offered a full refund I never received ( if I remove this review) I was also offered a new collar for free which you guessed it I never recived.",0
"4 Ragdolls and they all love this cat food.  It's always on the pricey side, but my cat's love it.",1
Product arrived quickly. Cat would eat food with drops on top. Seemed to have a calming effect on my cat.,1
Great perfect,1
"Simply does not work well. The temperature settings appear to be great and it shuts off/on appropriately to the set temp. BUT the heater has almost no power, I'm not sure that its even working at all. The light goes on but doesn't change the tank temperature. I'm using it on a 45 gallon tank (advertised effectiveness to 100G) which has great circulation. If it gets cold in the room, temperature drops and does not recover until I put in a different smaller heater which corrects the temperature quickly. I may have gotten a bad heating unit, but as received, it doesn't heat.",0
"The item had a bizarre phrase on it not in the pictures, not in the description, and was peeling. Had I read the item reviews, I'd have seen they've done this to everyone else, as well. I honestly believe that the photos of this item were taken in such a way as to mislead customers. I felt like every time my daughters sounded out the phrase, it was going to incite some sort of Redrum or Bloody Mary scenario and some demonic presence would pop out of the sweatshirt into my living room. I strongly urge anyone considering this sweatshirt to save their time and money.",0
Did not work for my dogs...they still can eat the pads.,0
We changed to ceramic because of plastic concerns and this has been a no hassle product that the cats love. I like the look as well. Not very difficult to clean either.,1
"I used this for my 55 gallon fish tank. After reading the reviews of several filters, I realized that there isn't a filter out there that some1 hasn't reviewed as loud. I was quite happy when I received this filter because it was as quiet as can be. The secret is proper water level. The higher the water level, the more quiet it is. Unfortunately, after a month it just completely stopped working. Just in time for me to have missed the return/replace window.",0
Sweep my apartment half as often thanks to this thing,1
Arrived as total mush.  My dogs who eat anything don't even want them,0
"Our pup is a shih tzu -- about 6 pounds -- and the booster seat allows her to look out the window or take a nap. The clasp that attaches to her harness is a little stubborn and the way my car seats are built, she has to ride on the left hand side of the car behind me when I'm driving. Would have preferred to be able to see her over my right shoulder. However, we like the seat very much and would buy it again.",1
"Play pen was bought to give my small pets extra secure room to exercise. I have a guinea pig and a chinchilla. Both have definitely enjoyed it a lot (separately, of course). They like being able to see out of the large screen panels, and it's just the right amount of space for them. I am concerned about how long it will last before an escape hole is chewed into it by either or both. I can see evidence of chewing on the edges of the mesh after only using it a few times.

CON: Be aware that there is NO included carrying case, as the product information states. All there is for securing the play pen is an elastic strap that goes around it after it's folded flat. One of the main reasons I chose this one over other similar items was the (not included) carrying case. Not pleased by this.",1
"This IS THE BEST thing I have EVER bought site unseen!!!  My 9 year old Doberwoman is now VERY comfortable & has started playing more because of the GREAT rest she now gets on her dogbed.  THANKS for making her a happy camper, you know what they say....a happy Doberwoman makes a happy home!!  Seriously, GREAT PRODUCT.  BETTER THAN DESCRIBED.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!",1
"Wasn't very sharp and claws were chipping. Otherwise, the concept is good and does the job.",0
"I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it, and for the most part it hasn't disappointed.

The only reason this is getting four stars instead of five is the clasps that Clasp the top of the box to the bottom.

 As someone with limited mobility in my hands, the top was almost impossible to clasp with the clasps on the box, which made the first time I used the box a disaster as I didn't get them tight enough and litter went everywhere.

After purchasing some alligator clips and being sure that the top was going to stay on the box, I've been extremely happy with the product.

 It's much easier to use than using a scoop with my hands the way they are.

Omega work on an easier clasp system and you get a 5 from me.",1
Fits perfect,1
"I bought this for my corgi, but when we got a shelter dog that had difficulty staying in the back seat we used it on her.  It works well, but is very difficult to adjust while on our dog.  So, whenever it needs adjusting, I have to take it off of her and guess how much smaller/bigger it needs to get.  It comes with a seat belt buckle which is nice, but not mentioned in the item description.",1
"I like the size, texture, and shape of the burp cloth. It's better than expected because since using them, nothing has gotten on any of my clothes! Even after a wash, the burp cloths remained soft, colorful, and did not shrink.",1
These trimmers are lousy. They're so dull that they end up pinching my rabbit's toenails and causing pain. DO NOT PURCHASE.,0
So cute!  but could fit better- puppy can sort of wiggle it off if she tries hard.,1
"We adopted a bull/boxer from a shelter and were given this leash. It is far superior to others we have, it is very high quality.",1
I made a great deal out of this by buying three kits of sediment and carbon filters. Pre-packed resin is the way to go. If you've ever packed it you know it's a mess and you can't get it factory tightly packed.,1
"I live in a small home and cooking odors can be pervasive.  This product has really made a positive difference.  It absorbs the cooking odors without giving out any strong ""cover-up"" odor.  The label comes off easily, leaving an outdoor scene around the jar, or that can also be removed to have a completely white jar.  I've tried other similar products and this is the best I've found.",1
The refill bags are not standard sized. Would not recommend this item as you will constantly have to special order the refill bags.,0
"THIS IS AMAZING! I have two dogs and kids who promise to walk the dogs, but never do. I am busy and walking both dogs separately can be time consuming on busy nights. I've tried using two leashes and they constantly tangle with each other and the baby stroller.  This coupler is stretchy so it provides more room but doesn't get knotted our bunched up when the dogs get too close or try to criss cross one another. It's also nice that if they do cross over the others leash, they really can easily self adjust making my walks relaxing again! I highly recommend this product to anyone walking two dogs at once! Plus it's fun so my kids wanted to do it. That part may not last, but at least I know I can give them both the exercise they need! I just can't say enough good things about this!",1
Product does not stand on its own. SUPER thin and flimsy. Had to return. Caves in on dog. Dog slept on top of it instead of inside it.,0
I am not pleased. The lid does not fit and the acrylic bow in the front is flimsy- I can pop it back and forth. There's no frame or bottom stand on this. I paid over $30 for flimsy plastic.,0
Bought it cause our pup is named Bodhi Lil larger than expected but he will grow into it. Great brush.,1
Amazing Litter. You won't ever smell cat again in your apt.,1
"I followed the DVD included with the Litter Kwitter and started with the pan on the floor next to the toilet.  The first downside I noticed was when the cat used it he tended to try more for the edge of the litter.  Of course this means that it leaked between the disk and the holder.  Puppy pads helped with keeping the floor a little cleaner.  We cleaned it after each use and repositioned him every time we caught him going.  After about two weeks he quit going on the side of the disk so we moved it up to the toilet.  He started going on the side of the disk again and sometimes on the holder itself.  What a pain to clean.  We stuck with it for two and a half weeks before he had it and we switched to the orange disk.  He started going in the tub, in the sink, and on the floor.  We tried putting him on the Litter Qwitter and showing him where it was and that there was still litter but he just refused to use it with the orange disk.  After a week we went back to red and he again started peeing on the edge.  Another two weeks and we switched to orange again.  He switched back to the tub, sink, and floor.  We tried to get him to use it by having a stool next to the toilet for him to have some extra room to get up to the toilet, showed him the litter in the morning, before we went to work, and when we got home.  We picked him up out of the tub and sink when we caught him and put him on the toilet.  We moved his business from the tub and sink to the litter when we didn't and let him see it in the toilet.  He still wouldn't use the orange disk after another two weeks and we were so tired of cleaning up the mess that we just went back to a regular litter box.",0
sorry..its grey food???,0
My dog destroyed this in less than an hour. Why cant manufacturers make a product that resists at least a moderate amount of chewing?,0
Already broke.,0
Even attached to collar dog was out of this in seconds waste of money don't buy !!!,0
Product has been delivered twice now with a mid August expiration date and contents did not smell like sweet potatoes.  Look at your expiration dates!  I would buy again if they didn't send me old products,0
My dog loves these treats!!!,1
This is meant to extend the out take on the filter....which it doesn't. It's an improper shape to do the job. Useless.,0
"I've had one of these before, but this particular brand doesn't work as well as the one that I've had before.",0
"Amazon is a ripp-off co.i`ve been buying these from wamart for $7.00 for a box of 8 cakes,so when Amazon offered them to me for $5.25 a bought 5 for $26.25.they sent me 5 cakes instead of 5 boxes of 8 equaling 40 cakes.when i returned them they kept $18.08 of my money.if this isn`t a rip off nothing is.they make it so you can`t call them or send them an email.i`m trying to tell the world how dihonest they are and warn people against buying from them",0
Our cat loves this toy,1
really ill fit for the money,0
"Dog went blind and got sick after a week eating this product. So I'm not sure how to rate this product fairly. Im hoping this product was not the cause of his blindness.
  Don't know",0
This product is crap! It does not work at all. The product syncs to the remote and then if not used with in seconds it shuts off and you have to take the product off your dog and re-sync it and then the cycle continues. So you either constantly push the button or it turns off and will not work again until re-synced. I am completely disappointed in this product and will never buy anything from AGPtEK or this seller.,0
Didn't work for my cats UTI - Had to take her to vet and ending up spending $200 on top of the $40 I paid for this.,0
I don't like it because it doesn't filter anything at all.,0
"Cats hated it...would not get on this crinkly stuff for nothing, no treat or petting or coaxing whatsoever.  The only reason we kept these was the free toys that came with the order, now that thing was a big hit.  Received two of these toys with the feathers and bells and this is being enjoyed every day.  Curious....does the company keep the pads from being returned by including this really great ""free"" toy???",0
"I don't like to write negative reviews, but feel I have to this time. We have bought this product before and our dog loved it. We use it as as additive to her dry food for her evening meal so the price is fine. It really smelled so good that I was almost tempted to taste it. We had to buy another bag a while back. After a week or so our dog quit eating that meal. We had noticed there were no chunks of chicken in it. Maybe no chicken. And after I thought about it, no smell. Good or bad. As I said the price is fine if our dog will eat it, but not if she won't.",0
I am returning ASAP!! I work at a grooming shop and it worked great the first day but got very hot very fast!! On the second day after about a hour it would sound like it was changing speeds by its self!! For that price it should not do that! I'm ordering a different brand!,0
My cats love this!! Which makes me love it.,1
My dogs love this food,0
Way too small had to return,0
"Has the recipe changed again with the new label? This used to be one of my cats' favorite flavors and now my fussy cat won't touch it with a ten foot pole and my cat that eats anything is less than thrilled with it but at least she eats it. Please stop changing the formula! Some of us have incredibly picky cats and are running out of options. I don't want my cats on an all dry diet and Merrick is the ONLY canned food that my fussy cat will eat. He also no longer likes Beef Wellington and one of the chicken ones.

This didn't start with the change to Purrfect Bistro, it changed with your new labels.",0
"I bought two of these kits based on the Amazon feedback - kits were used by two different people on two different dogs. Both came back with insufficient amount of DNA for testing from the Labratory service - 'MARS/Wisdom Panel' (they didn't even tell me about the second one - leaving me waiting for over month, I only found out when I finally called them inquiring about it).

After multiple attempts with very little or no customer service, I have given up and am currently trying to get a refund on both - which is difficult to do because there is no product to return - the kits are sent into the lab with nothing to return to Amazon.

My advice - just have your vet test your dog. I feel this method is an easy scam.",0
My dachshund ripped this apart within 15 minutes and then accidentally swallowed some of it as he was chewing.,0
Had this on my cat for three days when I noticed his neck under his chin was wet so I  lifted his head to see better and the hair was all gone under the flea collar and his skin was raw,0
Good product but too Expensive.  Don't understand why the price increased from $60 to $80 between May and June.,0
"This was recommended by my dog groomer and it works pretty well. Better for my aussiedoodle than my terrier mix who has long, straight thick fur with an undercoat. It seems to pull too much on her and she prefers I use the Bass wood handle pin brush. This does work well to help detangle my always matted Aussiedoodle but it still is hard work getting her brushed out and she hates this brush. Runs when she sees it so I need to give her endless treats to keep her there while brushing.",1
Charlie loves these.  High priced treats for a little puppy for us.,1
"It is too pricey!  I really liked the look of it, but it wasn't very roomy and my cat did not like it.  My cat is a medium sized cat.  She started urinating on the floor because she disliked this box so much.",0
"I have two cats and would never be without the Litter Genie.  These refills couldn't be easier to use.  I hate running out of things I continuously use.  When I get to the end of one refill, I just go get another one off of the shelf.  And, by far, this is the best price.",1
"My 30lb 10 month old german shepard mix loved this but chewed this up enough to get pieces off of it within 5 minutes of giving it to her. Would give it a 0 rating if I could, waste of money!",0
Removes shedding fur like crazy!,1
"Does not work to our 2 year old Jack Russell terrier.  She won't respond to it, no matter what level of sound.  I wish I can return it.  I wasted my money on this item.  I bought it based on the rating and wonder how this works to other dogs and not with my JRT",0
Holes are way too small for any fish to get through,0
Exactly what I was looking for for my new tank.  Just the right size and fish.  Ive already gotten lots of compliments on it.,1
Was too big.  Return was no problem.  Decided just didn't need one right now,0
One of my golden's first baby toys. Only during the baby stage though. It won't hold up to a chewer past two mos..,1
"I like the design of this dog house, but I'm not impressed by the thin, flimsy building material used in its construction.  My dogs have not broken it (yet) but it doesn't feel like it would take much.  It is especially vulnerable during construction, before all of the wall panels are screwed together.  I was worried that, if a panel were to tip over before it was completely secured, that the damage would be irreversable.  I would not recommend this product.",0
BETTER than the name brand pads!!!,1
Great leash. Padded handle is nice.,1
"This stroller is wonderful.  My dog, who weighs around 12 pounds, fits in it with room to move around.  I am very pleased with the construction.  We have walked three times and have had the stroller 4 days.  He seems to enjoy it and it makes our walks faster and easier on both of us.",1
"I order it on line from the company's website. I requested only one to be send to me and I check marked the  one box. The price was  $19.99 plus shipping. I received an email that I was charge for one plus shipping and shipping for the second one. I email them the I want one, but no one even bother to check my request. So, they charged my credit card $35.89. Then later my credit card was charged $45.89. When I received the two one was not working at all and the second one after 2 days stopped working. I tried to call the company, but no luck. It's only good for one or two days and for the price is not worth it.",0
Most will have to train the dog to walk on it flat for a while. It is as sturdy as expected and seemed to be the longest and lightest.,1
The plastic buckle broke after 1 use as a harness for my 50 lb dog.  It was fine in the car where no real stress was put on the harness,0
Rats need to chew. They will chew on anything and everything in their environment and plastic is toxic to them. Also the bits they chew off can lodge in their digestive tract and cause death. I would not buy this cage and put any living small animal in it. This item was designed to appeal to people's sense of aesthetics and is not a practical or even a safe design at all.,0
"I was fortunate enough to adopt a shelter kitten whom I could harness train from a young age. We tried the Kitty Holster first, but the sound of the velcro ripping open terrified her. The Come With Me Kitty, on the other hand, is something she actively enjoys. She actually jumps up on the counter to be ""saddled up"" when I take it out. So ... great product, easy to put on and take off. That said, people unaccustomed to walking cats should understand that it isn't like walking a dog. You don't walk cats; they walk you. The harness and leash primarily are a means of restraining a cat in the event of sudden impulses and only secondarily a means of suggesting direction (most of which suggestions the cat will ignore). Some of our walks are far-ranging, others are spent in one place smelling a leaf. I bring a book with me.",1
I didn't come with instructions so I don't know what to do or how anything works on it everything came in the box but I don't know what to do without anything instructions,0
I use it for my english bulldog! overall a good  and stylish product and my kids love the purple color!,1
Haven't had any problems with it yet. About 4 months now.,1
"This seemed like such a great box but the urine seeps through  and I am always cleaning up urine, you can't find a liner that works and the liners I have been using I have to tape in place.  I am now looking again for a new litter box and I have had this one about 4 months.  I have to my dog peep pads to keep the urine off the floor.  I spend more time a week cleaning up the box and outside the box than I have will any other little box.",0
My pup loves the toy but chewed the legs off in 30 min,0
"I receive another product, I very angry, because I pay for it 22$ and I receive another product. don't buy this product",0
Works some what on our lab but does not even phase our bulldog. Looking for something else. Wish there was a way to increase the effect.,0
"I have the brand of tank and light specified for this cord. This product completely destroyed my tank light, it doesn't even work with batteries anymore. The specifications for this cord are an exact match for my light and it blew it out. Buy this and you risk having to replace your tank light.",0
"Disappointed with the fit and finish.  Welds not ground down prior to painting, air gaps between parts.  Dent in one piece clearly there prior to painting. Too many bolts shipped but not enough washers.  Vague instructions.",0
"cats like them so that is good, however, they are ""small"" pellets.
so as far as dental treats sometimes my 12lb Bengal cats just swallow them and skip the chewing part hehe

probably better for small cats if you are looking for  ""dental"" treats.",1
I tried this product and would have been better off adding just water. It did nothing to start the nitrites any earlier. Very disappointing.,0
My dog loves it,1
The tube I bought previously was a paste.  My cat loved the taste and actually enjoyed having her teeth brushed.  The tube I received with this order was more of a sticky gel and my cat hated it.  Even the smell bothered her.  I called Nylabone and they told me that the formulation had been changed and the old one was no longer available.  Guess I will need to find a different company that makes feline dental products and hope that my cats likes it.,0
I have several cats and the are having a great time with these. The hardest part is keeping them away from the dog.,1
Received as expected in quick order.,1
"Very cheap looking and tacky, like a tacky political campaign pin or something you'd win at a carnival! Didn't realize how large it was. Not worth the money, much less adding shipping to the cost! SAVE YOUR MONEY...",0
Didn't find it to help our German Sheppard with the constant itch she has from allergies.,0
"wow!  Super fast shipping!  Product is well designed, well made.  We ordered the 42 in for a growing puppy.  Our old 50 lb lab got in it.  She would be fine with the next size smaller as she had lots of extra room.  But we expect our puppy to be bigger than her.  This size is difficult to move around without two people.",1
"I have bought so many litter mat it is not funny anymore. I bought the Petfusion smartgrip and it was awful. It didn't stop the tracking, it was flimsy, and when the cats had an accident I was grateful because it gave me a reason to throw it away.

I have bought the Aspen Stay Fresh Cat Litter Mat with Scatter Control from Walmart and it works, but it is really hard to vacuum.

Finally I tried this one and I feel like I have found the final solution. I like this litter mat so much that I have three of them for the three litter boxes. It catches the litter, is easy to vacuum, and it is durable.",1
"Well built and effective cleaning of algae and grime from aquarium glass.
Very powerful magnet. The magnet is so powerful that the inside cleaning piece easily flips when switching across the glass sides.
When not attached to the outside piece, the inside cleaning piece is buoyant.
The handle (blue area) offers enough space to grasp firmly to allow movement across the glass.

I like it!",1
"Might be fine.  Seems like anytime attempt too much chemical filtration for our turtle, the tank goes crazy.  That's probably my lack of understanding.  So, rating low for use in a turtle tank when you don't know what you're doing",0
"No battery included FYI, though the other live pets we ordered had batteries included. The legs break off about every 15 minutes. I'm growing tired of looking for them at the bottom of the pool. Save your money and buy something else. These are junk.",0
"I have medium thick furred canines and a variety of feline fur coats.  I was not impressed with this grooming tool, did not like it, and do not use it.  I had hoped w/all the great reviews, it would work well for my animals, but it did not.",0
"Came quickly, looked like picture, extremely small!! Would even fit a cat or Chihuahua. I have a very small dog and they wouldn't fit him or my kitten!",0
"Even though the Huskies usually LOVE things made of duck, they do not love these.  One Husky will eat a treat some days if there is nothing else on offer.  The other will just walk away after giving me a disgusted look.",0
"I received the item quickly and it was packaged well and looks like the picture.  I was just hoping it was a little thicker, softer cushion.  My dog seems to like it better than his old one though.",1
Our dog loved these treats would highly recommend,1
"I was hoping for something better with these bowls. The rubber on the bottom doesn't stay on very well and the bone decal on the front rusts and it made the bowls look horrible. They didn't stay clean for me at all even though I washed them. I feel bad for serving my dog food and water in these bowls honestly. I ended up using my own bowls until I found a good set of his own. Found a really nice set of cute ceramic bowls at Home Goods for $10! He loves them and they're bigger than what these bowls are. I don't think Home Goods or Marshalls get enough credit for their pet section, look there first!",0
"I would never recommend this product. I put this on my dog twice (two months total) and he actually went balistic each time. It was like it was burning his skin or something. He was trying to bite his back. I felt so bad after I gave it to him. I went to the vet and asked her about it and he said to contact the company and tell them about it. Please remember that this is a pesticide that you put on your dog. Even a week later, he was trying to bite his back and couldn't relax or settle down. I would never recommend this to a doglover. One star is even too much. I was trying to return it but it's  it now apparently too late to return.",0
My two dogs can't get enough of these two balls.  Maybe because they smell like bacon but they fight over them.  I have both the large and medium size.  The large is about the size of a softball.,1
Works well. Love watching our fur baby while we're away at work.,1
"Works Great, cats love it to.  We recommend the placemat too.",1
Converted it to a skimmer pump. FYI propeller does not come apart. You'll have to cut the green propeller off to put a neddle wheel propeller on. Used a dremmel without problems. Pump otherwise is fine. Like the controller quite strong pump.,1
"This was delivered to me on Friday, August 3rd. I used it on Sunday, August 5th and it really did make walking my two dogs much easier, however after just one use we noticed that it had begun to tear and will no longer work. Neither of my dogs chew on leashes, so I'm left to assume the material used is just not very good, and that it's so poorly made that with very minor pulling (we use gentle leads as well so our dogs are unable to pull much) the leash is now unusable.",0
Great product however; I paid 10.00 extra to receive by Nov. 18th as we were going out of town and did not receive until Nov. 21,1
"I purchased a pair of these for my kids as stocking stuffers.  Upon receiving them, I was impressed with the build quality and attractive appearance.  The lights have withstood my kids' less-than-careful handling and are still working and looking good.  The UV light output is respectable, especially at the price.  We've used the light to illuminate glow-in-the-dark materials ranging from sticky stars to 80's retro neon clothing to invisible ink pens.  The lights were also used to bust a misbehaving Pug when Grandma visited recently.  Thus far, I have no complaints, and consider this product an excellent value.",1
My dogs shredded this toy within 15 mins,0
"I don't usually write reviews unless it's a product that went above and beyond my expectations.  Other brand ""durable"" toys don't last a day.  There is no such thing as an indestructible chew toy in my house, only one that will take a punishment better than the rest.  I've had the GoughNut for 3 months under everyday hard canine chewing and am just now seeing the red core.  Time for a warrenty replacement, and I will stay a loyal GoughNut customer.",1
"Complete waste of money, hasn't worked properly since I received it.",0
I thought I had ordered the chews.  what I got was a bottle of horse-pill sized foul smelling pills.  I love the chews that ome in a bag.  These not at all.,0
"This product ended up being very cheap. The suction cups weren't strong enough to hold our 10 pound cat. It constantly fell down, resulting in our cat getting hurt. I would recommend an alternative with a stronger adhesive.",0
Not sure why Wysong even makes this food. Way too much corn and other grains. Stick with their wet/raw foods.,0
Pups had a ball with this toy. Kept them entertained in the park.,1
My Goldendoodle's fur is too thick for this. Not powerful enough,0
"The product has a good smell, not very strong BUT it did not work as mentioned by pervious reviewers. I had to add it to the litter box many times a day and barely removed the smell. Baking powder / soda is still the best! #disappointed",0
My cat loves it! and so do I...I like the lift up flap as it makes it easier to scoop.,1
"I like that this collar fits well, and came very quickly. I also like that the phone number is visible from far away, so that if people can't catch my dog, they can still see it!  It's reflective and well made.  The clip does cover some of the writing,  for us,  it was just a bit of the name,  but my phone number is still visible.",1
"Bought bigger size & glad I did , my girl not so apprehensive with bigger door. Uses it all the time",1
"The cat toy I received looks nothing like the picture or description and is a different material so my cat wouldn't play with it. I cannot describe the material of the one I received but it's some weird soft ""teddy bear""-type feel instead of the ""shaggy"" rough-type one pictured. My cat loves the shaggy material so I always buy these type of toys. Petco ran out of them in-store and haven't restocked them so I thought I'd buy it on Amazon. My cat destroyed the first one and LOVED this exact toy. Wouldn't touch the one I received in the box so it's disappointing considering if it was at least the same material but a different color/mouse then I could have kept it. Returned it instead and now I'm on the hunt again for the one pictured.  :(",0
order was received on time and as advertised. these dog toys hold up the best against all other toys when you have a dog whose only mission is to destroy toys.,1
Very good. Upton date.,1
"Works great! i put together pretty easily and the size is perfect for my situation. (Puppy Toy Poodle)

The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my little 3 pound dog still managed a way to get out of this thing. Not sure how she did it. But if your buying this for a dog that is athletic i would suggest buying the mesh top for it as well.",1
Doesn't trap litter any better than a cheap one did. Litter is still scattered throughout the house. Save your money.,0
This shampoo smells really good and is concentrated so just a little bit of it applied to my poodle and labradoodle leaves them clean and fresh. I highly recommend the gallon size as you will save a lot more. Highly recommended!!!,1
Great,1
"Gave up and quit working after two months. Generic glass heaters last longer, don't bother with Tetra. Temperature is also unadjustable.",0
Opened this and all seven of my cats love it. From my two fourteen year olds to my 3 month kittens all love it.,1
Love It!!! It works great.  It really gets in the grass and it doesn't smear all over the place.,1
My two guinea pigs love running through this tunnel and popcorning about in it !,1
"We live in the desert southwest so there isn't a lot of grass to be had.  I bought three of these, followed the instructions and the pups love it!  Super easy!  They eat it all the time.",1
This collar not only doesn't work it doesn't even slow my Rat Terrier's down. I bought the collar as well as extra batteries and It's a total loss. Since I had to shorten the collar it's probably not returnable.,0
The product works extremely well.  Now if someone invents a method of spinning the hair into thread so my wife can knit house shoes we can make use of all the hair it picks up.,1
My black lab loves this. He gets the peanut butter out quick though and then usually leaves it alone. Love how you can wash it.,1
"My cat tore all the feathers out of this toy in the first 15 minutes.
Once the feathers were gone, she lost all interest in the toy, even with the catnip.
This is not her usual reaction to catnip, so I'm pretty confused and disappointed.
Not worth the cost, especially not with the exorbitant shipping costs.
Won't be repurchasing.",0
"These were great scissors the first time I cut my Standard Poodle's hair. They worked well the second time as well...Unfortunately by the middle of the third haircut, the blades stopped closing and they actually separated and could not be fixed.  Now our normal wash and cut is $60, so I'm still saving over $100 for the three cuts--but really? scissors that fall apart the third time I use them? And of course they are no longer under warranty--I don't give my girl a close cut more than about once every 2 months!",0
We absolutely love the Big Barker dog bed we bought for our English Mastiff  so that he could have it for his recovery after his knee surgery. I've slept with him on this at night and it is very comfy. I would definitely recommend this bed to everyone. We are very pleased with how quickly the bed came and how when you open the small box it expands to the full-size. Fantastic company and a great product!!,1
Easy to fold up and looks great.  Your puppy is kept safe and you are in control.  Great price also!!,1
My dog has always had bad breath. No matter what we try it comes back. These always seem to work. I give him one a night and he's good. He's only 7lbs so a big dog May need more. But they do the job. Just wish they weren't so expensive for a small amount.,1
"My dog loves this food. Its all very natural as Ive checked out all the ingredients. My dog was allergic to all chicken, turkey and beef so I had to find something different. She loves the chunks of vegetables and even will eat my regular vegetables now. This is a great price on this many cans you get, a lot better than in stores, if you can even find it. I prefer to refrigerate it and then microwave a little before giving it to my dog. Her coat, teeth and overall health have improved since about 8 months of eating this food. She's 12 and super healthy!",1
"I always purchase Lupine collars, for our dogs. They have a lifetime guarantee and you do NOT have to hold on to a ton of paperwork to take advantage of it.

One of our collars wore out, after several years, and all I had to do was call the company and return the worn collar to them, and they sent me a replacement VERY quickly.

Aside from the guarantee, these collars offer a HUGE variety of patterns, sizes and types. So there is a pattern and type to please almost everyone. Lupine also makes matching leashes and harnesses. So you can purchase a 'matching set' if you want to.

I HIGHLY recommend this product.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lupine-1-Inch-Tail-Feathers-12-20-Inch-Adjustable-Dog-Collar/dp/B007TRBVPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lupine 1-Inch Tail Feathers 12-20-Inch Adjustable Dog Collar</a>",1
"It's very comfortable and allows my puppy to walk and run without choking her when I correct her! When she was smaller it was a little too loose, but now is perfect and still it has room to expand on her chest.",1
Buying in bulk was very economical and also saved on shipping and handling.  We always use Tetra Pond Floating Pond Sticks.,1
Cute toy but unless you have very active guineas this will not do nothing but amuse them by its color. They don't chase it or play with it.,1
"Did not work, although I wanted a smaller sifter, this scooper does not sift through my cat litter at all, it might as well be a scooper.  Does not sift the wholes are tooooooo small.",0
"My dog loved it! She can tear up a tennis ball in seconds, but this thing lasted her days. Nothing ever lasted for days with her! When the piece got small, I just popped it in the microwave and it puffed up. She ate it all. Nothing wasted. I plan to buy another one soon.",1
"I have tried many crystal kitty litters and this is the best one I have ever found. I have four cats, the oldest are 15 and the youngest is 2 and this works well for all of them and lasts a long time.",1
This was a perfect headstone for our loved one. Reasonably priced and well crafted.  The company works with you to get what you want on the stone just right. Thank you for your patience with us as we were still in a state of mourning and changed our minds a few times as to what we wanted on the stone.,1
"I have a 6 pound Havanese and doesn't have any room. If my puppy moves his head just a bit the zipper opens, which is very frustrating.",0
"Works great, prefer smaller containers.",1
Best scoop ever!  No shaking means less spilling litter over the sides and it really does make the chore go more quickly.,1
The tool works very well on my long-haired cats. Two are prone to mats and this item removes them without having to cut out the mat.,1
"My dog is 72 pounds and although the vest wraps around his body nicely, the collar does not around his neck.  I've tried pushing it back, but then it's in anatomically uncomfortable position for him.  Nice color but disappointed the neck piece doesn't work properly as that's the whole reason I bought it, so help him become more comfortable in the water.",0
"I purchased this for a 5.5 gallon betta tank.  My water was about 68 degrees Fahrenheit, but this heater brought it up to the 78 - 80 range at just about full power.  Perfect!  I like the light indicating the heater is on, the adjustable power for more or less heat, and the fact that it's fully submersible.

I was worried it wouldn't be powerful enough to heat my tank to the desired temperature, but it did exactly what I needed it to.",1
just what i wanted,1
None of these calming or stress relief methods work.... at all. I have literally tried EVERYTHING!!! So frustrating. I hope it works well for everyone. My cat is impervious to all this gimmicky stuff. He isn't even phased by cat nip. (shrugs) More money spent to just be given away.,0
My pup and I love this ball. I wish I got a smaller size to stuff treats in every once in a while. But she loves to play tug and fetch with it.,1
My dog wiggles out in four seconds,0
My two pups love this!,1
Guinea pig loves it!,1
Product is not of quality as stated.,0
"The only reason i didn't rate this at 5 was because one of the bolts was missing and i wasn't able to use the third top plate... Other than that, this Cat Tree is incredible.. The cats love it.",1
Video rarely worked. We have strong wifi signal but the video app rarely worked.,0
"Our 7 year old Pup!! does so good on this food.  When trying to go to a less expensive dog food, without probiotics, the dog developed hot spots.",1
"Got this to retrain my dog who decided suddenly that 3:30am was a reasonable time to wake up and demand to be let out of his crate. (I eliminated and medical reason or bathroom needs that may have explained this.  Apparently its a common spurt of rebellion for dogs in their teenage stage.) The best way to deal with this is to let them cry or bark it out for a few nights (just like initial crate training) so they know acting up doesnt get them what they want. However I have shared walls with my neighbors and doubted they have the same ability to block him out as I do. So eventually it would get to a point where I would have to get up and let him out before he woke them up too. Which of course reinforced the behavior.

This device has worked up to a point. Hes very intelligent so he figured out exactly how loud he can be before it set off the device. So while hes not completely silent like he used to be, its at least toned him down to a point where I don't think my neighbors hear him, and thus I can ignore him without having anxiety over bothering anyone.

I do like the ability to activate it using the button on top and am also using it when I hear him trying to flip open the trash can lid in the kitchen. As soon as he hears the tone he comes back into the living room and lays down. My only complaint about the design is the lack of an on/ off switch.  You can only turn it off by removing the battery.",1
"This works very well. Just make sure you do the measurements on your dog so you get the correct size. I love mine. My boy no longer pulls when going for walks, it's made a huge difference.",1
"My cats have figured out that when they lie down on this bed, they will get their source of warmth! It is so cool. It really does turn on when they lie on it. You can even put a pillow on top of it to get it to start warming up and then remove it so the kitty can lie on it. If theres no weight on it, it won't power on so thats an awesome perk. Having that auto shut off feature for it when the cats aren't lying on it prolongs the life of it and also prevents a fire from happening. I wouldnt recommend using this outdoors. Its definitely and indoor item and should be kept away from weather elements. I plan to buy two more since I have 3 kitties!",1
My dog has been having this bone supplement since he was four month old. He loves it. It helps his bone growing.,1
Unfortunately the material did not stand up to normal wear and tear.,0
"It's an amazing ball for dogs, it bounces a lot and it's almost indestructible. My dog, a german shepherd loves playing with it, I had it for more than 1 year and it's in perfect shape.",1
"This doesn't spin or spurt as advertised, not at all like the pic on the box. The water stream is really weak, low to the ground and lack luster. Don't waste your money.",0
My picky dog loves it.,1
"This is hands down the best product that I have bought for our 110 gallon tank. We had a major cloud issue in the tank which we tried everything (water exchanges, chemicals, etc). I bought this as a last resort. I didn't expect it to work so I didn't take a ""before"" picture which I regret. I installed this product on a Saturday when you couldn't even see the plants in the back. The first picture is the tank on Monday (2 days later) and the second picture is on Wednesday (4 days later). It's hasn't even taken a week to clear up the tank. I can't recommend this product enough.",1
"I got the three gallon tank. The curved glass is beautiful. However, the light is so so cheap. And the cover that covers the back filter portion is so cheap it flies off. I also received a pump that was faulty. After one day of housing just one betta the water was cloudy. I will be investing in something a little better made! Such a bummer because the curved glass is very beautiful.",0
"This is a fantastic cat toy.  I purchased this version with the mouse attachment vs. feathers and it has been the best investment.  My two kittens NEVER tire of playing with it!  In addition, IT IS AN INTERACTIVE TOY PROVIDING THE PET OWNER AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH their feline children.  I receive endless hours of entertainment watching my two kittens stalk, chase, bat, jump and catch as well as satisfying their natural instincts.
Both soft plastic ends to the wand detach after some ""ferocious"" play but I remedied this with a little dab of super glue.
This toy received ""FOUR PAWS"" from Mozart and Chanel and that is good enough for me!",1
My dog seems to stay put.,1
My hamster loves the mix. It's hilarious cause he eats it in sections and separates the dried fruit and some of the seeds in a seperate corner to eat later.,1
"I measured my opening before ordering, from the center and across the bottom. Because I did measure I got the correct size.  Be sure you do the same.  Now to the attachments.  Make sure you have two holes in top bar across the opening of your doghouse before you order.  It's a pretty good fit, but not 100% There's mosquitoes where our dog lives, lots of them.  I still have a blanket covering the doorway as an additional barrier to keep them out.  I hope your dog door works out the same as mine did.  I gave it five stars.  Good luck!",1
We have two adult cats who like to go outdoors in the summertime and remain indoors during winter months.  As we live in a wooded area it is very important that they do not bring ticks and fleas into the house.  This type of protection can be very costly.  I found the product to be reasonable priced and effective and plan to reorder when needed,1
Durable. Sturdy. Easy to set up & to fold down. Easy to carry.,1
Not very durable. Dog (lab age 1) had it destroyed in minutes.,0
"Was supposed to get extra large dog.  Received large dog.  Box was partially opened and crushed.  Returning for a replacement,  will update review after",0
Could not change sides.  Sent it back.,0
this dog collar is huge for the small size it states it is...there are NO holes punched in the collar to adjust it as the dog grows! Definite buyer beware!!,0
Did nothing for my poodle. Returned it!,0
"This is a great toy and my cats loved it, but the feathers fell off on the first play.  They didn't even catch the toy - the feathers fell off on their own.  Very disappointing.  Great idea, but the quality is missing.",0
"This is our german shepherd's favorite toy. He loves to play fetch 24/7. We have bought this ball over 3 times, but within 10 minutes, he breaks the squeeker. He still loves it though and always has it in his mouth, but I wish the squeeker mechanism was more durable.",1
I give my lizard vitamins every few days since I got this stuff and he drinks his water better than usual!,1
"This harness is much smaller than advertised.  We used the size and weight recommendations listed on the website and our dog was right in the middle of the small size, but the harness just barely went around him.  We will be returning the harness and have replaced it with one that we found at Walmart for the same general price.",0
"These are gorgeous under blue aquarium lights.  They float with the water.
They are suction cup and I couldn't get one to stay on the side of the tank so had to place them on the floor.
Wish they would stay on the side but the suction cups just don't hold there.

They are very pretty in the tank especially under a blue light like the picture shows.",1
"Love Prime, been using it for years and this is a much cheaper way to get it than at the local pet store.

Not only does it get rid of chlorine/chloramine in the local tap water but it also helps neutralize ammonia, nitrites and nitrates!

I have a 55 gallon and a 180 gallon freshwater tanks with several different african cichlid species and a pelco.  At each water change i put in one capful in the first bucket of water and its good to go.  and Yes, it's supposed to be stinky, the smell immediately goes away once you add it to the water.

Highly recommended",1
My dog used this for a week and busted right out of the chest portion. Literally a clean break down the chest center. . . very thin and faulty material,0
my cat loves these things.,1
"Decent - occassionally find the remote and receiver loose connection, but overall works well",1
Out of 20 only 3 actually work properly the plastic inserts that make the noise aren't glued in and just pop out i am keeping 3 so cant really return but you cant just buy one and most likely would be just as bad and have to be returned at least i had enough to go thru to find a few that work .anyone want the rest lol !!,0
Good quality dog food. My dog loves it!,1
"Our cat would not touch these as packaged. I tried peeling off the individual papery wrappers*, and breaking it into smaller peices. Then she would taste them and spit them out.

*I wish the packaging had explained those wrapper thingies. They aren't paper or cellophane - not sure what they are. Are they supposed to be consumed by the cat, perhaps delivering some dental benefit? Or do they just keep the rather crumbly treats from disintegration during shipping? As I write this out, my question seems silly, I know. In practice, I did wonder, though in the end it did not matter because like I said, my cat didn't like these treats no matter how I presented them",0
"The ball is a little smaller then I expected, but I'm satisfied with the product.  Hope the kitty will like it.",1
"I purchased these a little over 6 years ago for my black chow Newfoundland mix. I usually have to buy a new pair every year because they only last for 2 hair cuts on him. I had barrowed a professional set from my mother-in-law that she used on her show chows. They didn't even cut it (pun intended) on my dog. These where within my price range for that years purchase so I got them. I never expected to be able to still use them 6 years later. I would shave him in the spring, summer, and occasionally in the fall if it was still really warm out. We also use them on my husband, son, and 4 brothers hair. As long as you keep them clean and well oiled they should last a long time.
The only down side is that the blades do get rather hot (hence the 4 star). Since there the only pair that seems to get the job done, over and over, I'm willing to over look that.",1
"These are a great option if you are looking for a multi vitamin for your dog. These are like soft little morsels that my dog loves to take. We feed quality food, but I like knowing she is getting a little something extra to assure her nutritional needs are met. We will continue using these and hopefully they'll pay off in the long run and help her age gently into her senior years.",1
"We absolutely love Tuffy toys. They are made to last for a while. the construction is usually high. The multiple stitchings definitely help our dogs in playing hours of tug. Although these toys felt nice to the human hands--soft fabrics, their playability quotient was extremely low. We had another tuffy snake prior to these two snakes. It was a different design. Rather than a curved design, it was straight back to front. The material used was the typical tuffy rough fabrick. Our dogs constantly played with it for several months before the stuffing was removed. This item, not so much. Within two weeks of purchasing these and opening them, our dogs managed to remove the stuffing. We have not had that happen with any of the other tuffy toys we have owned including the rings, bull, TRex, sea creatures, etc. I will not be purchasing any more of these snakes. It was $32 down the garbage bag.",0
Order arrived on time.  The product is great.  This was our second order of this product.,1
smells awful.  ironic since it's supposed to absorb bad smells.,0
This works but it is constantly getting stuck under my kitchen cabinets which can make the dog scratch the cabinet while trying to get it unstuck.,0
This bear is garbage.my mini dashund but it's foot off with in 30 seconds.save your money DON'T BUY THIS,0
"Has great suction and quickly vacuums the tank debris. However, as I suspected when I first inspected the water flow controller, it quickly split the tube in half after several uses. It has a weak spot there. The tube has 2 sets of grooves, for sliding a plastic keyhole tab over, to compress the tube. It split right on the groove. Poor quality construction.",0
"I have been using PowerSun MV bulbs on my Uromastyx and Bearded Dragons for 5+ years ... Never had a failure, most last at least 12 months, Zoo Med replaced any that burned out before 12 months (BUT YOU HAVE TO REGISTER THE BULB WITH THEM).  I will NEVER EVER use any other bulb.  Seriously, if you have reptiles, this is the ONLY Bulb you should be buying.",1
"Gave this one star because I had to send it back.  I can't give it a fair evaluation because it was too big for my 20 gal long tank.  I didn't notice when I ordered it, but when it arrived, it stated very clearly not to lay it horizontally or you could have big problems...so it went back.",0
"Great for my dog.
I bought that for purposes brushed face, I used a too large for any other purpose.
People will think I could use a comb.",1
The only cat food my cat can eat without throwing it back up.  Perfect!,1
"This tray is awesome. Tons better then buying the trays from the mfg of the litter box that cost a small fortune.
Another added plus is the extra capacity of the waste trap.
If you have a scoopfree box, do yourself a favor and buy the Forever Litter Tray!",1
Great product. Told me information I kinda guessed and info I didn't know but do now. So glad I got it.,1
Another entertaining toy...Keeps her busy.,1
runs really small.,0
"UPDATE: It is 3 years and 3 months since I bought this brush.  What a great design!  The wire bristles stay straight and the push button makes it easy to remove the hair.  My 3 short hair cats 'demand' I brush them with this brush.  They love it.  If I start brushing one cat and the other 2 cats hear it, they come running and beg to be brushed.  Regarding hair removal from the brush, push the button many times until the cat hair finally gives up and falls into the wastebasket.  The button is easy to push.
SUGGESTION TO THE MANUFACTURER:
Build a case that protects the bristles from getting bent when traveling.  My brushes have never travelled but I can see where this could be an issue.
UPDATE: One year later.  This brush is great!  The wire bristles stay straight due to its excellent self cleaning design.  I'm buying a third brush today.  Not because the other two are worn out but because I want these conveniently placed in multiple rooms of the house.
This brush is great!  If your cats like a wire brush like my 3 cats do, then buy this brush.  When I ask my cats if they want a brushin' then show them my brush they come running for it!  When you push the button on the back it will temporarily hide the bristles making it super easy to remove the hair without damaging the bristles. As a result the bristles stay perfectly straight.  I don't know if using this brush daily will reduce flea issues but my cats have no fleas.
Some reviewers complain their cats hate wire brushes.  In some cases I wonder if the owners are pressing too hard when they brush their cats.  The bonier the cat the lighter you should brush with this thing.  Seems like common sense but some people lack it.",1
"I'm torn on this review as it actually does make walking the dog much better. However, the material of the harness is so substandard that my dog has chewed through this twice. Ordered one and the dog chewed through it. Thinking maybe it was a fluke. I ordered another and the same thing happened. The straps just can't hold up to a pooch.",0
Really good quality!! Loved it,1
"This is one of the poorest quality items I have ever purchased on Amazon.  I have used cat cube housing for a long time for my outdoor cats.  They stand up well and are a place to sleep on our porch. However, we just found a new cat and I decided to order 2 Cube beds.  They came today and I immediately boxed them up for return.  First the cubes were squished into the box and flattened.  When I took them out they kept this form.  There is no way these beds will ever stand up enough for a cat to get inside. Second, they were just poor overall quality.  I would strongly caution against buying these.",0
These are the ones I buy all the time,1
"My youngest female German Shepherd has a beautiful coat but constantly was chewing and scratching.  I swear I would not have believed it but after 2 days of giving her as well as my older female shepherd one of these a day, the obsessive scratching and chewing has stopped!  I am giving them to all of my German Shepherds (3) and will post and update.  My older girl also has a cracked nose that can be painful to the touch....I am hoping these will help with them as well.",1
Excellent customer service. The product work great. I change my pads once a week and they are very dirty. My tank stays clear.,1
"But, it isn't great quality - I kept it because my cats jumped in it as soon as I took it out of the box - Hopefully it will hold up when I wash it and if so, I will certainly update my comments -

And it has a dog picture on the front which was not clear in the picture - Good thing my cats do not know the difference -",0
Too cute.,1
"My dog was getting diarreah and I had to switch to a very low fat diet. This is the only food it doesn't make him sick.
He loves the food of anything with chicken!",1
I believe this works good no more bites on me anyway.  the price is unbeatable as you can price compare but the convenience of Amazon is terrific.,1
"Rhe top comes.off, so I can't put the cat in. When sje sceatches the side, the tent collapsed",0
On my second box. Works great. And at a cheaper price than the store.,1
Made pretty cheaply and is really hard trying to figure it out to put it in your car.,0
total waste of money  tried it with many tanks and fish they all where cramped even the tetras the fry/egg slide trap is laughable and has to be removed to be used as any type isolation unit,0
This cat feeder was very disappointing.,0
"I bout this for my aquarium sump, it comes with a rubber seal, that you don't have to glue it anymore, it won't leak and currently working nicely on my 300 gallon tank, personally I think lifegard aquatics is absolutely reliable.",1
"We had one of these for our last dog, but it was too big for our new rescue, Mike, so I searched online to find one. We like it because it's not a chain that makes noise when Mike shakes at night (he sleeps in our bedroom), and it doesn't interfere as much as a chain when we're scratching his neck. We can leave his collar with all its jingly tags (4, including the Medical Alert tag) attached to his leash, ready when we take him out of the house, and still have a 'handle' in case we need it. The variety of colors is nice, and Amazon has a very good price compared to others.",1
"I heard this product was great and nearly indestructible. Within an hour, our puppy ripped the rubber lip right off!",0
"Instructions say no brushing necessary, but how else can it be applied? I find it easier to use those finger tip thingies instead of a toothbrush but when I put this on on of those things, it drips all over the place before I get into her mouth. Believe it or not, my cat is gentle enough for me to put it directly on my finger tip and use my finger tip to apply the gel. She hasn't bit me, yet.",1
"These are fantastic! We just had to change from dry food to canned for one of our 2 cats, but she rarely even eats a full small can at a sitting. These are great for keeping the leftovers nice and fresh.",1
"It helps get an unruly dog under control since you have their head collared and not the full weight of their body. It didn't work for us though, two broke on us. I have a 55lb Pit.",0
"My dog absolutely loved this toy. It was his favorite thing in the entire world...for about five minutes. Almost immediately the plastic becomes extremely sharp after minimal chewing and cuts the dogs face and eyes. My dog has permanent scars on his face from where this toy has deeply cut him. I obviously took it away once I realized it was cutting him, but he was so sad.",0
"My dog has a very sensitive stomach.  Gave her 1/2 of one snacker...she got sick.  Didn't work for us, but might for others.",0
"These were excellent and came at an excellent price. Mine didn't have any of the worm issues, but I would still make sure to check when you get them.",1
I have two kitties and they are both not interested in picking food/treats from this activity center even though they both have different personalities and one of them just obsessed with food.,0
Awesome,1
tiny and not long enough for a Senegal size parrot cage.,0
Perfect size and dogs can't get it open.,1
This is such a waste of money. Its cheaply made and won't secure to my birds cage for her to go in the house or climb the ladder.,0
My fish LOVE these flakes. My betta has started refusing his pellets (also New Life Spectrum) to eat these. Which I figure with such good quality will be fine. my ONLY complaint is how large the flakes are...BUT I imagine for larger fish this size is perfect. but for my guppies and tetras they are a bit big but I just crumple them up a bit. Also the container is HUGE!! Way more than i expected. So its expensive but will last my small tanks probably a year if not more!,1
Our Cocker Spaniel is under the weight specified for the stroller but cannot comfortably ride in it because it is built for a very small dog.  Very disappointed in product!,0
Very small.,0
"At first I thought this was going to be a perfect fit for the tank we have.  It was much quieter than the model I was replacing.  It worked perfectly till I noticed one day the water wasn't filter through anymore. The power had been knocked because of a storm so I didn't think too much of it at first.  I went to get a little more water to add to it to get it started like I had with my previous filter.  However it wouldn't flow anymore.  I tried a few times and nothing.  I finally had to unplug it, now my tank is a mess because I refuse to have to pay to replace it.",0
I chose the small one.  very cute.  kind of havy and hard to put togeher,1
"My dog got so sick off of this.  After two trips to the vet for bloody diarrhea and $600 later,  I stopped giving him this and he finally got better. This was the only thing that had changed in his diet and I'm glad to say after a week+ of him pooping blood, he is finally back to normal and on different food.",0
"I purchased this product a month ago, I used it approx. 2 weeks with no issues. Second week in the machine started to make this loud whining sound and not product humidity. I have contact customer support but they have failed to respond. Please beware!!!",0
"These toys take a little while for my dog to destroy. Love the no stuffing and he loves the type of bottle squeaker that is in them. He is a 110lb Sharpei/lab mix, and I do supervise him and actively play with him while he has this toy out. But if your dog is not seeking out pieces to gnaw off and is enthralled with repeatedly squeaking a toy like mine is, then these cute zippy paws toys are perfect :)",1
Fits well. No choking when I pull her back.,1
"Used these for treats, and my corgi enjoyed it. If your pet is a chewer though, try to supervise since my dog destroyed the one I bought.",1
This collar burned my dogs neck and left two wounds. I gave him a break today to realize he had two open wounds on his neck.  It worked for my other dog but now I'm extremely worried for the safety of my dogs. Ready to get sued? It should be illegal for you to sell this product when it physically harms and makes a dog bleed.,0
My dog (a terrier) chews on this alright but I noticed blood on his mouth and inspected this product. It's hard plastic and forms very sharp edges and pieces and can cut your dogs mouth. Don't buy please.,0
Have a white pit mix. She doesn't like it.,0
"I have had one of these before and it worked great.
But...
this one hardly makes my cat movie.
I would not buy this again or  recommend  It to a friend.",0
The lid never fit right and it was hard to unlock once I got it on.  It broke within weeks and was too much trouble to return.,0
Zero coral coloration/ major growth noticed after 3 months,0
The Honiss part where is not stiff did not look like there was an invisible dog in the harness that was disappointing,0
"Works great, doesn't seem to bother the dog at all, easy to apply.",1
doesn't work.,0
"I learned about Fizzion on TV's ""My Cat From Hell"". This stuff is fantastic! It cleans wonderfully with no odors left behind. I wish I had known about this before instead of spending money on other products that simply didn't work.",1
"Maybe it's me, but I can't seem to get these to work.  They look great and absorbent.  I put one on my old beagle, went to bed, and the next morning it was laying next to his head.  :-)  He wriggles out of them.  I emailed the company, and they never got back to me, unless their reply ended up in my spam bin.  (I always read email on my phone and don't have a spam box enabled.)  With that said, everyone else seems to like them.  So either I put them on incorrectly or my Houdini dog just won't keep them on!",0
"I got a Drinkwell fountain on a lightening deal (after my Pioneer pet fountain pump quit and it's replacement cost as much as this new one) and ordered a plethora of replacement filters.  The instructions say these need to be replaced every two weeks...  i say they need it every week.  They do not keep the water in the fountain fresh at all.  I have to change it every 5-7 days as it gets murky and slimy.  I put filtered water in to begin with!!!  Am trying to make the filters last the two weeks, so i wash them out with every water replacement.  This NEVER happened with my Pioneer Pet Fountain.  Am very disappointed.",0
My green cheek conure liked this food but it dyed his cheeks red.  Try Zupreem natural - same good food without the dyes.,0
"I was excited at first at how well this product worked.  My cats were scratching up the doors and door frames in my house and they stopped after I applied Sticky Paws. They go to scratch the wood and get discouraged when their paws stick to the surface (kind of amusing to watch, actually.) However my cat's fur started sticking to the strips of tape (black fur, mind you so it looked terrible) and then they went back to scratching the wood through the now non-sticky, useless tape.  I just got through an hour of scrubbing and scraping using ""Goo Gone"" and a palette knife to remove the product from just one door and door frame which inspired me to write this review.

I don't know what the solution is to this problem -- leave out more scratching posts(?), leave doors open(?), tack up a sheet of vinyl that can be easily removed and replaced as it get worn down(?) -- but what I do know, is you should steer clear of this product.",0
I always use some supplements for my dog's joints. It is another one. I hope it will helpful for him. Very inconvenient spray system. I use my old dropper bottle instead of original bottle.,1
My 3 dogs go crazy for these.,1
Best dog food ever!!,1
Worked during winter and then we had a week of warmer weather.  Then It got cold out again and I plugged it back in and it didn't work.  Wo worked for 4 1/2 months then stopped working.  Is there a way to reset these things like the thermostat is stuck?  Not sure how it mechanically works and it doesn't look serviceable.,0
"I buy this for my Diabetic dog. I wish they had it with just beef. I have another dog who can't eat chicken and I have to give her something else. I'm not sure they would call it yummy, but it's usually not refused.",1
"This is a great pet bed for the price.  It's softer and of better quality than most I've seen that are twice the price or more.  Our dog avoided it the first day (she's picky)  but after that she has slept in it every night.  Great bargain, great quality.",1
2nd time I order and it always comes broken.,0
Don't know if they were old supply but all slices were stuck together and hard to mold around the pills. Won't buy again.,0
"Sizing is off. We figured what was appropriate by our measurements and weight, but the size that arrived was way too big. It's also clunky and does not appear comfortable, compared to other types of vest harnesses. They accept returns, but postage is on the buyer, not the seller.",0
"We gave it to our 1year old 69 pound Lab, and in under 30 minutes, he had holes in it, and ripped pieces off.  It looked like an old toy within minutes.  We allowed him to play for 25 minutes, then took it away.
Unfortunately, we will have to send this back.  I like the Kong products normally, this particular one just didn't stand up.",0
My fishes don't see to care much about this specific flavor.,0
Our dog seems to be a tick magnet. This thing gets them off easily and without any hassle. Even the dog doesn't mind it.,1
Great product. Fast shipping and was the product I needed. Great seller.,1
"My lab is 10 years old and two years ago went through hip replacement. She recovered with ease and came back about 60% , she just didn't have the spunk she once had. I started her on the Glucosamine just t0 see if it would help her. Now after  to the hip surgery she no longer could jump up on the bed to sleep with us. After two weeks on the supplement  this girl had bounce in her step. She is a real picky eater and wolfs down her food with the supplelement mixed right in  ( I dose her twice a day.) It has not affected her stool at all, which I thought for sure would be a problem... And Yes!!
she jumps up on the bed!!",1
i have several small and medium size puppies and i found the larger pads really works better for them i will continue using them,1
My dog loves these and I had them on subscribe and save but this last one had mold all growing in it within a week or so of opening it and we live in a dry climate (San Diego). Had to throw it all out and worried I fed mold to my dog,0
"My overweight Mini Pin has lost all the extra fat she put on after we first adopted her. She looks very sleek and glossy, and eats this food with no tummy problems. i recommend for any overweight dog or older dog.",1
Snaller than expected but good quality overall. Little top heavy. Works best against a wall or corner.,1
Crate was rather flimsy and all the parts didn't go together.  The front piece falls off as magnets don't work.  The dog figured out how to get out on first day. Needed to add other equipment to secure the door.,0
Great product. Very bright. Worked on all surfaces.,1
"I never write reviews, but this product is amazing! We have a 12 year old German Shepard and she had the worst odor. I was embarrassed to have visitors over and had to cage her when people came over b/c she smelled so bad! Grooming her every 8 weeks didn't work. So, I searched on the internet and this product came up, I bought it, and I kid you not, within 2-3 days, her stool was normal and her odor was going away.  Within 5-7 days, she had no odor. We have been using it every morning in her food for about a month now and it really works. I just ordered more. Thank you to whoever developed this product! The ingredients are simple and I would recommend to anyone.",1
"This arrived only about 3 days after ordering.  I was a little intimidated before putting it together, but I was able to manage it in under 45 minutes.  The finished product is so cute and I cant believe Ive been living with cats and without this litter box for so long.  It looks great in my kitchen.  I have a 11lb kitty that fits fine inside and a 3 month old kitten who is able to access it just fine as well.  I 100% percent recommend this product!!",1
"Did not clear tank water, and actually made it cloudier.  Only after repeated use of Stresszyme and water changes did the tank become crystal clear.",0
This toy may be tougher than store bought but if my 8 pound shitzhu  can damage the threading in a couple days then it's obviously not the best. I thought tuffy's were supposed to be good.. Not! At least it was only 12 bucks,0
"Good quality, nice materials, and made in the USA! Score!",1
"I have 6 rescue dogs but only two are yorkies.....they LOVE IT, and my other dogs love this too!  So from one pawrent to another, this is a great tasting dog dry food for all of your babies!!!!",1
Not sure why but they just will not eat these.  The next size up is softer and they ate those no problem that I purchased at a local pet store.  These were quite hard and had not smell?,0
My dog has the dogbone treat and loves it. It was falling apart so I got a new one. She chewed it for less than an hour and it is already falling apart. I am very disappointed in the quality of this. She has been chewing on her old toy for a very long time so im surprised that this one got destroyed so quickly.,0
My cats (and daughter) love this thing!,1
"my cat can hear this, but can care less. This doesnt work as a training mechanism.",0
My cats' favorite treats! And when I bought this the price was cheaper than in stores.,1
smells bad,0
There's no proper instructions on how to work it once it turns into one string,0
Does not fit what it says will fit for cat food,0
I was very disappointed with the last pair pup wore them once and the little velcro square came off of 2 of the 4 boots,0

"Changed our lives! I kid you not. e.g. the other day all five of my dogs (yes five) were barking outside. I went out there and they were barking at neighbor brushing leaves. I went up to them and said NO! and gave a little squirt of the Convincer and instant silence. My neighbor looked at me in amazement and said ""It's like magic."" And it is.

Just have to pick it up off the coffee table for them to be quiet.",1
They sent a much smaller cage then the picture showed. And its a very flimsy cage. It's not built for a parrot. It's more for a Finch or parakeet. Very disappointed.,0
"Two of my three cats won't use the things.  While I understand that this is a issue based upon what the individual cat is comfortable with doing, the overall design of the door is flawed.  While one of the two cats that would not use the door, was trying the door out and pushing it with his paw to get comfortable with it, the door closed on his paw catching it like a trap.  As he tried to pull away, the door simply became tighter and clamped down.  He then of course flipped out and ""screamed"" (never have I heard a cat make that sound before) panicking until I was able to get to him and push the door the opposite way to free him.  Luckily I was close at hand so he didn't suffer an injury.  I have already ripped the flaps off the doors to prevent this from happening in the future, so basically I have wasted my money.  I would NOT buy this product again.",0
Cute bow tie. Our dog looks so cute,1
We have an abuse case in our kennels and he seemed to really be noticably calm / less stressed taking these.,1
RECEIVED WITH L SHAPED RIP IN BAG.  REPLACEMENT CAME AND IT TOO HAD HOLE IN BAG. UNSURE OF FRESHNESS OF FOOD.,0
"The cage is stable, but it ended up not being that great for my rats. They would just get freaked and be able to grab all sides on the top when i had to take them to the vet, also a bit cramped for my 2 rats to be comfortable going to the vet together.

Much easier to just buy one that is a little larger with a side door.",0
My dogs love it. Damn near ripped my pants off when they seen me get the bag.,1
"Tried it out a few days before vacation just to make sure it worked.  The food did not refill without shaking the feeder.
I'll try another brand of food next time.",0
"Very disappointed in this item.  I bought the large for my Doberman.  After just a few weeks, the legs folded under and the inexpensive screws broke off.  I was so excited with this because he loved it.",0
Got the wrong cat food. The cat picture looked the same but it was different.,0
Good,1
The top is ok makes nice cave. The bottom needs more filler and has like a button on bottom. It's very flat in the middle and the button like thing in middle irritating for kitty. I would have to cut and put more filler in bottom and kitties probably still wouldn't like it. Don't know if this is a defect on mine or all are made this way.,0
I believe this should be marketed as 40 pound container. I have about 10 pounds of dog food left in the bag. At least it was cheap.,0
"There were a lot of bad reviews on this and people saying it was crap quality and falls apart. I have had it for a couple months now and other than one cat being knocked off by another, not a single issue! It seems as i it's designed to replace in a corner, which is exactly where I put it. The upper platforms were little wobbly so all you have to do is screw it and mounted into the wall and you won't ever have to worry about it falling over or having too much weight placed on it. Have 3 cats, 7 lbs, 13 lbs and 18 lbs. Not an issue at all with them and this tower.
Most of all, your paying almost a third of the price of high quality cat towers. You get what you pay for a, but with this you get a lot more than you pay for. You just have to be willing to do a little bit of extra work to put it together right.",1
"This is not a ""dog whistle"" it's just a whistle.",0
"I'm 6' 3"" with knee and back issues, so this is really good for me.  The handle is long enough that I don't have to bend over very far to pick up messes.  The only issue I have with the product is that the bags they include are only really good for single use cases.  I find it more efficient to use it with grocery bags every 2 to 3 days.  I use it indoors for accidents too, and it seems carpet safe!",1
3 dogs of various mid/large breeds.  Not one of them showed any sign of reaction.,0
Great price!,1
"The dog loves these; the cat begs for these ... best of all, made in USA and benefits our veterans.  Used to get locally but now unavailable.  So grateful Amazon picked these up.",1
"My Wirehaired Pointing Griffon had it in pieces in minutes, disappointed!",0
"I bought this for my Staffy and he is 5 mons old right now. He fits in it well, it seems that he will fit in when he is full grown too. Its a nice cage for the price. Everywhere else i looked in pet stores it was way more expensive.",1
My baby boy is in the hospital with liver toxicity from this product!  Clove oil is toxic to cats!,0
I've order e these before but these treats came with powdered substance flaking off of them :/ they don't look appetizing,0
My cats didn't seem to care for it.,0
Didn't last 5 minutes with my lab.,0
A great fetching ball.,1
"Really cute and my puppy absolutely loved the toy ... for the 15 mins I let him have it. However, it didn't take long for his puppy teeth to wear through in several spots so I had to take it away.",0
"My dog busted out of this kennel EVERY time I put her in it, even when I zip-tied the doors shut. It also arrived dented and bent. The frame is wobbly and cheap and the bars are so thin I can bend them with two fingers. Yet somehow it's still very heavy and awkward. Ended up re-selling to someone else at a huge loss just so I wouldn't have the hassle of shipping back.",0
"I got empty box first shipping
And called then they sent new again
But both are too old
Expired 08/21/13
But my lab works well with ear relief wash&dry
But they sale expired one
That is big problem",0
"it works well, but its already starting to fall apart.  and emptying the hair is nearly impossible..it doesnt come out.  so overrall i would say not worth the money",0
"This product is a big let down my chinchilla loves dandelion treats and Timothy hay with Marigolds in it which I usually buy from Kaytee here on Amazon. Here is what I liked, the hay is cut in 3 to 4 inch strips that was the only plus. The negatives far out numbered the plus's, I bought 3 of these tubes assuming the tubes were stuffed with hay and marigolds which is not the case they are placed in the tubes like a box of cereal as soon as you open the clear wrap around the tubes it all falls right out so there is no foraging for any critter, there was only 1 marigold head in the entire tube not even any petals. All 3 had holes in the plastic wrap because of the way they were wrapped at the factory so the box they came in was full of chaff and on the verge over being way to dry because of the air and it not being packed tight in the tube like the bags are packed the air can easily dry the hay way too fast and in each tube there was plenty of chaff dust way too much. Out of curiosity I opened the other 2 tubes  and found only 4 more marigold heads and also no petals. Each tube filled a one gallon zip lock bag which will at least slow down the drying of the hay. The only reason I kept them was for the tubes that they came in you can't buy a nice tube of this size for a chinchilla to play in for the ""add on"" price of $2.35. If you are buying this for the marigolds as I was you too will be very disappointed like me.  Just buy the Kaytee Timothy hay with Marigolds for a few dollars more if you want marigolds with your hay unless you want the tubes which are big enough for a chinchilla to play with.",0
Dont think its working,0
"I have spent over a thousand dollars on my dogs ears and I have to admit once it was brought under control by the last antibiotic treatment I started to use it and it works! It's almost gone and I will be buying more. I want to try the shampoo but its not available right now. Below is my dog, he has socks tapped on both legs from acessive licking. He takes Amaquel daily. If he has a bad allergic reaction he takes 2 Amaquel and Benedryl every 4 hours.",1
"Im not sure if my dispenser was broken or something, but the lid NEVER stays on. In order for it to stay screwed shut I had to tape together the two parts. I also wish it was a bit larger in size, as it fits snugly with other replacement bags.",0
The price was nice however they have a rather unpleasant odor.,0
"I want to like this, so much, but like other Spot Farms products they get hard and stale 1-2 days after opening. My dog loves them but she vomits after eating them once they're so hard to digest.",0
"Our Westie has sensitive skin and allergies, this food has been the best for years.  Great deal on Amazon with subscribe and save, and it's delivered to our door!",1
Good product. Cats love it,1
"OK, so my cat really loves this, and it is helping to save our furniture.  However, why oh why couldn't they have put sisal or something sturdier in the center of it instead of cardboard.  Oh....wait, I know why - because they wanted to make more money selling refills...got it.  Never mind.",0
Dog really loves this treat.,1
"Although the construction of the item is great, I have changed its purpose from a cat litter box to a cat bed and house.  The height of the item is too short for most cats to use comfortably unless you keep the lid open so they can stretch their head out, which defeats the whole purpose.  My cats were laying and hiding in the litter instead of using it.",0
"I ordered these remote dog correction collars. the package was great and the items looked great. I charged them over night and tested them.
one BIG problem, one of the collars worked great. but the other was not working. I charged it again over night to see if it would work. but it still did not work. PLEASE SEND another set. I paid for two working collars. but only one works.",0
"We had been buying regular Timothy hay. I didn't realize how much she disliked the hay I had been buying until I saw her munch on this! Not sure if its the cut of the hay or if its fresher than store bought. Ive never seen wafer cut hay at the store, so Ill co tiniest to purchase this!",1
My dog Ricardo loves his new house.,1
"These are an absolute godsend! I have two pups under the age of  1yr that can tend to get very wiley. Being able to train them individually with one device was really great. The handset allows you to easily switch between collar number one and two quickly and easily. You can also switch between shock, vibration, and a beep very fast. I found personally that neither dog ever needed anything more than the vibration collars. The vibration instantly interrupted their train of thought when they were misbehaving. One of my dogs was a rescue and nervous after having been abused so I was definitely concerned and did not want to use a shock collar on her and wondered if a vibration collar would work. She had aggressive barking tendencies towards men, and would go into what many people call a red state of being out of control. The vibration was enough to break her of those bad habits. Yet it was gentle enough that it never frightened her. Keeping the vibration at a medium level of 50 and moving it up 10 to 15 points at a time to a maximum of 100 if she was continuing in an aggressive behavior quickly stopped her actions. Even now if they begin to forget their manners putting their collars on with simply the small weight of the electronic feature and them seeing me bring out the remote, just like small children, their manners seem to immediately get better LOL",1
"In order to use this the treats have to be extremely small. I tried using normal dog food like the photo shows (or what I interpreted it as being) and the food got jammed and I had to keep helping my dog. The other frustration is that the food can move backwards in the ball which may be nice if you're trying to really keep your dog occupied, but I felt like she was never getting rewarded for her efforts. Finally, if your dog is a strong chewer, this ball is small enough to fit in their mouth and pretty easy to destroy.",0
This chew was disappointing .He chewed it down to nothing in about an hour. NOT for active aggressive chewers. He seemed to like it while it lasted though so it gets another star.,0
"Beautiful and soft, My dog loves it!",1
"Frustrating for our dogs, so we gave it away",0
"All my 5-year old wanted for Christmas was a pink fish. I found the perfect pink and red betta, and Santa supplied her with everything he would need, including this tank. She named her fish Frank and was the perfect mom, never letting food stay in the tank, using test strips to check his water conditions......not that we needed to do that much considering he only lived 10 happy days, making bubble nests, before the tank killed him. A few people mentioned that their fish got ""sucked up by the filter"". That's not quite what happens though. The filter intake is covered and could not suck a fish up, so I didn't understand the reviews at first. However....

Take a look at the ""Product Description"" and note the photo of the tank with filter installed and the hood off. See that open area on top of the filter, where the white filter pad lies? That surface sits about 1/2 inch above the water surface....maybe less. Note: fish jump occasionally. It takes next to nothing for a fish to lift a bit out of the water in this tank and end up stranded up on the filter pad with no water. That's what happened to our Frank when we were out one day. To add insult to injury, he obviously tried to flop back towards the water, but instead kept hitting the light bulb of the hood which is exposed right over the filter pad and is very hot. The smell was not good. And the situation of that bulb makes it impossible to block a fish from jumping up there with mesh or sponge. Anything wedged in there would probably burn on the light.

The only reason I gave this two stars, instead of hating it completely, is that one COULD choose to use the tank without the filter in order to avoid death by suffocation and cooking. Just keep your eye on the water quality.",0
Great price! Our chickens love these as treats all year.,1
BECAUSE OF THIS COLOR MY 1 1/2 YR OLD CHIHUAHUA STARTED HAVING SEIZURES AND HAD TO BE PUT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE POISONING OF THE COLLAR.  COMPANY AGREED TO PAY PARTIAL AMOUNT OF VET BILLS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SUFFERING THAT MY DOG INCURRED.  THE CHEMICALS IN THIS COLLAR GETS INTO THE DOGS BLOOD STREAM AND CAUSES FATAL RESULTS.,0
Cats seem to like it quite well.,1
Works great!  Bought this for when we go camping.  Seems comfortable for our dog and the light doesn't bother her at all.  Great price and great product.,1
"I found this box of millet to be extremely dry and brittle.  I suspect it is old and has been drying out for a while.  I have bought lots of millet and by comparison this is not of good quality, seeds drop off spontaneously making a huge mess before they can ever make it to my birds. Extrememly brittle stems indicative of old stock. Will have to look for different source.",0
"I had the same experience as the other 1 star here. My dog is a beagle, 34 Lbs...he tore up the nose within 15 mins as well and was pulling the stuffing out so I took it away from him. I also bought the bunny and it seems to be doing fine, it's been three days and still alive.",0
"This is an awesome product, really keeps my cat under control.",1
"My husband and I  figured out the radius,  put in the flags,  took the dog around the boundaries and let him go outside the boundaries where the color would beep,  then gently call him back.  After a while, we let him go a little further where he received a poke.  Then we called him back in the boundary told him to stay in the yard.  He has not been outside the boundaries since.  Works great.",1

"I love the fact that AvoDerm Natural doesn't contain grains.  In the short time Emily has been enjoying it, she has stopped itching and scratching almost completely.  Her skin doesn't look irritated, like it used to.

I'd definitely recommend this product.",1

he was happy to eat it because all the other

him not comfortable to eat it which I don't know
why until he likes Purina a lot. Thank you",1
"i purchased the 2 port model to power a generic 3"" round air stone and the ViaAqua 12in 2.7 watt Blue & White LED Light & Airstone. Both stones combined fell well within the pumps capabilities.  The side pumping to the ViaAqua is dead.  I switched the lines thinking it was the airstone, but as soon as i plugged in the pump it was obvious i have a defective pump. Disgusted i left the bad side on the 3"" round stone and it won't push one bubble out of it in my 20 gal tank.  The working side is still going strong for now.....  Still debating if it's worth the hassle of returning.  Won't buy ever again.",0
"I have been offering this as one of the foods my Ferrets have access to for years, and have no complaints. It is not as high in Protein/Fat as the Evo was, but as that is discontinued, this is a good alternative. No grains or garbage means I can feed it to my Ferrets without fear.",1
"Treat is very thin not like the imported stuff, my 9 year old Chihuahua had a few teeth pulled due to decay, this stuff is great for her. Highly recommended",1

Received them on time and this size (hard to find) will last my wild birds a long time.,1
"I would not recommend honestly doesn't look anything like the photo was pretty upset because I paid $19 for this and really isn't even pretty to keep in my tank but the frogs like it so I left it in but I honestly give it maybe a week before it completely dies big waste honestly
 update they only lasted one week and when I did go to remove them the whole plant fell apart to pieces and made my water nasty for a couple hour until I fully cleaned it but it was really gross when it fell apart .DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY buy something better!",0
Excellent product. My dog loves it!,1
AMAZING!!!!! FOR GETTING OUT MATS THIS IS TRULY AMAZING!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,1
"which is too bad because it seems like a nice, durable, washable cat bed, but I can't actually say anything about how it holds up or washes. I gave it a week, but my young cat never took a liking to it and refused to stay in it for more than a couple seconds.",0

Great leash,1
"We have two Cairn Terriers that bark and bark and bark we have tried Listerine, Vinegar and nothin works...
We purchased these collars in good faith from a trusted ecommerce site.
We have had these items less than 45 days and the DO NOT WORK junk junk junk!
The batteries are fine but the unit was great while it worked. So now what we are stuck with two junk collars, and nothing in return since it is past 30 days! OF COURSE.
This is why this was my LAST order on Amazon",0
"I purchased one of these sheets in green for my mare and was a little leery of both the color and the fit, since the 74"" size was on sale for a price in the high teens and I went with it over the 72"".  My mare measures as 74"" but is so narrow that blankets that size are often big on her.  Anyway, I got the sheet and it is not only heavier than I expected but fits her perfectly.  The color is amazing and looks really great on her.  It has a very high-end look to it; I keep getting comments on how ""fancy"" it is.

The one thing I would clarify is that this is a canvas sheet.  Yes, canvas is cotton, but it's a bit different from what one generally thinks of when the word ""cotton"" is used.  I was worried about it being too hot but it seems to be fine for my horse in our current temperatures (50s at night and she is in a pipe corral).  It also seems to have been waterproofed, which wasn't mentioned on the product page but is a bonus.

Most importantly, my mare seems to really like it and be comfortable in it.  It stays put beautifully; it's never even crooked when I go out in the mornings.  She lies down in it with no issues and just seems to enjoy having it on more than the crinkly nylon sheets.  I also love that it has shoulder gussets to allow freer movement.  Most stable sheets don't have them for some reason, as if horses don't move around in their stalls.

So for anyone not wanting to read all of that...

BENEFITS:

-Waterproofed
-Made of canvas
-Has shoulder gussets
-Very adjustable fit
-Stays put
-High quality look and feel
-Looks fantastic

Frankly I wish I had bought two of them, and probably will buy an identical one before the winter is over.",1

"I wanted to love this litter mat. It's probably great if all your cat does is fling litter. But if your cat pees over the edge of the box, choose something else!! This is basically a coated piece of foam, not plastic or rubber like I thought. Urine soaked through/around the ""waterproof layer"" and into my hardwood floor, probably through the edging. My floor smells and so does the mat even after scrubbing it down with soapy water. I will be throwing this out and buying something that's actually waterproof.",0
"None of my 3 cats has exhibited any interest at all in this product. I bought it to try & interest two of my cats in eating more canned food, but they are not impressed.

So far it's been worth the money but collar shifts to much and sleeps to easily you really have to give it a good shake I have only used the vibration setting which is enough to get my 56 lb dogs attention pretty decent collar for the money,1

"Did not stick well to my particular fabric upholstery no matter how much rubbing before removing the protective cover, especially on fabric that wasn't taut over structural corners.  Backing tape persnickety even if you support it lengthwise and pull up at the corners. Most corners balled up quickly.  If it did stay on, the open face  would cling to dust, dirt, cat hair,  your hair, and your clothes.  Cat regarded it as a toy and stripped much of it off to chew on and play with its stickiness .
The tiny roll of single-sided clear packing tape from the grocery store is much more cost effective and looks better even if it is shiny.",0

"Cute toys and my cat did love them. They came with some sort of packet in them though. I assume it was cat nip?

"If my dog were writing this review he would give it 5 stars, but since I'm the one who has to clean up after him I rate it just 2. I find that they don't last as long as the compressed rawhide chews and what is worse, when my dog crunches down on these they release little crumbs/shards of Bully stuff everywhere! My dog is only 7 mos. old, a male Doberman, and he will consume one of these in about 40 minutes. Don't get me wrong if you buy these, your dog will love them. Just be prepared for the mess and the fact that you will have to purchase them more often. Did I mention they smell like decay? I didn't mind, but the wife and kids wouldn't go near our pup after consuming one of these.",0
My babies LOVE these.  It's hard to keep them from eating too many.  I think it's crack for dogs!,1

"Well, what can you say about something that lasted for four uses before the fabric unraveled and fell off the frame.  I thought this might just be a defect so I tried to call the company, but none of their lines were ever answered. I wanted this stroller for my handicapped 9 pound dog. I usually read all the reviews on a product before purchasing something, but I missed doing so on this one. If I had, I would have seen that others have complained about this stroller and the fabric problem. I didn't get to use the stroller immediately due to my dog having surgery on her back legs. By the time I found out it was defective, I no longer had the box.
Thank you, Amazon, for working with me on this problem. I give Amazon 6 stars and Great Buy Wholesale a negative 3 stars! This is not a good buy!",0
The 55 Quart container is the perfect size for a 35 lb bag of food. Love the detachable wheels. Keeps food fresh and my dog out.,1
love them,1
"Great Service
Great Product",1
Great concept but it definitely did not fit an XXL large size as I purchased!,0
Not all the bubbles work. Very disappointed.,0
We purchased the orange belts and they are a very different color that what is shown in the picture. They are much lighter and almost neon. My boyfriend thinks they look like they are pink.,0
"The water flows through cleanly and the filter appears to be catching any ""ground dust"" that gets into the water",1
"Absolutely horrible quality. Would never order from this site again. The material was Matty, nothing like the online photo",0
Well that didn't last long. Got the large in today and used a few small pieces of dry food and a couple training treats. It was so tight that nothing would fall out when she rolled it or dropped it so she decided to just eat it in order to get to the food. Not sure exactly how it should have worked and it may work for other pups but not for mine.,0
THIS DID NOT HOLD YOU AT ALL IT LASTED LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE IT FELL APART.,0
"Kitten broke the wing off ,playing with it!!",0
Door hard to open. Really annoying. Other than that its great. My puppy and kitten loves to play in it,0
I ordered flaked and received classic.  My kitten does not like it unless it is the flaked type.  He will eat it in a pinch.  Please make sure your labels match the product inside.,0
Great product!!! Delivered on time.,1
"They where louder than I thought they would be, but I haven't had any issues with the animals, and they work great. The on/off button is a little hard to click, which is annoying, but otherwise great product and great price.",1
Great product! Good service! Thanks!,1
The leash is good and the flashlight is good. The flashlight broke off of the leash within the first 2 days. Our dog is 15 lbs.,0
"This crate is fabulous!  We have a Giant Schnauzer,  and we needed a crate for the family trips and an interstate move. He slept in the crate two days before the move, and about two days after, and during the move. It was easy to set up, it is light, but it is sturdy. Fits perfectly in the Escalade (measure your car, though).  My dog does not destroy his crates, but if you have one that does, that might be an issue. In our case, it fits our needs 100 %",1
My cat LOVES this stuff - and the price is excellent.,1
The measurments are off. The harness is a good idea but didn't fit properly and was too loose. My dog grew some more but still not big enough for the harness.,0
"Didn't work. At times, it seemed like the dogs heard something and paused, but they never stopped barking, and if there was a sound at all, they didn't care about it.",0
"Let me start off by saying that my dog absolutely love the salmon oil. I am glad my dog is enjoying it especially with all the benefits of fish oil. My complain comes from the bottle dispenser. It has been leaking ever since I got my product. Ever time I pump the oil out for my dog, its leaking through the cap. I tighten the cap and there aren't cracks I see at the moment which sucks because I'm losing ozs of oil everytime I pump it and this stuff isn't cheap. I would probably just purchase from another company just cause of the constant leak.",0
"Allows dogs to pant, drink water, and still recurve treats while wearing!
Hope they start to make these in other colors and patterns",1
"Sags more already than my older Coolaroo bed's material ever did, but the dogs like it and the terra cotta doesn't show dirt in our red-dirt backyard!  I love that this bed is self-draining and doesn't have to be emptied out after rainfall.",1
"I've been buying these pads for a year or so, and the last batch have noticeably thinner padding compared to those from the prior order that I still had on hand. After spending money on the boxes, I'm annoyed that the pads are thinner and my choices are to deal with it or throw the boxes out and buy an entirely new system.",0
"Item was great, and came in on time.",1
My dog loves his Whimsies and they keep his teeth SO clean and his breath SO fresh!!!,1
"I was very excited to purchase this for my gerbils, since I felt like the pair of girls were cramped in just a 10 gallon tank.

I used it for about 2 months, when I could no longer stand it anymore!  The first ""floor"" they used the corner as their toilet.  They peed and pooped there.  Much of it ran down both the inside/outside of the tank.  So I had to put a paper towel under the bottom outside corner of the tank to catch the pee spills and poo drops.  There was a strong odor of rodent pee in the house because of this!

They then decided to make a sleeping nest on the top ""floor.""  They love to shred their bedding, and so bedding came out all over the place around the outside of the tank, making the floor a complete mess.

It was very hard to keep clean.  I had to detach the top frequently, take it outside and hose it down and then scrub the hardened pee/poo/hair mess in the corner of the shelves off with a wire brush.  The shelves pop off the walls and are a pain to get back on.  The ramps also come off very easily.

Two stars.  Great concept, gross result!

I purchased a used 30 gallon reptile tank with screen top on craigslist, where the pee, poo and bedding is well contained.  The girls can burrow and climb on their toys to their hearts content.  Much, much better!  Don't recommend this topper.",0
My angel is handicapped and she loves this for outside keeps her under side safe and she can run anywhere she wants,1
great,1
This product DOES NOT work. I have used it faithfully and my Yorkie still needs to have dental surgery. The Vet said it does not work!!!!!,0
We have a mini daschund and the stairs were too far apart for  her short little legs. we returned it,0
Very pleased I finally found some bows like the groomer uses.,1
"Frist one I got was so bad, Looked like 2 rolls of tape was used to hold it together. The House was smash, wood was broke in a few places as well. I ordered a replacement, just got it today.
Box was worse then the frist one, this house inside looked like it was put together & took apart a few times & the wood was broke & split in mutli places. I called & going to try a second replacement, we'll see how that goes.

UPDATE:  I got the thrid one, Box was held together w/ only 1 roll of tape.
The hinges that hold the top on were ripped out & the wood was in 3 pieces.
A few large dents & cracks on a few parts, 3 of 3 all trash.

This dog house is very cheap the walls are bearly 1/4 in. The flooring is the same, For an X-large house a +60 LB. dog might break through the floor, The roof is thin as well, a mid-large dog might break though it if jumping on it.
People that gave this 5 stars must be using it inside the home or small dogs.
Needless to say I wouldn't get one of these.",0
"Loved emainto the dogs. Great sense of humor. Their vet won't allow OTHER chewers - raw hide pig ears, etc. thank you",1
Does fit as expected.,0
Works great with my cat that is prone to urinary tract flair ups.,1
Great little toy. Durable and bouncy. Definitely recommend for your dogs! Just be sure to check the size cause I bought a mini - and it sure it mini! :P,1
My 10 month old dog chewed this up in less than a week,0
Dog really didn't like it.,0
My dog looks like a model in this! So many complements. The only problem is that he has a long body. Girth width fits perfect. Wish it was 4 inches longer to cover up to his tail. Bought it in two colors. Mocha and beige (off white beige),1
Excellent construction of materials. Batterys don't last very long...only downside. Also the unit shuts off when my dog shakes his head.,0
"We used to love these balls.  They are the perfect size for our little dog.  They bounce well, they last well.  This was my third time to order them because we like them so much.  However, the odor on this last batch is so noxious that I am having to return them.  The entire contents of the amazon box was rank with the smell.  My hands smell after just holding the balls for a minute.  It's not a normal rubber type odor.  Being that they are Made in China, I won't take any chances with whatever toxin is making them smell so badly this time around.  Back they go.  Hopefully this was just a bad batch and we will be able to get them again in the future.",0
"This is the first bed Ive ever purchased for our kitty. I was concerned she wouldnt ever use it. Boy was I wrong; She LOVES it!!  If you're considering this product, do not hesitate.",1
Doesn't seem to read the temp in the tank at all.  Bummed.,0
"I have been looking for a way to walk my dogs for awhile now and was excited when I received the dog harness. When I opened it up, I first noted how strong and durable it was. The stitching is strong and the harness itself is very well padded. I felt that if my dogs were to pull at all, they would be comfortable and not placed in any distress. The adjustment strap that goes under the bellly is adjustable and fit all three of my dogs comfortably. The latch has a red circle that you press up or down to release or lock the latch in place. This made me more relaxed knowing that it would be difficult for my dog to break free but yet comfortable for them as well.
Your personal leash for your dog attaches on the back of the harness. It is also strong and durable. The is a handle also in which you can grab your dog with in case you need your pet close to you and unable to run.
All three of my dogs became very comfortable with the harness in less than 2 days. They were taking turns being walked with it and had no problems at all. When finished walking, we were also able to take the harness off very easily. This is another positive. I feel this harness is everything it is meant to be and more.
I did receive the harness at a discount in return for an honest and true review of it. All thoughts and opinions are my own. I am extremely pleased with this harness and thinking of buying two more for my other dogs. I would recommend this harness to anyone who has trouble walking their dog with the everyday leash and wants to protect their dog from injury and yourself from dog pulling.",1
"I used this on a small area of my basement carpet, and all this product did was make my entire house smell like ginger-covered cat urine. Even when properly diluted, this stuff has an extremely strong scent that lingers for a long time. I have been trying to air out the odor for over 24 hours, to no avail. Now I'm looking for two new products - one that will actually get rid of the cat urine, and one to get rid of the awful Thornell smell that is now permeating my home.

Edited to add: It's now been a week since I used this product. The smell has lessened, but has not gone away. My house still stinks like musty ginger. I have tried multiple times to clean my carpet where I used the Thornells, and nothing has taken the disgusting ginger smell out - vinegar, baking soda, commercial deodorizing products, not even cleaning with a carpet shampooer! I get headaches daily from the lingering fumes.

If you buy this product, I hope you love the smell...because it's never going away!",0
"good,  my cat flies now",1
Looks great at party's. It's really fun and good quality. It's not one of those hats that can't be used over and over because it's falling apart. This hat is great quality and the kids love it.,1
Great product.,1
"Overpriced, took too long and its scratched my glass don't buy it",0
"This is not a good product. It is not solid, it falls apart easily and it is very difficult to put in the water bottle. Don't buy this product.",0
This has not cured her (7 year old female yellow lab)  arthritis but has slowed or even stopped it's spreading. She has been taking this pill for over one year and likes it just as a treat. I'm just hoping this trend will continue.,1
Worthless!  Dont waste your money.  The zipper broke first use.,0
Doesn't work no matter how much or how often you adjust it.,0
"Perfect height for my large dogs. They like these so much better than a bowl on the ground and look forward to mealtimes. Fast shipping, great product.",1
These are not like the Yak Chews I had bought from others. these broke into pieces and were not safe to even give the dogs. I have never had brittle yak chews. Will not purchase this brand again.,0
"I thought this toy would be great for my 9 week old bullmastiff puppy, however he doesn't really like to chew on it.  I tried spreading peanut butter in it and that helped but it's too difficult for him to get it out and it was a horrible pain to clean out.  I then tried just some small treats stuffed in it and he enjoys it a little more but he gets them quick and doesn't want anything to do with it again.  I don't know if it's because of the super strong rubber smell or something else.",0
"This scoop does only ONE function well--it lets the loose litter fall quickly through the scoop.  Beyond that, it's totally USELESS!!

It was clearly designed by someone who has never scooped anything, let alone a litter box!!!

First, it's FLAT!! Ever try balancing a ping pong ball on the paddle? Then you'll see the problem here. Try keeping rounded clumps and other rounded shapes (#2's) on a flat scoop!  A normal scoop secures the clump in a curved bottom.  This genious missed class when it came to the concept of how a spoon works!!

Second, much like the first,the handle is also FLAT!!!  There's no curve! Without the curve, your wrist has to do all the contorting to keep the scoop level to keep the clump from rolling off!  It's actually painful if you're over 50 and have more than one box to scoop like I do!  Try putting the scoop into the litter box at a normal downward angle but then lifting out the entire scoop in a perfectly horizotally FLAT position!  It gets even more difficult with less than large boxes because you can't get it level without hitting the scoop or your wrist on the sides of the box!

Third, the really complicated part the desinger also skipped class--this scoop has virtually no side edges!! I'm sure I don't have to explain the problem with that.

If they had add the improved sieve design onto a ""normal"" scoop, they would've brought a better than average scoop to the market--it would've been a great scoop. But, whoever designed this one clearly thought they were so clever they could design-out ALL the features that makes a scoop work!  What a genious!

Don't buy this scoop!  Get one that works!!",0
Do not buy,0
"Fell apart after a few months of use, and are not dryer safe.",0

"Unfortunately, though the picture shows orange balls that you might be able to find if the dog drops them in a big field, the actual products shipped to me each contained one blue and one GREEN ball.  I can't imagine why Chuckit would even make a green ball that you'll never be able to find in the grass, unless their goal is to sell a lot of replacements.  But order here and that's what you may get (""Colors May Vary"").  Maybe this is the only way Chuckit can unload them.",0
"am trying many diff treats and snacks (most are amazon add-ons) for 4yr old new adoptee.  he prefers the moist snacks and  buries most dry treats.  his 1st pkg of this type - lamb and rice, went over well.  but...he won't touch this flavor, even to bury.  out of 10 diff brands and flavors of dry treats in his morning dry treat bowl, this was the only bone left.  2 days in a row.  this bison formula  he obviously rates 1 star.",0
"This 35lb bag of dog food comes packaged in a box that has hand grip holes on either  side to help manage the bag before opening. Seems like a good idea for stores but online I received  a bag, inside a box, inside a larger box. A waste of alot of packaging. That aside, the food is great. Has great benefits for large breed dog joints and added vitamins. I love  that  it has no added colors or preseratives. Our dogs are like family and we like a more natural option for their dog food. They really seem to like the food too. No upset bellies from the change, but we did transition it in with a mix of their current  brand food. The kibble has a nice  texture, not to hard, not to soft.",1
"I have been buying this product for several years now. I had always bought the 30 lb bag. This time I bought the 15 lb bag.

The food now has a very distinct smell that I never noticed before. My dog will no longer eat it - unless I don't give him any other food and he's too hungry. Finally, after a few weeks, he got really sick and wouldn't eat the food at all. I started feeding him different food. He got better after a couple of  weeks. When I put him on the TOTW again, he got sick AGAIN! Vomiting, lethargic and low energy (I have a Jack Russell terrier who is always very energetic).

I then started reading the reviews online and noticed that there were a number of similar complaints, most very recent.

Either something changed in quality or the 15 lb bags are produced differently or at a different location.",0

"Excellent quality for the price. Assembly took less than 5 minutes, just unfold & lock together. Fast delivery with Amazon Prime.",1
We set this up in less than 30 minutes.  Our shock is set on a very low setting (2) and works like a charm for our boxer/retriever mix.  We practiced according to the training instructions for 2 days and then our dog was accustomed to the warning beeps.  She can go out without her collar on now and still stay within the containment area.  I highly recommend this product.  It has saved us a lot of trouble with our wandering dog!,1
These are so adorable and soft. They are a little baggy on my little one but we are making them work. They will be perfect for bedtime.,1
Best hides ever. My picky dog loves it but he likes the beef and chicken flavor more than salmon.,1
"First, the noise this thing makes ( loud grinding) when it dispenses food scares my one dog so bad she won't go near it.  Then there's the horrible sound quality of the recording.  You can't understand anything you say in it.  Last but not least is that the on/off button is in the back, so if the dog pushes the bowl back to the wall, it shuts off and you have to start all over again with programming (yes, there is zero memory in this thing).  I expected more for what I paid.  What a waste of money.",0

This batch of dog food of the beef stew was contaminated!  Please QC the dog food.  It made my dog extremely ill. I had to throw it all out. ,0
don't waste your money and it slides all over the place,0
Over powering orange.  Not sure if it actually removed the smell of cat pee or just covered it. Expect an EXTREMELY STRONG orange smell for at least a day or 2 in the rooms you use it,0
"We bought these for our dogs last December. They arrived on time and looked as expected. We keep them as dog house liners outside in Seattle, so they see a lot of rain/mud/leaves. We don't machine wash them, they have loops at one end so we hang them outside and spray and hose them down to wash them off. They take a few hours to dry on a sunny day, which is a rare thing in Seattle, so we often hang them in the basement instead so they can be placed back for bed time at night.

Its been a year now and the middle section is getting thin. I'm looking back now to see if I'll reorder or buy something different. The outside edge is still padded (they are more snuggly padded on the outside from day 1 anyway), but the middle is pretty much done.

For the price and 12 months of use, with regular hosing down, I've been happy with these beds. But I might try something else to see if the padding holds up.",1
"So let me preface this review by saying I'm a GoDog supporter, I really enjoy their products (and so does my 8 month old Lab puppy). I've gotten their GoDog dinosaurs (both pink and blue) and they have this like kevlar lining and are indestructible (with the exception of the small tag).

This guy, not so much, his head is filled with stuffing and within an hour was destroyed. The rest of the body appears to be made of a stronger material, so it's now like a flat Stanley that the pup drags around the house and plays with.

I was expecting something much more durable and long lasting for my dedicated chewer, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a chew resistant toy and I wouldn't buy again.",0
Actually I have a Main coon cat one year old . which fe's pretty big and tall . and he loves not having to bend down to the floor to eat . Sturdy and well made.,1

"I bought this wireless fence after reading through tons and tons of reviews. We decided to go with this version as it has a rechargeable battery which is a lot better than having to replace the batteries. This collar was a dream come true for about 3 months and worked great. My golden retriever puppy stayed in our mostly square 1 acre yard which has a very busy road that's very close. He got shocked a few times and he was so scared to go towards the invisible line for months after that. But after 3 months the collar started going off randomly when our puppy was outside wearing it and he would come running to me and was literally crying out loud because it was shocking him and he didn't do anything wrong. I read the directions and it said that things can interfere with it, but there was nothing around.... now we have had it about 5 months and if we leave the collar sitting on the table it will Just randomly beep and shock several times. I recently went out to test the invisible fence to see if the collar even beeped where it was supposed to, and I was happy to find that it did still work and I tested the shock with my hand (it hurts), however my dog is apparently so used to it going off whenever it wants, he is no longer scared of the beep and shock and has learned that he can just break the fence and keep going without a problem. I had already gone over the return policy date when it stopped working properly and the return instructions stated that I needed to return the system and they would determine if it were defective. Honestly I just didn't want to deal with it, so we keep using it to attempt to scare him, and we run like crazy to get it off him when it goes off in the house for no reason. We really wanted to be excited about this collar, but we aren't.",0

"I bought this harness for my Catahoula Leopard Hound; she weighs about 40 lbs and the harness fit her very nicely. I attach her to a running line during the day when I'm at work, and I was disappointed to find that the first day she wore the harness, she was able to rip the mesh part, and by the second day she had managed to rip it completely in half and was off the line. I understand that mesh is not my any means indestructible, but I was expecting it to last longer than 48 hours :(",0
"Have owned this collar for 14 months. I hunt and train with two dogs nearly every day of the year.
Battery life is poor. Other collar systems are far better.
Pretty good design for a one dog system. Easy enough to program and figure out.
This is a total failure for multi-collar use. Garmin has provision for up to three collars with this system. The remote is poorly designed for multiple dog field use.
Addressed the battery charge life issue with Garmin support when the unit was one week out of warranty.
Garmin would not support the product.
SportDog support offered a new replacement system at half price when a five year old collar failed. Will buy from SportDog again.
Garmin may own the market for avionics. They sure do not with dog collars.",0

Its a lie,,that thing was out in the middle of the room for weeks and he never showed interest in it. He likes other toys like feather teasers and chew on toys,maybe thats why. The thing is so light that when i tried putting him on top of it ,it seemed that thing was going to break,,it was sinking in because of the weight of my cat. My cat got scared probably thinking it wasn't going to hold him and the minute i let go of him he took off running to hide. HORRIBLE.WASTE OF MONEY.",0

Also, the doggy bag holders are terrible with regards to staying closed, I have to tape it shut or pick up entire rolls of dog bags when they fall out on a regular basis.

I got two bags via subscription before canceling. Why did I cancel: 1. Low quality seeds that the birds were not really interested in as much as other seeds I have purchased. 2. A lot more mess and leftovers. 3. Constantly having to clean out the feeders because the seeds start growing plants in the feeders! They then block up the holes so birds can't get seeds out and then turns into this sort of sludge at the bottom (that smells terrible and is hard to get out). Definitely problematic if you live somewhere that rains a lot or you have your feeders somewhere with sprinklers. 4. I have never had this experience with other seeds before but there were things in the bag of seeds that were not seeds. Husks and twigs or something. Only reasons I didn't give this one star was price and well it kept the squirrels away as the seeds didn't carry the value they apparently wanted.,0

"You only need to try this and see it to see how superior it is to any commercial kibble on the market. I don't care how ""premium"" it claims to be. Just look at the ingredients in this. It is OBVIOUSLY healthy. Only thing better would be making my own meals for my dogs. I just don't have the knowledge and the time to do this though.
This is what I consider to be the next best thing.  (And I have tried just about everything)",1
so far best pads i purchased.... no runny pee or wet floor,1
"I have a big dog that can take apart almost anything. While he can get these suckers out, he loves 'em and does not eat the furniture. That's all that matters to me!",1
"The idea of this kit isn't bad-- it includes most of what you need (other than the terrarium, substrate, and a heat source). However, most of what it included ended up being problematic.

1. Water dish-- the water dish is made of marbled resin and fits in a corner. It's nice, but mine had a big crack in it and immediately leaked out any water I put in it.

2. Water bowl-- this is Fluker's ""lagoon"" model, small size, and I love it-- it is a bathing pool with steps so that the crab can easily get in or out. However, mine did not hold water. It did not have an obvious crack like the water dish, but it drained more quickly than it should have had it only been under the effects of evaporation. After returning this kit I bought two Fluker's lagoon bowls to use for both fresh and salt water (the one in this kit is green; the separately sold ones are tan).

3. Food dish-- marbled resin like the other two products, this does a fine job of holding food.

4. Sponge-- the sponge is pretty small (half a golf ball?), but seems fine. I think sponges are overrated.

5. Crab pellets-- I have no issue with these.

6. Fresh water conditioner-- this is okay, but it requires four drops to 8 oz of water-- twice as much as Zoomed, and a lot more than some other conditioners. What's really bad is, it does not come in a dropper bottle or with a dropper. Considering you're going to need like 18 drops to do 2 liters of water, not having a dropper is extremely problematic. The Zoomed conditioner comes in a dropper bottle.

7. Salt water conditioner-- this is fine; it's 1 tsp per 8oz, same as Zoomed, and no need for a dropper here.

8. Thermometer-- I don't like this much; only even numbered temperatures are labeled-- it goes from 60 to 80 with just a dash for 70, which I think makes it hard to read.

9. Hydrometer-- this is easier to read than the thermometer, and I like it fine. Impossible to know how accurate it is, but it certainly goes gradually up when I spray water, and slowly goes down as the tank dries out.

10. Empty Growth Shells-- these are nice enough; fairly large, too big for my crab. No way of knowing if they'll be the right size for your crabs, but it never hurts to have extras.

11. Spray bottle-- this works nicely, though honestly you can buy an adjustable misting bottle just like this at the dollar store for $1.

The kit also annoying recommends buying a calcium supplement but doesn't actually include any.

I might give this kit four stars or five stars if not for the leaky dishes and lack of a dropper for the fresh water conditioner, but those are big problems for me. I ended up returning it.",0
"Item in picture is not what you get. Seller needs to change the item picture to just the product listed. Very dissapointed when I contacted the seller my response was just that the item has shipped.

"I live in an open apartment complex, and was looking for something to help keep my 8 month old puppy in her boundaries. I tried walking her around the perimeter with a choke collar to show her areas that were off limits, but she would still run off. I did extensive research on training collars and decided to go with this one. It has a larger range than most I was looking at and it has the positive and negative tone which I really liked. It only took a few times for my puppy to figure out what each of the tones and static shock meant. I have had this product for a little over a month and I could not be happier. I do not have to use the static control much anymore, and if I do it is on the lowest level and she comes running! I am very pleased! I would definitely recommend this product!",1
It doesn't work!,0
It's great for picking up poop.  I could never put a bag on my hand and pick it up!  This helps you scoop it right into the bag with no hassle or mess.,1
"I was so excited to finally receive this product (it took a long time to get it) and just knew my cat would love it since she loves her catnip. I took it out of pack and couldn't smell the nip. Well, obviously, my cat didn't either. She looked at it, looked at me and walked away and still hasn't had anything to do with it.",0
"Great purchase, fits our dog perfectly!",1
"So I bought this from Amazon based on the many positive reviews of this bowl and figured that even if the bubbles didn't work, I still had a pretty decent sized water tower for my dog. Turns out I was horribly wrong.

The first unit arrived and I cleaned it like I would do if I was buying something for myself, I don't want my dog to drink up packing dust and whatever else might be on/in the bowl. After doing so I set it up and filled the tank. The water filled the bowl and I didn't notice any problems. I set up the bubbler and it seemed to work, but I noticed that one side was definitely bubbling a LOT more then the other. I didn't think too much of it and walked away, not quite sure what to do with the air pump that kind of just sits there (they do NOT provide a place underneath this thing for the pump, so it just has to sit at the back of the unit.)

I come back to see how its going and maybe fit the pump under the unit when i felt water underneath the bowl. I quickly picked it up and noticed there was a hole underneath the bowl about the size of a .5mm headphone jack, maybe a little bit bigger. I also noticed this hole is there due to poor manufacturing because I saw how the bowl is molded together and it seems to...lack at where the hole is. I thought this might be a single problem and might be able to fix it myself. I dumped the water out and got some epoxy out...which is when I noticed that the air tubes were cracked which is why it was bubbling more on one side then the other. I was like ok, this is BS so I'm going to have amazon send me a new one.

Amazon quickly replaced the unit with another one. This unit had the SAME PROBLEM. The air hoses are directly on top of the hole so you THINK this will cover the problem but it does not. The unit still leaks water...and honestly if you are making a bowl for a dog to hold WATER there should not be ANY HOLES AT ALL...oh but the air hoses weren't cracked this time...

This pretty much ends my review of this, I hope they manage to fix this problem because this is a good idea but with poor manufacturing processes and horrible quality review (honestly if there was ANY quality review this would have been caught and fixed.) this will never get anywhere. I will have to take my business elsewhere.",0
My Betta didn't like it because it's too big for his tank but my turtle loves it.,1
Does not work on the semi long hair dogs like jack Russells will be sending it back,0
"The reason i gave this product 2 stars was because the expiration date was July, 2014.  Unfortunately, i gave this product as a ""doggie gift"" to my neighbor and when I inquired as to how the dog enjoyed the treats, he reluctantly (the owner)
told me about the expiration date.  I offered to have it replaced, but he declined because he did not want to inconvenience me.",0
Started loosing fish next day after starting treatment. So not sure if it is a faulty product or just bad timing!,0
"Fantastic stuff! My dog has very bad allergies and tends to scratch and chew himself raw in places to the point his skin gets very red and irritated. This has calmed his issue spots and not only are they no longer angry red, but he's actually starting to regrow hair in these spots. He usually throws a fit whenever I put anything on his bald patches, this I just showed him the jar and he came right to me wagging his tail. I knew this was making him feel better, but actually came to have me put it on him was unbelievable! It smells great and I enjoy putting it on him as I get to rub the excess into my hands. It makes my hands sooo soft without being greasy. This stuff is amazing and I wish I would have come across it years ago.",1
Doesn't keep my cats interest.  Oh well,1
Read the description wrong. Thought it came with the crate. No. Its just the cover. Only reason i returned it is because i already have one,0
I've replaced it twice already with the same issue--stops working after 4 months. Thought the first time we got a lemon but now that the second one is out as well know there is a product design error. Hard water deposits underneath and is impossible to scrub off without scratch the hec out of the plastic light cover. Electrical board fries from what I'm guessing is condensation from tank. Love the brightness of the light and two options of day and moon light but really doesn't matter if the product doesn't last as long.,0
"One of my dogs literally inhales her food and I was worried that she would come to some serious harm as a result of her food being partially inhaled, It was pretty scary, she would eat really fast and then stand there choking and trembling for long periods of time, We tried everything with her, but nothing changed her eating pattern, it was just her nature.

I ordered one of these bowls for her and it was a revelation! From the first moment, she was forced to completely change her eating speed, she slowed way down and did not cough and choke anymore. The bowl is light and the more intense she becomes about eating,the more the bowl slides around on the floor..... thus slowing her down considerably!

This bowl has probably saved her life, I recommend this to one and all. The bowl is well-constructed,the whole point of it being made from plastic is that the bowl will slide around on the floor.  The sliding prohibits the dog from gulping down large quantities of food in one bite. I highly recommend this bowl for use with pets that eat much too quickly.",1
"Don't follow all the crap on line about these treats, my puppies have been eating this product for years now, it's like any treat all in moderation.",1
Works great. Thanks.,1
"My new little Yorkie puppy loved this toy, although she had the squeaker ripped out literally the first day!  At that time, she wasn't even 2pounds yet!  Once the squeaker was out the stuffing followed.  Cheap junk.",0
Way too small for my Pomeranian. I bought medium and they were too small.,0
"Beware This Dog Bed! I don't think my Chihuahua likes it much.  She hadn't peed in the house for two months or in her bed for three months.  I felt she was finally house broken.  Then, in less than a week, she peed in this new bed. Yes, the cover is washable.  But it's as thin as a pillow-case.  What is inside is nothing but a shaped piece of foam with a heater embed in it.  In only one week, my Chihuahua puppy has managed to pull hundreds, if not thousands of pieces from the foam without even yet tearing through the cover. When I took the cover off to wash it I had to use a vacuum to get all the pieces of foam off the inside of the cover so they wouldn't clog up my washing machine.  Getting the cover back over the molded foam is a project all its own.  My puppy hasn't peed in the house again in the few days I've been drying out the hosed down foam mold.  We'll see what happens when I try it again one more time.  But I wouldn't recommend this bed to anyone.  At the very least it needs a heavier shaped cover to prevent a dog from digging through it and to facilitate putting back on after removal.",0
Doesn't work,0
"I have a 6 pound yorkie and these just fit.  They don't stay on well.  The velcro holds but they slip off the legs easily.  On the plus side, they do inhibit urinating.",0
My cat loves this. He used to be an outdoor cat but no longer- this tent gives him 'outdoor time' while remaining safe and warm. I added a few of his cozy blankets.,1
"This is just a piece of tempered wire with some small, pressed cardboard rolls on it. Don't waste your money on this item.",0
The dog's like them.  They are about the size of a mint.,1
"dead on delivery, rotted.  sorry but ,",0
I have a 2yr.old pug and she was diganosed with a liver disease so the vet started her on this medicine.... It was 40.00 every month and I found it on Amazon a lot cheaper which really helps when you are on a tight budget.... Thanks Amazon for offering it.....,1
Excellant product and price,1
It did not phase my puppy one bit,0
"I really like these feeders, but I used them outside in an area that was not covered.  They are not fun to clean up after getting wet.  If used in a dry area, they are absolutely wonderful!",1
"For the price it can't be beat. My finches definitely find this seed to be okay. Hard to manage such a large bag, but I keep a large Rubbermaid pouring container filled which makes getting it in the feeder fairly easy.",1
VERY cute but TOO small for 13lb Shih tzu. I had to exchange for large size. I was expecting thin Tshirt fabric but this is heavier w/some stretch. Nice quality.,1
Good quality. My cat loves it!,1
"The cage was much bigger than I expected which was great to give more room for my golden retriever. Price was great, no complaints here!",1
Love it. Pet name is laser engraved into metal. It has been 5 months and I see no sign of name fading. Size is also just right.,1
"We had good success for a little over a month but they are now totally ineffective.  Just returned from the groomer who works in one of the large pet supply chains.  She told us that many people are returning them and the chain is accepting returns since they obviously do not last more than a month or so, let alone the eight months claimed by the seller.",0
"FOR A LITTLE PET,EXCELENT.SHE LOVES IT",1
This is my 12 lb dog's favorite bed and he has many...it is so soft both in texture and padding.,1
This brush is perfect!! The goats love it and the flexibility makes it comfortable on my hand while giving perfect coverage. About to order another!,1
"It's a great toy, the dogs love it.  I love the tail that moves independently from the goose.  Really, really love it.",1
Fun toys my dog loves to play with great quality too!,1
BEST item I have bought to keep my dog in the car. It fits GREAT and it helped him to relax and lay down in the car instead of trying to constantly climb into the front seat.,1
I liked the idea of the crate but the walls are to thin. My German Shepard tore right through the mesh on the second time putting him in it.,0
"Per size chart, this muzzle was way tooo a

"We have 2 cats.  We used a Litter-Robot for many years with great success but when it died and I discovered the cost to replace the circuit board and/or the base unit we simply couldn't afford it, that led to buying and LOVING the Litter Spinner.  It's sturdy, clean, easy to use and as long as you use a good clumping cat litter it functions very well.  It is easy to spin when used, empty the filter unit into a small bag and you have a clean litter box again.  The cats accepted it immediately by the way.",1
"Do not buy this toy if your dog has teeth.  My 10lb min pin destroyed it w/in seconds and stuffing was everywhere.  A personal best for him, but the worst for me.  I didn't want to give any stars, but I could not submit my review w/out giving at least one.",0
"Although they were effective for many years these formulas, Advantix, Advantage and Frontline no longer work in a lot of areas including the Northwest. Apparently the flea population has developed immunity.  Im now using a monthly pill as advised by my Vet and its working. However, I still have to treat the carpet and yard in order to combat the infestation. I cant believe it but, Im hoping for at least 2 weeks of freezing weather this winter to help kill off this excessive flea population.",0

"We bought it for the height, which is perfect. The bowls are a little larger than needed but our dog seems to like them. It's very sturdy. Rather than marsala, red color like the picture would have been preferred.",1
"I bought it and it is wonderful. I have an Elephant Ear, Half-moon Double Tail, and a Butterfly. I added a Betta Buddy (Marimo Moss) Balls in each section, set the current flow to the minimum and they love it. I disconnect for feeding and leave like that as long as I want and then reconnect. They seems happy, I've attached a picture.",1
"This toy is a huge hit with both of our cats. They love to bat the ball around and around, and it keeps them entertained for a long time. I recommend adding the grooming arch, sold separately.",1
In my experience Siberian's are picky eaters. Not with this food - she loves it.,1
"Didnt block scent, didn't puff up at all so not worth the price.",0
highly recommend my dogs love them and they help with there teeth.,1
I was hoping that this would be very easy and fun for my dog and I. But the gun is very loud and hard to pull back; it doesn't go very far either.,0
"We bought this home for our ferret thinking it would be a great first home for her. Well as soon as I started putting it together I felt I made the wrong decision with purchasing this home. The bars of the cage were bent in about 5-6 places. When putting the hook into the eye inorder to form the cage it kept falling apart, the problem was the hook was loose and kept sliding out of the eye. I ended up using pliers to bend them smaller. Once the home was put together and it was time to put in the different floors the only issue that I found was 1 floor would pop out shortly after it being snapped in. I had no way to fix it so unfortunately I have to just keep an eye on it. If I wasn't in need of the home for my ferret I would have sent it back.",0
"I have used K9 Advantix II for the last 3  years and love it. I am not sure if I received a bad batch or what, this product did not work as it usually does. I applied on May2 and less than 2 weeks later I had to reapply my dog had so many fleas. 2nd dose has been on for 48hours and still covered in fleas. Bathed her today in flea shampoo and combed everything out(eggs and fleas) will have to purchase more because this did not do the job! Extremely dissatisfied!!!!!!",0
Nice size and good beam.,1
Bought for my 2 pet rats. This ball is way bigger than I imagined for a much cheaper price than in stores. It's very nice. Our ratties love exploring the house in it :),1
"My dog has a bad habit of jumping in the front seat when I get out of the car to run errands. The safety leads (I use both of them) work perfect on the two metal rings on either side of his vest. They fit securely in my SUV seat belt fasteners.

Great buy to avoid doggy distractions.",1
"These are pretty sturdy. My German Shepherd has a significant history of destroying his toys within the first 20 minutes of getting them. This usually lasts at least a few months before he finally tears the seam apart. The squeeker doesn't always last as long, but it's still one of his favorite toys.",1
Nice size and quality. Would order again,1
"The piece arrived quickly. As my boyfriend and I were building we noticed a damaged area and the towel rack was missing. We contacted the seller, who was more than apologetic, and they quickly rectified the problem. They frequently updated me with order progress and tracking information for the new piece. Now that the cage is perfectly assembled, it looks great!! It's pretty sturdy and helps masks the fact that we need to keep the litter box in our kitchen. Now we just need to convince our cat to use it AFTER we eat dinner!!",1
sorry  My  Boston  Terrier would not eat it.  I'll admit she is very picky.,0
This tropical mix has so many yummy things in it! My hamster loves it!,1
"No, neither did the company.  Product is misrepresented.  Faulse advertising.  Mill bounces with a 60 lb dog.  Cant imagine a 120 pound dog",0
"Highly recommend! I prefer these Kong Stuff""N Ziggies to place in my dog's Kong toy over the cookies.  It takes my dog 3x longer to get through the treat vs. the cookies.  However, you get less of these treats than if you buy the Kong Stuff'N cookies.",1
"This is awesome! Cats love it. They stopped throwing up everywhere after switching to it!

a lot healthier than the cheap food u can buy at Wal-Mart or something.

I have it on auto ship for once a month on the 6lb bag",1
I like the rod the rope keeps getting knotted and the metal part broke so now the rope is shorter and the other part was replaced.,0
"This is the worst litter I have ever used.  It does not clump, it spreads dust all over the room and into anything that sits in the room.",0
"It was a very useful item to buy. I had nine German Shepherd puppies this year, in the middle of the desert summer and I had to put them inside my house for a few hours a day because of the heat. This play pen would offer the right space for the nine of them to sleep inside or play inside for the first six weeks, it's big and can be shaped any way you wish so it adapts to whatever room you have in your home for your dogs. It was a good buy.",1
Exactly as advertised. Nicely finished good hardware.,1
Works well enough for dog's IBS.  My dog seems to like it but loves Iams sensitive.,1
Works good as a deterrent-I don't have to spray it-just show it and my dog gets down.,1
Very handy!,1
Mesh top with velcro attachments. Works well for smaller dogs or puppies. I wouldn't recommend for larger dogs or for ones that can easily escape enclosures. I have enjoyed it while my Retriever was 8-13 weeks old.,1
"Oh my goodness. I can barely stand to be in my apartment with this litter. I have two cats, and normally when I walk into my apartment, I smell nothing. I took for granted that I used a good litter. The ads for this made it sound amazing, so I thought it was worth a try. It does not hide any odors. As soon as my cat poops, I know it; not so with my other litter. It also barely clumps, I have all these tiny pieces that roll off and escape when when I scoop. So I always feel that the litter is ""dirty"" even after one use. I normally buy: Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, Unscented. That is a product I would recommend to anyone. I now know how magical it is after trying Multi-Cat Clump&Seal.  I would not wish Clump and Seal on my worst enemy. And I don't agree that you should have to take 10 other precautions to not have a smelly house if you have cats. With Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, I had to do nothing extra to have a dwelling that did not stink.  I would not recommend this to someone that had one cat, much less multiple.",0
"never really got the hang of it, hard to tell what setting it is on",0

Tag must be very close to sensor to work. Didn't love it,0
My dog thought it was a treat.  Sprayed it on my hand and he locked it off and wanted more.  Useless,0
Our cat loves this new toy. It is perfect for tossing into the air for her to catch. It provides good exercise for our indoor cat.,1
"I purchased this item about 6 months ago.  Yes this is unstable like I've read in other reviews.  Luckily this defect is obvious and easily fixed, so in my opinion this aspect is of little danger to a kitty of a smart pet owner.  The real problem is with the hanging ball.  It does not hang from sting as you'd assume, instead it's elastic.  Yesterday, my kitty Joe was playing with the ball and the elastic somehow wrapped around his little paw.  Thank God my boyfriend was home for lunch.  He heard Joe's cries from across the house.  Joe's hind legs were on the ground and he was stretched to his entire length because one of his front paw was trapped in the elastic.  My boyfriend said it was wrapped around it really good and as it only got tighter as Joe tried to rip his paw free, there is no way this cat would've gotten free on it's own.  It was wrapped so tight my boyfriend had use scissors to cut Joe free.  It makes me sick to think what cou'dve happened.  If you have this item or plan on getting it.  Please please remove the ball toy first.  It's just not worth the fear and potential danger.",0
Does not work properly. The bowl does not fill but only an about an inch of water. I think the top is too long tallow the water to flow,0
The package of medicine was already opened when it arrived. I will not be using this on my pets and will be requesting a refund.,0
Fits perfectly on my 17 lb chihuahua terrier.,1
These DO NOT FIT. I ordered a size larger to be safe and my 8 mo old boxers won't fit in a large. Nearly tore it getting it off of them.,0
"I have nothing against Canidae as a brand; I have fed their wet cat food to my kittens and cats for years with no adverse side-effects, but when I tried the Pure Land lamb formula dog food on my puppy (label says it is fine for puppies) he immediately started having loose stool.
I feed my borzoi puppy a grain free diet- Solid Gold dry food topdressed with a rotation of grain-free wet food brands, and this is the only food he has had loose stool on.
I didn't even finish the can; I threw it out and went back to Merrick's and Evanger's, and sure enough, his stools firmed right back up.
I'm sure some dogs do well on this, but not mine. I will definitely not purchase this again, and please exercise caution when feeding this food to puppies.",0
"My Jack Russell Terrier loves these! Originally bought extra large - they lasted for over a year. Nice clean product, no grease or warnings about washing your hands after handling as on other types of dog chews. Love the fact that they are organic and a ""good for your dog"" product.",1
My cats went crazy over this toy.  They love it.,1
My puppy loves her chair! One of my best buys.,1
"*updated review- 4 starts to 2* I found that the jars are not air tight. My dog started having heavy  diarrhea. After trial and error I found that the food in the jar was bad, causing his upset stomach.
The top has a plastic piece on it that the lid clips over to lock it in place. I'm worried after one too many open/closes that the piece will break off, thus making the jar not airtight. However until that happens (if it does) I'm satisfied with this purchase.",0
As soon as I plugged it in the bulb blew. And I do not have the option to return. I had bought this item in June and it literally last one month not sure why Im getting defective bulbs,0
"worked sometimes and then not, not worth the money, sold this a month later on craigslist, save your cash and buy something else",0
"Don't last at all! Payed $6.47 for a Large bone for My German shepherd Zeus.
He had it torn up in 15 minutes. A dollar store toy last him longer.
Just such a rip off!!",0
This toy would only survive a tiny bug playing with it. It would not survive a small dog. Should not even get one star.,0
"Our cats took right it, both for the litter box and for layng on top of it to watch out the window above it.  Heavy and nicely constructed.",1
The steps are to narrow,0
Cats love it. They eat less than the cheapy food and their coats are so shiny they look like s shampoo commercial.,1
Very tight. My cat cried when I tried to use it. Returned.,0
"Worked great for a few months very light use, then stopped working.  If they could make it last, I would consider it again.",0
The paint started flaking off in big chunks after a month in the water. Disappointing.,0
Looks good in fish tank,1
The braided portion has come unraveled on the first day.  My dog is not especially strong or vicious.,0
"Above average. Scented, which helps.  :-)  Also, a bit thicker than cheaper bags on the market.",1
"They look great in the tank however, they tore the fins on my betta. I had just gotten him when I put the plants in the tank. After taking the plants out and having them heal up, and then the day after I put them back in he had new spots. :(",0
Works Great!!,1
"Should not be listed as ""puppy chews"" since the fine print says they are not for dogs under 9 months! My older dog is picky and didn't really care for these, but her puppy sister (who should not have actually eaten them) didn't mind them. I guess I'll keep them another 7 months for the pup to grow into them, or give the rest to our neighbors' dogs.",0
Dogs love these.  It's nice to have a treat that is good for cleaning their teech,1
"I have purchased this product many times before. The quality of this product is not as good as it used to be. I can see the difference in my dog's coat and her skin. After she took the omega caps I just purchased, her skin still flakes and her coat is not as healthy looking like she used to after taking the omega caps.",0
"Snake Oil!  Perhaps it has some good for dogs in some unseen way for joints, etc.  I tried the supplement for a month on a 12 year old pup that was suffering from some arthritis.

"My 10 lb dog, ripped this in 2 weeks. The Kong brand is usually very good, not sure why this one is not quality.",0
"Well, our dog broke out of it after the first use. She's a pit and she squeezed out of one of the corners. Judging by the giant gashes she got on her side, it couldn't have been that easy. But I'm still not impressed. Now it sits under our couch, useless. I'm sure I have a very strong and determined dog, so maybe it's just not meant for her kind.",0
"The worst smell ever , it has very bad smell , don't recommond it!",0
Wonderful product. Came quickly and is a great fit for my cat.,1
love it,1
"Great, in theory, but actual pieces of the fleece are coming off almost daily.  I picked up two of these, one for each crate on each floor, and they simply aren't lasting.",0
"Best thing for the lazy cat owner.
I don't want my house to smell like cat poop but I also don't want to scoop turds into baggies and walk them out of the house or to the garbage every time I want to clean the box. So, this allows me to clean the litter box multiple times a day and seal it in the bin until I ready to dump the bag every 7-10 days. Easy to use and easy to manage.",1
Makes grabbing fur a breeze rather it be on the dog or on furniture.,1
This sweater is perfect for the cold Chicago weather we have here and my dog looks so tough in it!,1
"Both cats and dogs love it in my house!  As soon as I pick up the bottle, every animal around wants their treat.  Great stuff!",1
Didn't work for my cat at all.  I so wanted it to work since it was less expensive...,0
My little dogs who cannot walk love to go on walks. Was a great buy.,1
"I just received this collar today and being that I could not wait until Christmas to give it to my dog, I decided to take it out of the package to try it on her. Glad I did.

It did not fit at all. I adjusted the collar as far as it would go to make it shorter, but it only would adjust a few inches of difference. I put it back on my dog, but the size was still waaay too big. So, I measured her neck which she showed to take a size 19 (same as the last time I measured her).

The box of this collar (for size Large) states it is adjustable between size 18 to 27. There is no way to adjust for a length any shorter than 23 Inches!

I am not sure what to rate this collar. It works.. looks great.. but beware of the sizing problem. Due to the electrical unit/cord that runs the length of the collar, it cannot slip through the bucket to shorten beyond the short section which does not have the electrical area.

With that said, Amazon was great! They agreed to refund the collar in full.",1
Dogs just love these. Buy them when ever I can find them.  Lasts for days at a time. Good deal,1
"It amazes me that so many others thought this was a great toothbrush for dogs.  True, there are 3 heads of bristles, but they are all jammed together which makes them more or less useless.  If the bristle heads faced outwards, it would work better.  I was hugely disappointed with this item and would not recommend it.  Better to use a ""people"" toothbrush.",0
"I love this Dog Shampoo. Even though I have a black dog, I still can see a difference after using this product. Her coat has shine to it plus it makes her fur so soft & good smelling. Love this Dog Shampoo.",1
"No reduction in population, in fact, there seems to be an uptick in activity.

UPDATE a return email stated I got a refund coming but that they are surprised as there is THOUSANDS of satisfied customers in the UK. I replied that I followed directions but instead of offering a refund, tell me what to do, or even how long does the treatment take to have a visible effect on the population. I wait for if it works but  if in the normal course of treatment it takes a while, I want that info to be in the next printing of their instruction sheet.",0
"I have purchased two of these retractable leashes. The first one worked great but my dog chewed off the end within a few days. I ordered another exactly the same but it never worked as well as the first one. From day one the clip was hard to open and it never retracted smoothly. Now, less than a month since I received it the button sticks constantly and it barely retracts at all, then all of a sudden it will wind up really fast inside the handle. It's basically useless and I will be purchasing yet another leash. But not this brand for sure. You may get a good one but you may get a dud.",0
Tried the anti itch spray and it did not help my dogs at all.,0
"Way too dry for my old cat, had to add water so he could eat it. He likes the other flavors in this line.",0
"Great bed, but NOT WATERPROOF!
I bought this bed for my 14 year old Dalmatian who is having incontinence issues. After ruining her old bed, I knew I needed something waterproof and easy to wash.
I loved the 2 covers... That made things easier. But after she got really sick this week and put the bed to a real test, the 'waterproof' liner failed miserably and the foam is completely soaked through.
The liner might be water resistant... But it is NOT WATERPROOF!",0
My dog hated them.,0
"Well, maybe I shouldn't be writing this as I haven't used this, but dogs are NEVER suppose to have garlic.  My ex decided that garlic would prevent flea's, ticks, heartworms, etc & killed our dog.  Garlic is a big no, no.",0
works so far,1
This item is rather cheaply made but does the trick. The taller model does not come with enough weatherstrip but I called the telephone number provided and they are supposed to be sending another piece.,1
"My dog likes them ok, but they are maid in China.  God only knows what is in them, but its probably not good.",0
It is not safe or sufficient for an animal that chews or has digging tendencies! It lasted about 45 minutes before we had to remove it for the safety of our baby rabbit. An unfortunate waste of money! :(,0
Thick and greasy! Smells gross and didn't seem to do anything.,0
Love it,1
Cheap belt clip broke first time I tried to put it on,0
"They touched dogs eyeballs. Tried bending them, no good",0
The ball is super hard. It's pretty light weight but the hardness makes me scared to sling it around much afraid to hit my cat in the face.,0
"I was purchasing this product for the 26 foot length of the lead to replace my existing 16 foot lead, also made by flexi.
When it arrived today I discovered that although the package says 26 foot, it is actually only 16 feet. I am returning it today.",0
Cute and squeaky but my little guy wasn't really interested,1
Totally awesome.,1
Great,1
"1. To keep your clippers lubed.
2. Perhaps more importantly, to clean in between the blades. Go to YouTube and watch some videos of pros using oil to clean their clippers, then buy a bottle of this stuff.  Doesn't have to be this brand, it's just what I picked. It does a great job, and I'll buy it again.",1
My chihuahua ripped it within 20 minutes of playing with the toy.  Do not buy.,0
Had issues growing this. Had to return the first one. The second one grew some what but started to die off before I could give it to my cats. I followed the directions exactly but it did not last long. I ended up having to throw it out before I could give it to the cats. I will not get this again.,0
Fast delivery. Product was just as described. I would definitely order again. Thank you!,1
"I have to join the other one star reviewers on this one.  Our Great Dane has a soft mouth and mostly runs around with stuffed toys, but the throat opened up within five minutes with this, Kyjen PP02233 Squeaker Mat Gator 16 Squeaker Plush Squeak.  My husband sewed the neck shut and withing a few minutes our Rat Terrier had the head off and stuffing galore on the floors.",0
"Great product.
I like it, but more important my parrot LOVES it.
Great value for money.
Will purchase again as needed",1
"I thought this was perfect for my min pin, not knowing it comes with a filter. So when I saw the filter I was amazed because i was like wow this is even better until I noticed black stuff leaking from the jug into the consuming part of this product. So I cleaned the entire thing thinking maybe I didn't rinse it enough like the directions said do, only to see the same problem. I discarded the filter and now I'm content.",0
"My kitties like this kind and it keeps the hairballs from ending up on my carpet, bed, etc.  It's the only thing except medicine (which they hate) that I have found to work.",1
Not nearly big enough for a better- double this size would still be iffy at best. Do yourself a favor and get something better for a whole lot less money.,0
"This deep conditioner is the best. I use it on my long haired Maltipoos. After a bath using Happy Tails Bubbles and Beads shampoo and a deep condition using Fur Butter my dogs always come out feeling so very soft and silky. They smell so good for several days too. After their bath and blow dry their ""cuddle factor"" is over the top.
Up date...... Jar of conditioner became all greasy and turned a dark brown. Gross. I contacted rep from Happy Tails and was told that there is only a two year shelf life and to throw it away. She added that the jar that I got was probably old. She did not offer to replace or refund. I see no expire date on label. So there is no way to know how old it is when it is purchased. I will not be buying this product any more.",0
"Wowwww! Just wowwwww! FANTASTIC packaging! Arrived way earlier than expected! Got 10 healthy, active, alive shrimps! Plus, I also spotted a little baby! Buying some more in the future!",1
"Not sure why any one would like these so much. I agree with those who point out there is a MAJOR design flaw.  because the strap connects at the bottom front (against your back) , the back of the carrier sags significantly and drags the upper strap back with the sagging. This then is uncomfortable both for the animal and for the human.  I am under the impression that IF the strap were connected toward the back of the carrier instead of directly to the front edge,  it MIGHT work much  better.  We bought two of these and they are essentially unusable the way they are.  It seems obvious that the manufacturer did not try these before sending them to production.",0
"This work so well in slowing down my new puppy's fast eating.  Works great, fast shipping.",1
"Our kittens love EVERY toy except this one. They don't give it the time of day, even if you playfully drag it around. I don't know why they hate it, but I would not buy it again.",0
Arrived fast and cat loves playing with it!,1
My dogs really loves these steps. I was trying to find steps that were a little higher for my bed and these did the trick.  They were hesitant for a few days but now they have no problems using them,1
This multimedia reactor seems high quality for the price IMO and is silent as well.  Installed in my sump.,1
Doesn't fit.  Nonsense,0
"The bowls are much smaller than expected, they fall off the cage every time my dog walks in or out and the part that holds the bowl completely broke off the part that attaches to the cage within 2 weeks.",0
"This is for LARGE dogs.  I ordered this size for my aussie but ends up fitting my Newfoundlands, who don't need one for anything at this time but I will hang on to it for the future.",1
My cats love it!,1
Does not work,0
I love having a variety of treats for my pooch. These are a very clean treat as my 16 yr old cockapoo is on a raw diet. I also like that they are a soft treat for his aging teeth. They come in a 4 pack and are delivered very quickly. Maestro makes sure we never run out of his treats!,1
"Great, healing probiotic for my dog as he has digestive issues.",1
"The front strap was bigger than I needed, but I was able to overlap the velcro and make it work. The top loop seems to have a good deal of control for a harness which is nice. Overall built tough and happy with how its working",1
Beautifully made!,1
"This collar serves its purpose.  It is rugged enough, and the lights are bright enough to be seen.  It looks much better in the pictures though. The lights will become skewed to one side or the other as you adjust the fit.  My dog is smaller, and the collar looks large and clunky even though it says it is for a small dog.  I won't return the item because it works and I will use it occasionally.  Ultimately I'm disappointed it didn't match my expectations.",0
"Have used this about a week.  Seems well made, relatively light (compared to chain) for my 50# boxer to drag around and doesn't tangle (as rope & chain tends to).  No problems that I've seen.",1
"We got this because my dog had horrible breath! Well we gave him some last night and this morning he had 4 sezuires! I would never recommend this to anyone. We took him to a vet and it cost us over 300. Never again! Please, for the safety of your animals, do not buy this product.",0
Product came leaking all over the place!! Yikes,0
Keeps the pups busy!,1
"Very small and flimsy, but maybe it could work for a small bird cage",0
Can not get the remote to charge everything else charges when I charge the remote the red light never goes off I unplug it and it doesn't work,0
Great size for my cat. I love that the top opens and is also screened so you can see in the top or front. Great find,1
horrible light.  Works when it wants.  Never stays on.  Not very bright.,0
My Pit Bull's favorite toy!!,1
"When mine arrived 10 days ago, I was in love! But after using it TWICE for about an hour each time, the seems are already coming apart and there is a hole in the bottom. There are other versions on amazon that cost less and I have had for two years going and they are still going strong. I'm so sad this one already broke.",0
"The purple scarves are OK, in their color.  High quality fabric, as usual, but I think it would be better to buy a 50 cent one from China, because this one is not such-a-much.  I am way beyond disappointment, here.  The pattern also could be way better and more paisley.  Avoid it.  It is better than their black, or their turquoise. Never try their yellow.  Even so, this is not worth buying, as are the other Carolina Scarves.. The paisley is blah. so why have it and why buy it?  Until they completely re-make this, stay away.",0
"Great pump so far. Had it running for 3 days now in a 5 gal Betta tank and it works as advertised. Can't hear that it is running and by restricting the air flow, I get exactly the tiny bubbles I want.
I would buy it again in a heart beat, especially because there is literally zero noise.",1
"Flap is heavy for cat to push the flap out or in. The flap is hard,
that makes cat reluctant to use.
Also company is not ready to offer refund and even Amazon
provides return the buyer needs to pay for return.
If there is option of -1 rate that would be the rate from me.
At the end just to say the quality in whole is very poor for that money.",0
My dog loved it so much that he destroyed it in a few days of him getting it. Has a lot of stuffing in the top head part. If you have a power chewer they will pop it.,1
Missing half the pieces and the pieces it does have are very poor quality.,0
A must for nervous cats.,1
My cat wouldn't eat it so I had to give it to a neighbor whose cat 'eats anything'. OH well,0
Well received Thank,1
These have been a life saver. Our dogs were marking in the house. We were at our wits end. They are large dogs so kennels would cost a fortune and I did not want them locked up all day. They do not mark with their wraps and do not mind wearing them!,1
"Worked great, and looks nice too!",1
"This was the smallest size I saw at the pet shop but over 4x the price. This collapsible cage arrived, easy to assemble, and strong enough to last for the amount of time it's needed. It's been so great and for the price it doesn't get any better!",1
"I think these clippers do a pretty good job when they are plugged in, but when they are unplugged, you can hear the power dim down. I am not sure if I just received a bad battery, but in the end, all NiMH and NiCad batteries will lose their power and ability to hold a charge. I hope they release a Lith. version of this clipper.

Update 8/28/13

I have decided to drop my rating to two stars since the unit died on me in less than a year (I ended up pulling out the old pair of clippers I had that I purchased at Walmart for $30). I purchased the Wahl clipper oil, and I clean and oil my clippers after every use. I am not sure what kind of battery is inside this unit, but I really think they should upgrade this product with a lithium version. NiCad and NiMH batteries are extremely out of date, and their performance is extremely poor compared to lithium batteries.",0
Didn't improve my dog's itchiness.,0
"It's simple, and it works.  I've been using it for about a week now.  It would have been nicer to have an indiglo backlight, and a velcro strip, but I'm happy.  I'll probably buy another one soon.",1
Very large my dog was happy,1
"Lady at the local pet shop recommended this for our 11-lb cats, who are very fluffy and take up a lot of space.  I bought it because I needed to get one to the vet today.

Picked it up by the handle, walked outside, wham!  The handle broke off, and the carrier containing my already-stressed cat fell down and bounced on the driveway.

I'm taking it back tomorrow and making certain to buy a different brand.",0
"I thought this was working great, my problem couldve just been with the type of cat litter I was using, however my cat likes to drink the ocean and of course it all goes through her. The wet litter goes through both layers, clumps up and gets them stuck together, so Im stuck using a scooper regardless. I kind of already threw this box away, but may be purchasing it again to try out the results with different litter... Maybe.",0
My little kitten seems to love this and it fits him perfectly.,1
"This is the first review I've written on Amazon because I felt compelled to relate my experience with this product.  I went straight to the super-feed.com website and ordered the combo deal #20 for $161.24, shipped.  I received the item promptly and had it set up in about 30 minutes.  Later, I bought < $3 in hardware and built my own stand.  Some kind of stand is highly recommended.  I loaded the hopper with Iams Weight Control cat food and programmed the digital timer.  Iams cat food seems to be the perfect size and shape for the unit.  It has worked flawlessly for a solid week.  I did not purchase the guard that fits over the dispenser, and my cat has not figured out how to steal from it yet.  If she does, I'll just buy the shield.  Already I've noticed my cat does not yell for her food in the morning and evening.  She still comes around and makes a few polite inquiries just before meal time, but she is getting the idea that I no longer control when she gets fed.  It's been great for our relationship.  Now I can also leave town for long weekends without worrying about her.  This is simply the perfect product for my needs!

UPDATE: Almost three years later and NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!  Still love it!",1
amazing price for a very good heater!,1
"If I could give it zero stars, I would.  I like grain-free food for my 3 cats, and thought I'd try this one because it had healthy ingredients and good reviews.  My not-picky cats wouldn't finish the first few pieces I put out for them yesterday, and that NEVER happens with these 3, especially the chunky Siamese who acts like she's starving.  When I offered it to them later yesterday and again today, they each ate a few pieces and walked away.  One of my cats threw up right after he walked away.  That never happens with the other grain-free foods I've had for them.  I've already asked for a refund for this.",0
"I used this product on my indoor cat, as well as my outdoor cats.  This product didn't work on either.  I followed the instructions, rubbing and massaging the product into their fur (they are all short hair cats too), and the fleas didn't diminish in the least.  I also do not like this product because when you sprinkle it on your pets, a cloud of dust flies upward.  I had to wear a mask in order to apply this product on my pets, and even so the dust still flew into my face and clogged up my lungs immediately.  Mind you, when this happened I was indoors and there was no wind to blame for this.  I don't recommend this at all.",0
The cover ripped on the seam.  Ordered replacement  cover it is bigger then bed.,0
Good product - fast delivery!,1
"I actually cancelled another tree I had ordered when I saw the color of the gray colored cat tree!  I had just bought new furniture, and this gray cat tree would look perfect behind my new couch.!  I cried when I opened the box and pulled out a beige cat tree...does not match at ALL.NOT at all like the photos online.  BIG disappointment. But. as I am elderly I cannot get the darn thing back into the box!",0
"I bought this collar for my cat, since he's been having a flee/worm problem and other spot products have not worked so far.  After about a week, thankfully while in my room (since he's an indoor/outdoor cat), he managed to loosen the collar and slip it into his mouth, so that his jaw was caught and he couldn't get it off.  I eventually needed to cut it off of him.  The safety mechanism DID NOT work and we're extremely lucky it didn't happen while he was outside, where he could choke or run into traffic!",0
I bought this to replace a similar type of brush for my long haired cat.  I love the design of this type of brush because it is easy to remove the hair.  This one's better than the previous one.  The bristles completely retract and allow every piece of hair to be removed.,1
"I like the first-rate quality of the beds. I have often spent twice as much at
the big name dog suppliers but have just as often been disappointed
by the quality; absolutely none of the previous beds had a cover
that fit easily. It was always necessary to tug and pull and strain the zipper.
Thank you also for such speedy delivery. Please sign me a Very Satisfied Customer.",1
Had a plastic one and our dog could tear it up.  This is fantastic.  Easy to clean and non chewable.,1
"These collars are a good fit, well made, and am looking forward to trying them in the dark",1
"Apparently it runs small and is made of a strange, light-weight material that feels cheap and flimsy.  Try another one.",0
"This is a increadible fish tank that is absolutely gorgeous. It's just the right size for my beta fish, and he loves the extra space. Yes, the filter/light unit can have problems, but the customer service is great. The light on mine stopped working in the first two weeks. I called Hagen customer service, and they sent a brand new filter unit with 2 day shipping- super fast. I have not had any more problems. This tank is great, and the customer service is even better.",1
"I mean this thing is like the size of a piece of paper and I still have cat litter evvvvvery where! Unless you have a tiny box for your midget cat then keep it moving right past this mat, ya know kind like all my litter does.",0
I only used them for 1 day.  After that I left them off the feeder.  I couldn't see any reason to use them.  The design of the Humm Zinger feeder is enough to discourage bees.,0
Works great in our garage for our outside cats.,1
"Love this product..it is sooo cute..it is VERY important that you measure fido, this is crucial in getting the right size for your pooch. 7XL(neck 21.6, back=25.6, girth=33.4) is what i got for my princess...my little angel's measurements are as follows, this is just to give u an idea..neck=19 back=25 girth=30...",1
My dog broke the voice box on this toy within minutes :(,0
"I got this because I thought my dog would like it better since it claimed to be bacon flavored. He really liked the original one, so I thought might as well try it. But there was not the slightest scent of bacon. My dog chewed it once or twice, and is not interested in it anymore. Not very happy.",0
"My dogs didn't like them, went back to other brand we were using.",0
I don't know if it was my dog or it just being poor quality but it opened up three times while my dog was playing with it. I eventually dumped the remaining after the third time and put it in the non working toys drawer. My dog is small and gentle with toys so I think it was a defect with the actual toy.,0
"So I have an 8 month old Walker/Curt mixed puppy. Basically a horse, no big deal. He. Chews. EVERYTHING. & he can chew through some pretty tough stuff. Metal bowls, heaters, & wicker baskets just to make a few. We have had this toy 2 months! He is just now starting to make any progress chewing it. We play with this toy daily. I leave it in his kennel. He chews it everyday. This toy has been such a good toy for us. Will be purchasing again as soon as this one is destroyed",1
didn't work at all!,0
Dogs love these.  Good size.,1
I purchased this as combo that you suggested and it is not even the correct battery for the bark collar I purchased. I knew There was a reason I have never purchased item you recommend to buy with items purchased.,0
"Be sure this fits your LitterMaid model.  This one didn't fit my model and the seller, Ablackhorse, refused to take a return even though it was totally uniopened.  $40 bucks down the drain!  Do not by from them!!

Great chew toy for pups,1
The Moda Summer Breeze III fabric were great.,1
This fits the wald 157 basket I bought to put on my bike. It is a little thin for my purposes but adding a thin blanket on top of this will make it quite comfortable for my dog. All the other dog beds I looked at were too thick and I did not feel safe putting my dog in the basket while riding. She likes to stand up in the basket and this amount of thickness allows her to do that and not tip out. (She does wear a harness attached to the basket.),1
"This is advertised as having a 'squeaker'.  They lie.  It never squeaked at all.  My one dog had it ripped to shreds in a few minutes.  As I type this (just got it a few hours ago), it is unrecognizable in its original form.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",0
Most of the batteries are dead  You get what you pay for,0
We love the litter locker and the refills! We have had up to 3 cats at one time and it REALLY helps with odor control and cleanliness.,1
It is always getting stopped up. Even worse when you use the filter. I did not realize this until I saw one of my dogs licking the empty bowl with a tank still half full. I had to jiggle and twist the tank to get it going.  Since I live in a dry climate this is not something I would risk counting on to supply my dogs water. I keep another bowl beside it so when it fails they have a bowl also.,0
The Zoo Med Avian Sun 5.0 Compact Florescent Bulb was defective when I received it but Amazon was quick and professional with the return and refund. I was pleased with Amazon but obviously not with the bulb.,0
"Balls destroyed in 3 days, one only lasted 1 hour",0
"I love this crate.  It is light, easy to assemble.  Perfect fit for my Labradoodle.",1
"I bought this because the majority of reviews are positive.  HOWEVER, this is nasty cheap plastic that has an enduring strange chemical smell that barely dissipates even when soaked in soapy water overnight. I will not give this to my dog to play with and chew.  It is shipped from China and takes a long time to arrive, unlike most other Amazon Prime products.  The ball came with a strange little sticker that says, ""take me away plz"" that I find creepy.",0
Make sure you read the size correctly and don't go by the picture. The large is 10 inches and would not fit the dog in the picture. You have to pay for return shipping too.,0
"This carrier is cool and functional enough that the staff at the vet's office comment on it every time.  The top comes off easily with the side clips, which is handy if your pet is anxious, has mobility issues or is wearing the ""cone of shame.""  I bought the fleece bed to go inside, and my kitty actually selects to sleep in the carrier by choice.  If I leave the top off she will treat it as a bed.  My friends got the larger size for their two kittens (to carry both at once) and also love it.  Their kitties sleep inside by choice as well.  I don't know how I would make this product is better.",1
Way overpriced for package size. Same price as 11 lbs package.,0
"Horrible product. It worked great out of the package. The first time our dog wore the collar the ring connecting it to his leash came right off. Our dog went running down the street before we knew it happened. When we removed the collar that same day, only a tiny piece of the light was still working. Very disappointed!",0
Master two months before ripping,0
I use this for my 2 dogs that are terrified of storms. Works great and best of all does not make the groggy or sleepy,1
"Poor quality, offered no protection to animal, bottom panel would not fit into slots, very unstable.",0
"my cats love this bed, i got it for the barn cat, we already had three beds but rescued a new barn cat and he needed a bed.  outstanding.",1
"I heard the glass moving before I had even opened the package. When I opened it, I was consumed in a cloud of powdered glass and surrounded by shards of glass in all sizes. The top itself is great, works like a charm. The packaging: a cardboard box around another cardboard box containing the glass top, is simply inadequate to harbor such a fragile load. Plus, I found top at my local Petco, it was only 40ish. On this website it is 60 ish!! Lesson learned, get off your butt and GO TO THE STORE.",0
I was skeptical of this working as stated but my dog only minded have this on initially and now doesn't seemed to be bothered by it much at all. It's stopped him from licking a wound for the past week and now the wound is looking all better.  I recommend this product especially over the hard plastic cones.,1
"Didn't work, plus are too hard when they are supposed to be soft.",0
"i'm here out of frustration with the dust this litter produces..
i'm thinking of making a video review of what I have to do with this litter.. i'm not the one that bought the litter so i have to deal with it until i can convince them not to buy it  (but outside of the dust it's better than arm & hammer ultra which smells chemical, and then just smells period because baking soda doesn't block cat smells, sorry a&m but it doesn't)..  but I literally take the new litter outside, not just outside, but to the near front of my driveway.. and then i proceed to pour the litter out of its bag into a bucket.... 'from 4 feet in the air'.. this dissipates the dust..no really i swear it does.. kind of..  i look like i'm pouring flour into the buckets.. and this litter has a smell that sticks to your nose so i try to make sure the wind is going the other way.. but i go bucket to bucket about 10 times.. it's funny while you stand there your mind tries to reason just how much dust can come out of this litter.. so after 10 or so buckets of conceding defeat to the remaining dust, eventually you just pour it in the litter pan and then it goes into the house..  now 4 days later, every time i go to scoop the litter pan, a cloud of dust comes up at me.. and this stuff covers everything that is near the litter pan in our kitchen.. canned goods etc..  it's the dustiest litter i've ever used, and believe me i'm a darned connoisseur of litter..  the best kind we've used is the Tidy Cats scoopable in the yellow bucket with the red lid.. though sometimes it can have a bleach smell at first, but not often..  but the overall best litter i have ever used came to me in a product test where the company sent me some to try.. i have no idea what is the brand, but it was made from walnut shells.. i kid you not.. it was virtually dust free and it retained a fresh smell (or should i say, little to no smell.. if anything it smells more fresh to nature up close than chemical like most litters now) for the entire time I used it.. and those that have cats know it's a miracle if a product can block the smell of their litter..  it usually has to be enzyme based or forget it.. but walnuts kept the smell away.. and it clumped well...  i didn't have to empty the box with a significant amount of usable litter like most times because it just gets a bad smell and you have to change it.. the walnut type was good to the end..  so i'm on the hunt for something like that..

but this fresh step litter is just dust heaven.. use it once and you'll see what i mean.. clumps well but the dust isn't worth it..

but if you're looking for a good litter, look for one that is made from walnut shells.",0
Great product,1
"For the price...they are fine.
Slightly smaller than I was expecting, more wide than deep. Which makes mixing anything into my dogs 2 cups of kibble a bit more of a chore than it needs to be.
Also one of the rubber rings around the base came broken, not a deal breaker but now I do find the bowl in different locations when I come home eat day. The dogs have figured out the bowls weakness and now exploit it whenever they get a chance. :/",0
"I bought this bag just to try something different after my Premier bag broke. I really liked the premier bag and I like this one even better. The inner pocket is nice and big with two separate areas for different kinds of treats. I like the belt with the snaps and it is easy to adjust. The metal closure is really superior on this bag and looks like it will hold up for quite awhile. Like other reviewers, I do find the little mesh outer pocket to be fairly useless. If the manufacturer would improve on that, they would have a perfect training bag. All in all, I am very happy with it and hope that it will last.",1
"The cat consensus is unanimous:  flavorful, chewy, enjoyable treats.  The only drawback is that they dry out VERY fast.  The ziplock doesn't keep out air entirely.  No problem, though.  I triple-locked the treats (ziplock on product, inside a big ziplock bag, packed in a plastic container with a rubber seal.  This may seem like a lot of bother, but if your cat prefers chewy to crunchy, it takes only an extra minute to take precautions and it save money - you don't have to throw away treats because they are too dry for your kitty.",1
This is a life saver. I hate how loud all the tags on my dogs collar are but with this he is so quite. We can even wallk past other dogs without them knowing and barking. Will buy again.,1
Not for truly powerful chewers.  Toy was destroyed in 10 minutes.  What an expensive treat.  Expected more from a Kong product.,0
This was great for me when i got my second dog since i already had one for my first dog.  I have had the first one for about 2 years and is still going strong.  I will definitely buy PetSafe collars again.,1
This collar does not have a buckle which I did not notice at first so you have to slip it over the dogs head. It's not that big of a deal but can be annoying.,0
Not at all what we were expecting,0
"Leash worked well for a month and a half. Then started to fray at multiple locations. Finally, my dog (45 lbs) broke the leash from a sudden jerk.",0
"way over priced, found at other store for under 3.00 . too late to return.",0
"dogs love them, good price",1
"My dog  loves her Greenies, and they were delivered a day ahead of schedule!",1
"Just what I wanted, very fast delivery!",1
This Cat Litter Trapper lives up to its name.  Have only found a granule or two on the floor.  We liked it so much we ordered a second one so that when we need to rinse one off we have a back up.  Would like to suggest a larger one that litter box could sit on and surround it.  The trapper is made of quality material and is a pleasing addition to the cat space.  Great product!,1
The ultra sonic was nice but our dog had it totally tore apart with in 30 minutes,0
Update:  Our cat had the collar on for only two days and the reflective strip is cracking and peeling off.  Not happy with this overpriced cheap piece of junk.,0
"Cheap, didn't work, directions didn't make sense. Don't waste your money",0
"Not worth the cost if your cat is adventurous. I think this worked for half a night with my cat. He tipped the whole thing over several times. I was so hoping this would work instead of filling a bowl up everyday, but this didn't work for my cat. Plus the metal gets crusty and dirty quickly.

Not worth it for the price. Hoping to try again when my cat gets older, and maybe he won't be as curious.",0
easy to apply - love them!,1
Lasted less than a week before i had to throw it away.,0
"This is not shampoo, it is only a 1 ounce container of Goodwinol ointment, and it does not cure mange, which is a very broad term for dogs, as well as cats. I ordered this product 3 times, and each order was a 1 OUNCE container. Buy the 1lb jar for about $38, if your animal has a non-bacterial skin condition, or do as I did and go to your vet for an antibiotic.",0
I bought this for my younger cats and they were covered in fleas again 3 days later.  They are inside cats.  I will be trying a different brand next time.,0
"The wooden shapes were great looking, but they were huge. My conure cannot pick a single one up to play with it. I got mainly the same couple pieces.
Maybe I read the packaging wrong or something, but was hoping for it to be okay for my conure to play with. Oh well.",0
"I have not purchased this cage, but please don't think I'm being prejudiced. This cage is waaaaay to small for even a dwarf hamster! The min. size cage for any hamster is 360 square inches, and this is far from ok for a gerbil! please, be responsible and get a proper sized cage for your pet. They will appreciate it, trust me! Don't buy this cage!!!!!",0
"These actually do not help them. Because my dog still toots anyway. But I did notice that when she goes to poop it doesn't smell as bad. So it helps for something, but not so much for gas.",0
"Easily the best litter scoop I have ever used. It picks up small used litter clumps that used to get left behind when I used my other scoop. I believe it helps make my litter last longer. The plastic is durable and the bright colors are lovely. I enjoyed it so much that I bought one for a friend who is now buying one for her sister.

UPDATE 5/15/18
It has been a few years and I finally had a scoop break. This was not a problem or flaw in the construction, it had just been a hardworking tool in a house with three cats. I immediately replaced it and I am still happily using this scoop and I plan on buying one for another friend who recently adopted a cat.",1
It is a great food for cats like mine who can't tolerate fowl. High protein. No allergies for her.,1
This is a quality self stuff dog bed. We pack it with old pillows and it fits our English Mastiff perfectly. All seams and zippers are holding up really well after months of Big dog use.,1
"My 3 mos old GSP wouldn't eat them, just spits them out right away. Normally he is happy with pretty much everything including cucumbers and cat poop. Something wrong with my dog.... or with these treats",0
"I had a heavier duty ramp but it was getting to be difficult for me to use and I was always in danger of destroying someting with it. This one is very light and easy to use, and takes up less space in my car. I am using it with my 12 year old 70 lb fake Australian Shepherd. I had to teach him to slow down and be more careful, but he has adjusted to the smaller ramp, although I always closely supervise him when he is using it and occasionally give him an assist.",1
What can you say about poo bags. They keep your hands from touching it,1
don't wasted your money on it useless....,0
I ordered two extra long antlers the description says a generous 7-9 inches I received one at four and a half inches and one at five and a half inches inches. I cannot attest to the Quality yet,0
Birds love this toy,1
"These do not fit all can types. I got these specifically looking for the ones that fit the smaller cat food cans, AND the larger cans. These don't--are only for larger cans.",0
Great price. Thick material and easy to clean.,1
I love that my dog does not have to bend his neck over as far to eat and drink. He has stopped gagging on his food and water. This is easy to clean- I just place it in the dishwasher every once in awhile. It's also very flattering in our kitchen,1
It did not get rid of fleas and one cat even had a reaction to it. Get it from a store or online with a vet.,0
My cat hates this thing.,0
"High quality, but make sure you mix it with a seed mix bc hamsters need variety. I recommend Carefresh Complete for dwarfs and Hazel Hamster(Harry Hamster in the UK) for Syrians.",1
"Barely any 'Raw' bites! :( What a rip off! I would say, not even a 1/2 a cup for the entire 10lb bag! Unacceptable!",0
Fits pony well and stays on.  Appears comfortable as she doesn't seem to mind it.,1
too big for dog I measured it for but well built and sturdy,1
Did not work for me although I was using outdoors. It actually made my puppy more attacted to the cable because of the smell.,0
Bought three of these. Just got around to trying them out. One of them had the charging port break rifht off the bat. Not very happy. So far other two are working.,0
"This product works well however the one I received completely broke the very first time I used it, pretty ridiculous.",0
This is the one you want its a real coat not a decoration dog appears to be happy with it too.,1
received as described and in good condition,1
Somewhat easy to put together directions. Love the color. Love the height and so do my cats.,1
"This is by far one of my favorite Amazon purchases. Not only does my dog love it, but it's a great nutritional supplement. I can't see the great things it's probably doing for her insides, but i can see how much shinier and healthier her coat looks! She's softer too! If that's any indication of the support it is giving to her body systems, then I have nothing to worry about.  She is still full of energy, all of her blood tests are normal, and she has had no illnesses. I also like the no-spill packaging, and the heavier duty pump that's on the newer bottles. No complaints here. Thanks so much!!",1
"Why is it that I'm finding the same exact comments on the same coop under a different coop name? BECAUSE THEY ARE FAKE REVIEWS!
I can't believe these great 5 star comments are actually from customers and not from staff members. The coop is so small my chickens cry when they see me. Their heads hit the roof when in the outdoor run, plus it's so small there is no way four chickens can walk freely without running into each other. It's truly animal cruelty! The sleeping area has a small perch for two chickens. So where do the other two sleep?
My friend purchased this and immediately painted it so I didn't get to see it before it was painted. I would have told him to send it back had I seen how flimsy it is. It WILL fall over in a wind. If an animal tries to climb on it, it will topple and kill your chickens. The materials used are junk! The lock broke in half when I tried to open a door. The hinges for the ladder are way too small and will break when you move the coop. The ladder runs into a wall. Don't waste your money on this crap. You will not have happy chickens. You can hire someone to build a better coop from scratch for a lot less.",0
I had purchased these from a pet store for more money. I decided to search for them online to find a better price because after using this product I will continue purchasing them. They work great. I had a dog pee problem odor and couldn't get rid of the smell after using several other products to clean up the area. But after using this we no longer have a problem. It completely absorbed any and all bad odors.,1
"It was supposed to be 10 inches long----if it was 5 inches, I'd be stretching it.  Nothing any different than what you could buy at a grocery store.  I thought it'd be something like a kicker that my cat's had before and liked, but it was nothing like that.  False advertising on length.",0
Dog destroyed in less than 12 hours. Even the rope inside. I hope I get my money back,0
"This stuff is kitty cat crack. At the bargain price of about $120 per pound, it's cheaper than people crack.",1
My English shepherd loves it even though it smells like fish flakes and it's probably 3xs the price of regular dog food.,1
Netting & fabric came a part (where connected) after first use. Aussie was just leaning against it not trying to get out. Waste of money.,0
She goes to sleep as soon as she gets in. It is such a perfect fit!!!,1
Great to have when taking my dog in stores,1
"Has absolutely no effect, at all. I've tried several distances, at all settings. Several different sized dogs, and absolutely no discernible effect.",0
"What's not apparent until it's installed is that the dark brown border (which seems darker and wider than shown in the picture) is suddenly a part of my living room wall and worse, the slide-in closure partition (not pictured anywhere) is that same brown color so when it's closed, I have two unwelcome and unexpected brown eyesores on my pale cream wall.  Also, I have no idea why it is described as aluminum as the frame, ""tunnel"" and door are all plastic.  What caught my eye was the word ""aluminum"" as I thought the slide down closure would be aluminum as a previous patio door panel's slide down closure had been.  It was too late to not install it and return it as there was a gaping hole in the wall and I couldn't exactly go back and fill in the hole again and search for a different door!  I paid my handyman to put it in and it's not the kind of thing that can be easily switched out.  Disappointing to say the least.",0
"A terrifically helpful product.  The downside is that you must remove the converter in order to use the shower.  Because we are using this in a spare bathroom to rinse our muddy dog and don't need the shower otherwise it has not proved problematic, but if this were an actively used shower I would advise against this particular model.",1
"Used with the conditioner and MIU brush. My pup is a german shepherd - golden mix and has a lot of hair, and this helps keep her shedding to a minimum!",1
Used to keep my large rabbits cool during the summer. Was expecting for it to be bigger. Couldn't even fit half of a rabbit on there!,0
Love these. I have gotten 3.  My dogs seem comfortable in them,1
My baby loves these treats.....I believe they are very healthy for my dog  Thank You!!!,1
"don't understand how there are any positive reviews for this toy... it may as well be made for dogs with no teeth! our 4mo australian cattle dog destroyed this in less than 6 hours. first the squeakies went, then the tail, then the whole thing was shredded. what a waste of money.",0
Just the right size for small dogs,1
"I use this tablet for my cat who has arthritis in his hips . Since I have been giving it to him everyday for a couple of months , he has greatly improved. He seems to be pain free , as he is much more like his old self again. He is 14 yrs. old",1
"I really love this door for my dogs, they are able to go in and out whenever they want. I didn't install it permanently, because otherwise I can't take bigger items in and out of my sliding door. But that works for us, I didn't want to leave it in at night, the spring loaded top makes a quick and easy fit. I did have to buy additional weather stripping to control cool/hot air from getting in the house.",1
"I have always fed my cats dry food, never wet food, well now that I'm a little older and I can afford to buy them wet food as a treat, I had been feeding them canned food for about a year, before I started to feed them the canned food one of my cats had his blood tested because of his age, everything was good he was healthy. I had to take him in for an infection he has in his eye the vet said we should do another blood test to see where he's ""at"". Now all of a sudden he has Thyroid Problems, the vet said that it may have been because of the lining these cans have to preserve the food inside of them. That may have caused the Thyroid problems. I will never give my babies canned food. I have switched them to the pouched food, or the frozen food in plastic they sell at Whole Foods. Here is the website I found information on Thyroid Problems for Cats. [...]
Simon is an old man, almost 20, so I understand it was inevidable, but not something that was caused by me. I feel so bad, I love my baby. Thanks for reading.",0
This is the same as the first one doesn't work my little ones keep on barking I was looking for one that when they start barking the noise will make them stop and stay quiet. Do not buy it,0
It didn't work for my purposes... kitty is still going outside the box but it was worth a try!  I love the Precious Cat litter :),0
Smells great but completely ineffective...,0
"On edit, I ordered the large for her to try since we were uncertain that the medium was really what she needed.  She weighs 15 pounds and the large swamped her.  So I put the medium back on her.
I have been waiting to write a review about this harness.  We have had it now for a couple of months and I will have to say, it is very sturdy for my Puggle.  She is a small Puggle and the medium fits her fine.  I still wish the buckle was located in a different location as other reviewers have said.  She seems to love it and does not like it when I take it off of her.  I have washed it on a gentle cycle in a laundry bag in my washer and it looked brand new when done.",1
"Purchased here from Amazon with prime shipping. I cannot recommend this item. I prefer this style of scooper, but the scoop piece handle broke in half about two months after purchase. A waste of time and money.",0
"Our dog loves this bed and we've bought it twice because it's perfect. Beware: after about 5-6 months you will be picking up an unlimited supply of cotton puffs from around your house every day, forever.",1
"Mine arrived like the ones I see pictured, black and dead.",0
Same as I use already.,1
fits smaller than expected.,0
dog loves this and free shipping,1
Very cheap material. Returned it.,0
says washable.  The 2nd washing the material literally appeared eaten away leaving a huge hole with all the stuffing coming out.  washed cold.  dried delicate. the outer shell is a plastic type material.,0
Made my dog throw up. I think she may be allergic to glycerin.,0
"Measurements for this item are way off. This should be considered a Small.  Medium will not fit a dog that is sixteen inches long.  As it is a non-returnable item, I will have to sell it myself on craigslist. Won't buy from this vendor due to inaccurate sizing.",0
"My birds love it--especially  the red bellied woodpeckers.  I put it out all year and especially like the ""no melt"" feature in the summers.  One cake lasts only a few days no matter what season I use it.  I store these in the freezer so that it isn't so messy to unwrap and put in the feeder.  I use a cage feeder that's a box in a box so that squirrels and large birds cannot have access to the suet.  I have been feeding birds for many years and have found this suet to be consistently good.",1
"This is just what i needed for my poor miserable cat.  Yes it is a little spendy, but with no grain its worth it, amd my picky cat will eat it.  It was shipped fast.",1
Loving their new swing.,1
"Updating my review....

After a couple months the log no longer floats and sank to the floor.  Appears the paint is coming off the log.",0
None of my dogs like this sprayed in there mouths.  Not sure how well it works cause it's hard to get sprayed on there teeth.,0
Came with a dead battery and my dog wants nothing to do with walks right past it.,0
Good value for the price. Arrived when expected. Make sure you measure correctly so it will fit your precious one.,1
smallest large i have ever seen.,0
Sure enough - it works.,1
Almost no meat on the bones when they arrived so dogs had no interest in the bones compared to others.,0
My dog loves these!,1
My cats are 12 and I think this food helps them move better. I wanted to feed them healthy food since they are older. I have only been feeding them this brand for a couple months and they love it.,1
works as advertised. Good purchase and concerned company followup,1
Dog got out first day we tried it,0
"LOVE this a second time around!  I owned the first generation baby biorb and it finally started leaking about two weeks ago - and I had to think about another aquarium for my betta Fred who has been thriving in the baby biorb.  It's so easy, keeps the temp constant with my small heater and its easy easy to clean.  I modified it a bit to keep the bubbles at bay and it just works great.  that said, it started leaking... ugh a slow leak and I started research other small 3-4 gallon tanks.... and I came back to the baby biorb!  I am so glad I did!  They totally upgraded the light (it is now totally automatic - it changes from light to dark based on the light in room) and the inside of the tank is a bit easier to deal with (the space where you put the rocks and the filter is more defined - makes it easier to clean).  Anyways, it is also just gorgeous - did I mention that?  It looks great on my entry table coming into house - Fred seems to enjoy it, his silk like plans and log look fantastic in the biorb and it is just plain easy to manage.  I am so glad I came back to this.  I was thinking of another fluval chi - that I also have for my 2 female bettas - also lovely tank but not as easy to clean, manage and not as ideal for bettas as the biorb.  The price is right!  When I bought this about 6 years ago it was well over $150 plus all the stuff - now this upgraded tank with the moonlight light -is around $60!  It almost makes me want to get another betta!!!!  You do need a heater - and a betta floating log (because they will be so happy) and you are set!",1
"Maybe the dimensions were provided somewhere; regardless by ""Large"" I expected, well large. These are tiny, no bigger than 4"".",0
I have 2 Aussie's and they managed to rip the tree part within a couple of hours. The squirrels are holding up so far but I don't give them much more time.  I purchased the extra large and I thought it was still too small which turned out to be a blessing. Less stuffing to pick up. Too expensive for something that didn't even make it through a half a day.,0
ORDERED 2 OF THESE ONE WORKED WONDERFULLY BUT THE OTHER APPEARED TO BE BROKEN.. NOT SURE WHY. ID LIKE A REFUND OF THE BROKEN ONE -- IT WAS NEVER USED EITHER.,0
A new favorite for my grandpuppy!!,1
does not work on my animals.,0
considerably smaller than made out to be. smaller of the two chew toys is about 2 inches long.,0
"MY dog is a little 15 pound dog, when I received the item he loved it, but within 10 minutes of chewing on the toy, the entire rope was unraveling. Such a waste of money!!",0
Works great smells fresh,1
"Smells good, label pic is accurate, Baby Meow does not like it.",1
"Marineland sent me an obviously used, broken light!!!!

The LED module had scaling on it like it had been installed before, and it didn't work.  The plastic lens that installs in the hood was fogged and cracked.  Someone purchased this hood before me, substituted in a broken used LED module and plastic lens, and returned it to Marineland, and they in turn sold it to me.

I would expect a rip-off like this from some reseller, but not from Marineland direct.

Looks like my kid's fish tank will be dark for a few days while I figure out a replacement solution.",0
We ordered these but received chews for small DOGS ONLY.,0
Ineffective for my kitten.,0
Dog demolished it,0
I have four cats. Two older and two 3 yr olds. Not one of them will eat this food. I wanted to give them a better quality food so I slowly added this to their bowl of Meow Mix tender centers. Well they ate all the Meow Mix and left the Taste of the Wild in the bowls. I tried to mix the two for the past month but have given up.,0
My Lab bit the chunk of it in one minute,0
works great,1
"I ordered this toy for my two cats -- received one toy (the pink bunny) but actually thought from the picture that it was the group of toys shown.

gift,1
Already falling apart after 2 months,0
"Item arrived as promised. Really like these bags, large and easy to tear.  Will definitely add to my list of regular buys.",1
The stitching started coming out of the velcro area on one wrap after one wear and they are pretty thin.,0
It looks nice but extremely light weight.  Not much stronger then a ribbon.  I bought it to go with a harness of the same color.  I don't trust it to hold up on a 85 lb. dog if suddenly needed.,0
The Premier Collar's are the best on the market.  I love the no slip design and great colors.  The Shipped Radio Systems Corp did what they agreed to and got them to me fast and in brand new condition.  I bought a second collar from this company.,1
I have an 11 month old beagle who did not digest these well.  His poop cycle and schedule became unpredictable after a couple of weeks.  His cycle returned to normal after about 5 days of not eating these any longer.,0
"It does absolutely nothing to deter my cats. Maybe my cats just don't mind the smell, but it doesn't matter how often I apply it or how much I spray.",0
Killed sooo many fish!!! this thing cranks wouldn't use it in anything smaller than a 55 gallon and even in there the fish are swimming for their lives,0
"Cody Black, the famous 13lbs Bichon-Poodle Mix loves this bed.  The quality is good and so is the look.  Cody Black looks so comfortable you wish they made a human version.",1
I am disappointed with this blanket. Size is too small and quality is so-so.,0
Broken in a matter of weeks.,0
what can i say about cat food? my cats are not finicky eaters the ease of having cases 12 or 24 cans on hand instead of running to store makes my life easy,1
"Although this litter did help with the smell, it was very dusty and actually caused my cat to develop a red, swollen eye and sneezes. Discontinued used and it all went away.",0
We had this for about three months and it looked nice the bubbles were great and then a couple weeks ago the water started going brownish green even with me bumping water changes up to 50% once a week. After three weeks of that I tore the whole tank apart and when I pulled this out I saw that a lot of the paint was missing and I tossed it. It's been two weeks since then and my water is back to normal so it could have only been one thing. I do still have and use the airstone that came with it it's just hidden by plants now though only half of it produces bubbles.,0
"The product  works exactly like the description.

The only thing to remember is that any loud sound can set it off, so you can't leave it turned on for extended periods of time.  I mainly use it when the house is quiet as that's when my dog is most likely to bark at unknown sounds outside.

I tested it outside when the neighbor's dog was barking and it stopped them, too.  :)

What I like most about this product is that there are multiple levels (low, med, high) of strength so you can control the effectiveness.  Also, a little green light comes on when controller is activated (emitting sound) so you know when it's working or when to change the batteries.",1
For the price I expected it to be higher quality. It is not. It has not weathered well for the last two months. I am not impressed.,0
Very nice  my. Dog loves. This  food. I love the  service thank you,1
"Much larger than expected. Not suitable for puppies. After return shipping fee, only received a $3 refund.",0
last two shipments arrived and the product was spoiled.,0
"My dog ate the everlasting treat so fast. I was really hoping for this to work, but sadly, by dog is too smart. Waste of money.",0
Did not work at all q waist of money,0
This blanket came apart in the very first wash- for $20 it was not worth it. Very disappointed. Would not purchase this again or recommend.,0
"My 25# pug/chi mix destroyed these in 5 minutes.  Pulled the squeaker, ripped the yarn and pulled apart.  Definitely not as durable as I was hoping they would be.",0
"I used the leash with the harness from the same company to air travel with my cat.  Of course my cat would rate these items as 0 star because he hated wearing them. But thanks god! It saved my life in the airport at least a couple of times! If you air travel with non-cooperative 11pound cat, you NEED the harness and the leash.

Although you can buy some cute and artsy leash made from natural cotton, this is much cheaper and does the job.",1
"This seat cover is very durable. I like how the seat buckle holes can close so dirt/hair does not fall into the cracks. I have a two door cobalt so it was not practical for me to hook the one end to the front seats because it would kinda block access to the back seats so by dogs could jump in easy. I instead just layed that part on the floor board and attached it to under my front seats,and it works fine.",1
I purchased one of these before. I think this was defective. It was really quiet and sounded like it was dying.,0
"My papillon gets frequent bladder stones and I tried this product and it seems to be giving him the relief I was looking for. I started out giving him the recommended twice daily dose with his food (which he likes) for a month, and now am only giving it to him once a day three times a week. He's doing good!",1
"These are not very loud like the ones I used in training classes.  I recently learned about the Pet Training Clicker Set by Ecocity.  Much louder, easy to use same price better strap.",0
Just received this light and installed. So far it is amazing. Covers much more area in my tank than my previous 2 120 watt LEDs. And with 4 channels the programming has endless possibilities. I am just getting started with this so if something changes I will let you know.,1
"It was a good price and the legs very loudly and firmly snapped into place. The bowls were also a good size for a Lab. It has nice stoppers on it so it dosent wobble or slide, BUT the stoppers are on 2 different sides! To get them facing the same way the ugly unfinished part of the plastic on one leg needs to face outward. It looks terrible and cheap when its functional and when you put it together the correct way it looks decent but you cant use it because of the stoppers. Very dissapointed in this product.",0
"For something with the name whisper, this thing makes so much noise. Right out of the box it makes this horrible grinding noise. I'm hoping that my pump is defective, because there is no way this thing should have gone to market in this condition. I will not buy from company again.",0
"Diapers work OK. They are pretty small. It feels like I have to pull so tight just to get it to barely fit. A lot of times the Velcro snaps off and the diaper falls off. Also, wasn't happy that after 1 wash on a gentle cycle, one of the diapers started to come apart. Wouldn't buy again.",0
"I was looking for a container that had enough room to hold the 15 pound bag of food I usually buy while still being compact enough to fit in our small home. This container fits both of those requirements. The lid securely locks into place, so I don't have to worry of my pesky cat pilfering any of the dog's food. For the price, you can't beat the quality of this container.",1
"This is the best tag, High quality and the lettering stands out and stand up  to rubbing against the vaccine tag that has to be worn. Recommend x10",1
A must have for cat owners. My cats love this more than any other store bought catnip product. Only problem is sharing.,1
"This collar was not very user friendly. Also, it didn't even work. When on the low setting it didn't even pick up my dog's bark but on the higher setting it would go off at any sudden movement. I do not recommend this collar.",0
"This doggie door is a good one. Easy to install, well made with heavy duty plastic and the door flappers are very thick.  That might be the only problem as some dogs do not like the thickness to push through.  Also, there are two flaps.  I had to remove one as the dogs would NOT go through the door with the two flaps.  Too confusing.  Otherwise, it is a good product for the money.",1
Easily separate!  Smell great!  Dual purpose!  I use it to put my kitty litter clumps in...and nothing trickles out of the bottom seam!  I say add a cat to the dog on the logo and you double the purpose!  Love it!,1
Works good to keep my dogs ears clean,1
I have 3 small dogs and they love it. It's very soft and cozy.,1
I added this powder into my dog's food. It didn't work for any of my three dogs.,0
The collars are flawless but the remote only charged one time out of the box and ever since it won't charge.,0
"Maybe it's too big, or she's not used to working for her treats (and my cat IS a bit skittish), she runs away if it makes too much noise rolling around.  It's really sturdy and love how easy it is to fill and adjust the hole size to the treat size... maybe she'll get used to it and figure out the reward.",1
Lennie loves this ball and was so happy to get a new one!,1
My Siamese kitten loves it!,1
I bought this for someone in the service dog community who was extremely tight on money. So I offered to buy her a Julius K9 since I knew how good their reputation was. She loved it and the quality was fantastic. I myself will be buying some for my Service Dog and my other working dog.,1
I really like the look of these collars and leashes.  Last year I purchased the green and brown ones for my lab and border collie.  I liked them so much I had to buy the blue one for my new dog.  But I also like that they all have nice matching collars and leashes.,1
Just what I wanted when they said it would come. The dogs love it.,1
"My dog loves this thing! He will push it around the house for hours. I love that you can add parts to make it a little more difficult because my dachshund caught on pretty fast. Only reason I rate this a four and not a five is because it's all plastic and makes so much noise rolling across my hardwood floors. Also, everywhere my dog takes it he runs it into something. So when he's pushing it around in the living room it's beating up my furniture. Thinking if this was made of a different material it might be quieter and not so harsh on my furniture and floors.",1
"Does not fit right and the collar is not small enough to keep the cat from escaping once the Velcro is out. In other words, the Velcro piece is too small and the collar belt is too large!.",0
"It definitely will get your dogs attention. I was hesitant in spending so much for this but glad I did.  It has been a stress saver for us using this on our Teddy-bear Golden doddle.  what a energetic hard head breed at 7 months.  She is a different dog, and very rarely had to correct her.  No one could stand to be around her,  but now she is getting the love and attention she deserves.  Be careful with this unit it has a lot of power. Make sure you are aware of your settings before correcting your dog.  We have had this for about 2 months and no problem with battery power.  She wears it all day long.  I take it off of her at night and it goes right back on her in the morning.  I charge the collar about every third day.  This unit is very well built.  I can not vouch for their lower cost models.",1
"Despite it never being used (cats wouldn't get near it) it was constantly gummed up from slime.  These are a terrible design.  Under-powered and the charcoal filters are a joke.  Cats don't care about ""taste"" they just want it to be moving and aerated.  I have two male cats with urinary problems and the vet was always saying to ""get them to drink more water"" but how do you do that???  I almost came back to buy a more expensive version of these knowing I was just throwing my money away.  Then I saw some you tube videos of people making them themselves.  I bought a cheap aquarium filter (the $10 kind you use for turtle tanks) and viola.  Cats were terrified of it and again wouldn't get near it but I just left it.  It didn't take long however before everything in the neighborhood was GUZZLING out of it (I have it outside).  Today it was 36 degrees so it's not frozen but for the last two weeks it's been in the teens and the running part never froze even though it had ice all around it.  First winter I haven't had to deal with frozen solid water dishes.  More importantly it's the only water source around for animals in the winter and I don't mind helping my neighbors pets out :)  Just from cats (it's in my fenced back yard) I've been adding a 1/2 gallon of water a day.  In my picture it looks tipped but that's because my cat knocks it a little when he drinks.  I can see on Amazon I bought the filter on September 14th (Tetra Whisper In-Tank Filter up to 20 gallons) and there has been no maintenance other than replacing water as of today November 24th.",0
Very disappointed in our dogs tag as his name was not spelled correctly,0
My dogs love them and they're good for them,1
Excellent quality,1
"The sizing is a little tricky to figure out. I have an 18 pound puggle that has a larger chest so I bought the large. The neck part is a little big on her but the part that goes past her chest might be too tight if I got the medium. It doesn't affect it's performance at all, it does slip a bit but it keeps me from pulling on her throat and that's what's important. I've gotten so many compliments on this. It washes great and is just adorable!",1
Dog loved it...tried to climb in before it got all the way down. She doesn't always like our presents.,1
"About once or twice a year my mastiffs will get diarrhea. I always make sure we have this on hand, it gets them regular after the 1st treatment.",1
It's basically an adjustable whistle that can annoy other people. But it has absolutely no effect on pets. Cannot even get it to a frequency that I can't hear. I'm almost 30.,0
Cat likes it but still drinks from the faucet. Need to clean it weekly or it smells like a fish tank.,1
"My 8 week old Sheltie previously had not chewed though anything before. I got this late Saturday, it's now Tuesday and I doubt this harness will last another night. My pup has nearly chewed through the strap. I'm hoping some bitter apple stops him.",0
"Bought this for my 15 lbs chihuahua mix. In theory I suppose it would work good for a larger dog but my dog had a hard time trying to get the food, which I know is the point, however he wasn't able to get his kibble due to the bowl being too tall. His small tongue could not reach the bottom to eat the kibble. 1/1/2018 changed review from 3 stars to 1 because Amazon won't refund me my total amount! Only got $2.50 for an item I paid $7.39 for!!! BAD service!",0
The animal is very cute in which my dogs love. Unfortunately within 5 minutes my dog had all of the feet off. I am very disappointed because I thought it was to be durable.,0
Strong enough for my Rottweiler.,1
"Coco is in love with these. A great alternative that doesnt dissapper as fast as the typical treats, I feel great about the quality of the product I got and feel good about giving them to coco. Made and sourced in the USA is also another plus",1
"Awful, do not purchase. Ordered 2 that were supposed to be 8-10"" but neither are. One is less than 4"" and not at all safe for my 60lb dog. Very disappointed.",0
"I purchased 2 Rubit clips, one medium and one large.  One disappeared within days along with the attached tags which have never resurfaced (one reason I bought them was to keep them secure, the other was that I needed them to be easily removable so I can wash their collars as I am fighting yeast issues and one had serious pathogen problems when adopted so I needed to keep everything CLEAN).  I suspect the first one disappeared from scratching.  The second, I am not sure at all... the dog is a wild child so no telling what she got herself into.  That one ended up with the bottom of the clip broken off in less than a month.  Also had ordered both in blue, the one that stayed on for just shy of a month already showed signs of wear and I could see the silver underneath.  Luckily the tags for the 2nd ended up in the house, though I never did find the section of the clip that broke off.  I am trying out the chains that military use for dog tags, so far so good at over 2 months.",0
"I gave this product 2 stars because it was packaged well and delivery was fast. However, my cat did not want anything to do with this food. I have tried so many different brands of cat food but seems my best bet is with Fancy Feast. I still continue my search for a wet food that my cat will continually eat. She gets tired of every wet food I give her, no matter what brand or how expensive it is. If anyone has any suggestions then please let me know. As far as this brand, it does not work for my cat, it may work for yours though so I don't want to suggest not to buy it. I hope this helps in your decision.",0
Wish I could return. I thought that this would have free floating fish and be slightly interesting for my cats.  It is just a film of fish going exactly horizontally by.  I could have made this with $3 of craft film and saran wrap.  Cheap and uninteresting.,0
"Holy crap, I can't believe how well this worked in such a short period of time. I'm guessing 2-3 hours because I wasn't downstairs, but 3 hours tops. I didn't get it on Amazon (Petsmart) because it was recommended to me when I was checking my PH levels at the store. I came downstairs and was shocked at how nice it looked from where it was earlier. I think it's even a touch clearer today. I put in almost a full teaspoon into a 55 gallon tank. I mixed it with some tank water first, then added it.",1
This only worked on one of my dogs not good for flop eared dogs ! Only good for my terrier dog and she hide for an hour after ward,0
"no way of shutting it off, drained the batteries the first time using it.  My Mokie was scared to death of it.  I will not be using it again",0
"this will be the 4th feeder in 2 weeks, buyer beware. these are absolute junk.  they do not feed on time, and of poor quality.
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
My cats do not have fleas but the vet recommended this to get rid of old fur. This works better on my cats than any brush I have owned. It really gets off all the shedded fur and is great for getting out knots.,1
"All my cats love this, and many of my 12 cats are very picky. Unfortunately, it is not grain free, but I am having a hard time trying to convince my cats they don't need those empty ""carbs""!",1
Jell leaked out all over and left a huge mess had to duct tape over handle,0
Didn't come in any package... I'm probably not going to let my dog chew it. Disappointed.,0
This stuff works great for flushing down the toilet. Doesn't really clump though and it doesn't mask the smell at all.,1
Taste great and my cat loves them too!,1
The mouse is just placed in a hole. Falls out easily when our cat plays with it.,0
I haven't noticed the slightest difference on my cat. Stopped using it.,0
"I somewhat noticed this product starting to work but it was WAY too hard to use the little dropper. I have a strong large dog and getting her to sit still for eye drops is impossible. I had to have a friend forcefully grab her and hold her eye open and even then I had to stick the tip of the dropper in to make sure it was getting in her eye. I would MUCH rather prefer that they made a queez bottle that you can point and squeez into the dogs eye. That way even if the dog moves the stream can follow and the product will soak the eye.

Had to return the product since I could not use it.",0
I purchased four of these id tag holders.  Absolutely worthless piece of junk.  My dog has had all four of these unclick somehow and have lost four id dog tags as a result,0
Tiniest toy I've ever seen. It looks like something you'd get in a kids meal.,0
"These are awesome! I think I already reviewed it with my other purchase of these, but I have 4 total. They work so well! They keep my dogs out of them because it doesn't let a lot of smell out (if any I can't smell but I can't attest to my dogs not being able to).",1
These are very easy to use. They do run a little big and twist while using them. I guess it depends on the size of your finger.,1
great deal i will be buy this again,1
"ordered these for a kid with a snake but no credit card... 1 of 3 did not work out of the box, another failed in 48 hours... zoomed promptly replaced them... ... a good product but prone to failures.. an in tank temp gauge  and a thermostat is highly recommended.or they are on ..  24/7 regardless of tank temp. .  without a thermostat automatically turn them off ...  bad things can happen. After listening to the kid tell me how well those on glass heat gauge tapes work  (kind that turn colors)  I put a temp probe in the tank... it was way to hot on a cold day...  I rigged up an thermostat with in tank sensor probe that holds inside of tank to an ideal temp....  Good for the snakes and should help the early burn out some people say these are prone to.",1
"I got this crate for an incredible price. Now I know why. It is fine and will work well for the dog content to be in the crate. But as a few others have pointed out it is a very thin gauge wire. Because it is thinner than the crates you find in the stores it does not feel very sturdy - however, I believe it will be fine for me. This is our third crate and the other two are substantially thicker wire and feel very sturdy and secure. I hope this works out - I'm betting it will but if I had to do it again I would pay more more a thicker gauge wire and better quality.

UPDATE: (also removing a Star)
After 1 month of use I have had to fix the door, use fasteners (tie-wraps) to hold it together and straighten the wires several times. The wire is about the strength of laundry mat hangers. It bends super easy and for this size crate 42""x27"" and the size of dog you would put in this it is just way too flimsy. Our dog just gets excited to see us and paws at the door and he bends the wire all up.

Last issue. This comes with a worthless divider. It can not be used for anything except making the crate space smaller. You can not get to half the crate because the side door is smack in the center of the crate and it opens towards the front door. So you can not divide the crate in a way that allows access to the second area. Also unless you just want a 4"" section you will have to put the divider on the side door making the side door useless. So if you need a big crate that can be divided into two useable sections keep looking.",0
"I  don't like this thing , it's getting so strong stinking smell ,that smell  making my fish get sick
the smell like chemical form the material , it may will become to poison in the water and kill the fish
 I have to clean up my fish tank . and change all the water for my fish tank to removed the smell
 I hate this",0
It fit my 110 pound Great Dane!,1
My dogs love it and it is a healthy food...but...price has jumped by $12.00 in 3 months so I am shopping around.,1
I purchased this for our 35lb Goldendoodle and it is wonderful. I measured as was stated and ordered a large.  I had previously ordered the harness advertised on tv and it was so cheaply made that it tore on the first outing. We've used the puppia harness alot as we camp and I like to take my dog for walks.  The harness is comfortable enough to leave on your dog.  I liked the harness so much that I ordered another one in a different color.,1
"If you have a long hair dog I would not recommend this. I have a 1yr old Sheltie weighing in at 32lbs & this did not work for her long hair. I had much better success on her shedding with a brush &  FURminator deShedding Tool for Dogs, Medium, Long Hair. I would not waste your money on this item.",0
good sized temporary cage for my two cockatiels.  we took them to florida with us on an extended vacation.,1
"I've had this filter set up for about 6 weeks. It ran perfect and I was very happy with it. Yesterday it started ""pulsating"" and making loud gurgling noises. The output is also intermittent. I have taken it apart, and tried priming it 4 different times, and it is still doing the same thing. I went online and watched videos, tried to re-prime different ways and still no change. The output pulsates about every 5 seconds and the unit continues to make loud gurgling pulsating noises. Anybody have any ideas?",0
"The xtra large is for a very small dog, in fact I bet I could fit this on my cat if she would let me. I bought this for my Rottweiler and did not bother returning because of the hassle involved. Very misleading though.",0
"These pills do NOT dissolve!  I placed them in water to test how soluble they were, and they do not dissolve at all.  This means they are NOT absorbed by your animal.  I even broke them up and they still do NOT dissolve.  Very disappointed, as I have used VetriScience products before and liked them.  These are not worth using, and for sure not worth the money.",0
Thank God I found this collar. My 80 pound lab mix would not stop barking at everything. It was driving me and my wife crazy and wed even talked about finding a good home for him. I saw this collar and figured I had nothing to lose but $25 bucks. Worked perfectly and stopped the barking.,1
DO NOT USE - this product removed a large swath of my cat's neck hair and left the skin raw and scabbed.,0
This has turned out to be my cats favorite place on nice mornings.  It took a bit of effort to figure out how to fold it back into the case but has gotten easier for me with time.  The enclosure seems durable and is certainly spacious for my cats.  They are super happy!,1
"We struggled with a telescoping pet ramp for several years.  It was big, heavy, unwieldy, and the piece that kept the two sections from coming apart soon broke.  The Solvit Bi-Fold Pet Ramp is wonderful.  It is light, easily navigated by our 80 pound lab, and folds into a manageable size for storing.  We absolutely love it and would recommend it to any dog owner.",1
Helps with old smells on carpet,1
"I bought this rope after my cat tree (covered in that cheap carpet stuff) started coming apart.  I wrapped it around without taking the other fabric and tied it off.  It's been secure for 3-4 months now, and my cat loves it.  I definitely recommend for cat-scratching needs.",1
"I purchased these for my dog because she is just 4 pounds and didn't want her to jump off the bed and if she did not be able to get back up on her own. I did a lot of searching and the price on these are great, I found so many that were double and triple the cost of these. They look nice and fit great on my very tall bed. I liked them so much I purchase another one for my mom for her dog. I would recommend these to anyone who has a small pet. My Granddaughter even uses them to get up on my be. 5 stars because I have nothing negative to say about this product.",1
"Our dog gets kibble made from fish and sweet potato. These sure help her ""fish breath"".",1
I have ordered these several times and they always come in a timely manner and my dog loves them.  It is much easier to order online then to go to the pet store and find they are out of bully sticks.,1
"We have a very hyperactive puppy that loves to chase things, but isn't so good at fetch yet.  When this arrived today, we took him outside to try it out, and about five minutes later he was completely worn out (flopped on his side with the toy in his mouth and his tail thumping around).  He loves it!",1
"I've tried visiting every store around where I live. From general/grocery stores to specialty pet shops I searched for pans and every one I found was an inch or a half inch either too large or too small. That said I had my share of returns before I went with my cage measurements to the internet and found this, just the right fit. Thanks online shopping!!",1
Made cheap,0
My bunny loves these.  He is a Netherland's dwarf (less than 3 lbs full grown) and he can work on one of these for weeks.  Good for the teeth and distracts him from tearing into other things that he shouldn't be spending his time on.......like digging the carpet.  Gotta love my little man!,1
"Now I'm not sure what natural care mosquito repelant repels, but it certainly isn't mosquitoes. Bought a bottle a Walmart for my evening walks with my two doggies and all 3 of us got ate up so bad I had to come home and write this review in order to save someone else from what I just experienced. I soaked all 3 of us, I'm talking super soaker style and we still got ate to smithereens. Do not under any circumstances buy this product, moreover, it burns. When I sprayed it on my skin on the inside of my elbows it caked up and burned. I really wanted to like this product because I dislike using products with deet. But if this is what I have to go thru, then that's fine I'll stick with the deet products",0
A great dog food for dogs like mine that are allergic to chicken and beef. She enjoys it and it's affordable.,1
"Purchased these by accident awhile ago and glad I did. Best bags I've used. They are a big thicker and darker than many other eco bags. Thus, they are more secure and discrete. They tear off the roll easily and don't tear where they shouldn't. The scent is unlike any other bag I've used. I can only describe it as being part of the bag and not added to it. The scent isn't overpowering and doesn't fade. My 1st order was done in error. The listed price at that time was just a test amount the seller was using while setting up his account. It was unbelievably small. Instead of just telling me the bags weren't available at that price and cancelling out the order, he sent a reasonable number of bags, a holder, and a sample dog magazine. Absolutely excellent customer service!",1
"It's pretty and pink. It's a nice addition to put in other places throughout the home, because it's small. But for multiple cats, not big enough except for an added addition, very cute.",1
"Recieved this when the sun was still up. Couldn't wait, had to know the truth. Horrible idea. This works great during the day and even better after dark...a little too well. Be prepared to Move",1
My Golden destroyed this literally within 5 minutes of giving it to him. I've bought great stuff from Kong before but this was garbage in the blink of an eye.,0
"Broke within a week, don't waste your money or time",0
It doesn't stay connected I will not put it on my animal - affraid it will come apart & my animal will be gone......very disappaointed!,0
"disappointed, as I LOVED the previous XS vest harness and decided to order it in the next size up - graduating to a small.  The part that fits the underbelly on the XS measures 61/4"", the part that fits the underbelly on the Small measures 11 1/4"".  It is so big for him that it covers up his little ""wienie"" and he can't 'pee' without wetting the fabric.  That 5 inches seems a HUGE increase in size from one size to the next!?!",0
I don't usually write reviews. But honestly don't waste your money on this leash. The lights were for at most 2 minutes before beeaking. My dog is not big and was not pulling. Very poor quality product,0
"I have tried everything from peroxide, vinegar, nature's miralcle... This definitely works the best!  It takes out the yellow coloring and the smell.  Product smells great as well.  I am a fan!",1
Just as described,1
"Started throwing new growth within a week
Perfect",1
I don't know if they worked as my dog refuses to eat them,0

I ORDERED THIS IN JULY AND IT HAS STOPPED WORKING ALREADY. PAID 87.00 FOR THIS JUNK.. NOW I CAN'T SEND IT BACK. BECAUSE TIME HAS EXPIRED .. FIRST OF ALL IT DIDN'T EVEN COLOR THE WATER THAT WAS COMING OUT OF THE HEAD LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD...JUST OTHER DAY LED LIGHT'S HAVE STOPPED WORKING. I DO AGREE THIS IS JUNK.MONEY WASTED. SORRY PRODUCT...DON'T BUY NO GOOD..,0
"This was everything I needed! I bought this just for the can covers but fell in love with the spoon. The spoon is genius! Its so easy to use, even my 4 year old can do it! Im ordering it again because I lost the spoon and nothing else works as well! The covers fit perfectly and have stayed on even when dropped (from about 4 feet). I bought this a year ago and have yet to find an issue!",1
Very durable and stylish! I get so many compliments with this pet purse!,1
"Super thin!! But I suppose that's what you get for the cost, there is almost no padding at all whatsoever. It is soft and the color is accurate compared to the photo - I got the dark grey. I honestly would not recommend this bed.",0
This product is garbage. Bought because my dog gets freaked out by all of the fireworks on the 4th of July as many neighbors have arial boomers and we were planning to go to the city display and leave her at home. The dog has worn many coats in cold weather so is used to that - and this is like a windbreaker. It provided no benefit whatsoever and simply annoyed her. Just logged in to amazon to return and apparently the return window has closed - less than a month. My bad. Its probably because they know this thing is junk and hope you're not paying attention to purchasing details. I bought this because of the TV commercials and raving reviews which I suspect are fake. Save your money.,0
"The collars shredded the first time they were on. When I contacted the company, they said they cannot replace the collars.",0
I have been looking for this for a while now and all the stores in my area never carried them. Works great on my yorkie!,1
Awesome so much better than a cage.,1
"I wanted to get an automatic litter box to avoiding cleaning out the old litter box. It was getting gross. Well, this one was way worse to clean and even more disgusting.

Cons:
-The lid stopped shutting, so if I didn't go over and close it every time after it went off, it would make the bathroom smell
-Poop got stuck to the rake
-It scared the hell out of my cat (later on, not at first)
-It would constantly break and the little red light would blink
-A few times it just kept going and going and going and going and going
-And if you know how loud it is, the above can be annoying
-I'd spend more time cleaning it out/fixing it then I ever did with my normal, non-automatic litter box
-After about a month and a half when it began dis-functioning more often than not, Oliver stopped using it and would pee outside the litter box
-It was gross pulling out the poop tray
-I never saw clumps on pee in the tray, I believe that is because it sank to the bottom when the rake pushed over it (It could be that I didn't have a good enough clumping litter, but it was the same litter I used before with my old box and it clumped just fine)

Pros:
-It fit perfect under the bathroom sink (yay for good measurements)
-It was nice to have when we first moved in, something extra I didn't have to worry about for a few days (unless any of the above happened)
-Oliver took a liking to it right away (but stopped using it eventually)

Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this product. I wouldn't recommend an automatic litter box at all, but that's just my opinion. Lesson learned. I'll never return!",0
"It is a good product, however not for our dog.  She pulls and the lease does not retract fast enough and it gets tangled in her legs.  She is a pit-bull mix and just might be too strong for the lease that I ordered",0
"Terrible bags.  The absolute worst product I have ever come in contact with.  They tear almost immediately, and if you are patient enough and get one off the row without tearing it, and get as far as being able to use it, you end up with poop on your hands, 3 times!
I can not say anything more about this. TERRIBLE.",0
"Originally they were fine, but within a month one fell off the cage and was lost. That cage is no longer useable.",0
"This tank is absolutely beautiful, I get so many compliments on it! I have 1 betta in the tank with a few decorations. However the problem is the waterfall is wayyy to strong for him. I did the hack I've seen in the other reviews by using a water bottle to help slow the stream. It kinda works but my betta still can't use 50% of the tank because he will get flopped around. I also had to add a plant under the filter because he had almost gotten sucked up.

I am also not sure but as soon as I got this tank his fins started the ""fin rot"" I have tried treating it but I think it's him always struggling with the current. Because my tank is cleaned regularly.

I wish I would have returned it in time.",0
Good for my very chew-happy dog. She's still working on it a month later!,1
"While the ingredients are very wholesome, my cat actively dislikes this food.  I'm going to donate it to a rescue group and hope that homeless cats will eat it.  I gave it two stars for the nutrition profile though.",0

Not that great,0
"Fear and trembling from our dog:  these clippers have our normally docile small dog crying before the clippers are even cutting the nails.  They crush the nails, not cut them.  Should I have rated it one star?  Gosh, it's not my nails so I'm being generous.",0
Good quality and good price for the amount,1
"I bought these test strips thinking that they would be a good substitute for a liquid test kit, but I was wrong. They are very inaccurate and even just a tiny bit of moisture in the bottle will ruin all the test strips. The only thing they are good at is giving you a rough estimate of your water parameters. Don't skimp on aquarium supplies; go ahead and get yourself a better quality test kit and don't waste your times with strips like these.",0
"Great item, very well made.",1
"What the heck. You gave me a ""knock off"". In the description it says by super pet.  WELL. ITS NOT. I am PISSED. How I know this is a knock off is I bought one from the store.  And it was double this price. I saw this and was like I can have 2. The top. Will NOT open. And it will not close. Or fit in correctly. It's not sturdy and I'm pissed. EITHER MAKE THIS RIGHT BEFORE I START FILING COMPLAINTS AT THE MAIN OFFICE.",0
"My husky puppy LOVES this toy. Great size for a smaller dog or growing puppy. Very well-made, too. My dog is not a very aggressive chewer, though so I am not sure how this toy would stand with wear and tear like that. I've washed it multiple times, too and each time it comes out looking brand new. Great purchase!",1
Makes an awful noise.,0
"Perfect fit

Comfortable for dog to lay on",1
"This food needs to be evaluated by Amazon and potentially removed from the site, and checked out by an independent party, and veterinarians.

I have all 3 of my cats vomiting all the time since starting this food. at first, even the first day, one of them. i didn't think too much about it, but now 10 days later all 3 of them.

If the manufacturer doesn't come here and address this, its very telling. either way it doesn't matter as i'm not trying this stuff ever again. Perhaps Amazon should do something about this directly.",0
"We received  this collar for our dog today, we were careful to read directions regarding size prior to purchase. We place the collar on are dog and made the appropriate adjustments. We placed her in her crate for the evening and just checked on her before we retired for the night. THANK GOODNESS we checked on her jaw was locked open with her mouth under the collar. This collar could have caused major damage if she went overnight like that. My wife is in tears and I am angry!  This product should be taken fro the market or at the very least re engineered  with a breakaway of some sort. In the time she had this on she had manage to chew thru most of the webbing.  If you value your pet, DON'T purchase the product.",0
Best dog toy for your water loving friend,1
Sophie likes them.....gets excited when offered a cookie.,1
"My senior chihuahua terrier has a floating patella and we were having troubles getting him to be active at all. It was obvious he was hurting and his weight was creeping up. I suspected glucosamine would help him, but he'd refused the chewable pills in the past. I saw these & decided to try them. Since he's a small dog, his weight means he only needs 1/4-1/2 a piece per day. I cut them in quarters and he gets one every morning. He loves them. After a month, he was a completely different dog! He loves going for walks. He plays with our other younger pup. He seems happy and young again. He's even lost weight because he's so active again. I would highly recommend these to anyone with a dog with joint issues.",1
"these are the only treats my pitbull loves, he hops around so happy when he gets one",1
"My 4 year old pug loves these. I have to give him something that will fit in his mouth and will take him more than 10 seconds to eat, these do the trick.",1
great product,1
"Very nice fit, and quality.",1
easy use,1
I have two chinchilla's and they love this product! They chewed one so much I had to get a third one. It's a product I don't mind getting!,1
Pretty and good for the price.,1
Our kitties love it!!  Next best thing to a lap.,1
Worked well for my cats.,1
"I've always used the regular ""litter tray with the scooper"" procedure but when I saw this type, it seemed too good to be true. It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional ""sweeping step"" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have ""strained"" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method.",0
Much too small for our cats. We ended up donating it to a shelter for kitten use.,0
"didn't work on my maltese, but he enjoyed the soft chews as a ""treat""",0
I have tried to give to our dogs by itself and cheese balls.  Not one of 4 dogs will take it.  Total waste of money spent! :(,0
"These are not my first version of these tennis balls, but for some reason this package seemed to be more poorly designed than previous items. The plastic squeaker seems to be placed a bit differently than the previous version and fell out of the tennis ball after about three tosses. My dog loved the previous purchase because the squeaker seemed to work for a long time - unfortunately the three in this package seemed to be defective (had the same problem with all three). The price is great so I might order another set in hopes it was a fluke, but I was definitely not happy with this set.",0
I am still waiting for the manufacturer to send me the parts of the cat tree that arrived broken. So for now my kitties still cannot enjoy their new tree. The bottom house was broken and the top slab that holds the top house was broken. I have been waiting a very long time to get these parts. Some of the connectors were not in the box either. I wish that I could give them a zero...,0
"My two cats love it, I love the hidden compartment for the catnip.  They enjoy batting it around together and alone",1
nice product,1
Would definitely recommend if you have turtles.,1
Great food for the 4 legged critters. Always has been..,1
I have a very strong pitbull and he's pull out the screw in grass ones so I tried this. So far it's a win and isn't moving at all,1
goDog toys are the absolute best.  The last longer than any other plush toy. This particular toy was brought for a friend's new puppy and I've heard that Juno the Rottweiler is a big fan!,1
My dog loves these.  They are small so I can still give frequent treats without too much worry about fattening up my dog too much.  She's the needy type of dog that expects a treat for each paw of hers that I wipe after we come in from a walk.  It usually takes 3 or 4 treats to completely wipe her butt.  That's 7-8 treats each time we come in from a walk.  Each bag has a ton so I don't run out quickly.,1
My dog was able to chew threw this toy within minutes. I'm tired of being toys that I have to throw away the same day I buy them.,0
"I purchased this bird cage for my girlfriend along with two parakeets.  Although the cage comes with no instructions, I found it easy to assemble.  The cage snaps together and the fit seemed a bit loose, so I used small white zip ties (I happened to have on hand) to reinforce the joints.  The cage looks good and the shelf below is very convenient.  The wheels make it very easy to move around and it seems to be roomy enough for the two birds.  I would recommend this as a good starter cage for small birds.",1
"Very disappointed in the quality of this product. Our bird currently lives in a beautiful Avian Adventures large cage that is high quality & arrived in perfect condition. This item is a miniature version of the cage we have but the quality is no comparison. The cage panels are bent, all if the the door closure hardware is flimsy, cheap & difficult to use, there are numerous deep scratches (thanks for the included touch up paint but some of the scratches have sharp edges that have to be sanded smooth), scratches in the tray that were previously touched up with paint & the included rope perch is a cheap Booda knock off with plastic ends that stripped the first time we tried to secure them to the cage. We had to use pliers to bend pieces so they would fit together & the bowl holders had to be forced in with a hammer. Not sure if this was a previously returned cage or a close-out or what but wow, not happy & not the typical quality of Avian Adventures! Serious quality issues! We are keeping it & will fix what we have to because this is a temporary housing cage that won't be used very often & the price was lower than other sites, but buyer beware!",0
Great product!!,1
My 12 pound puppy completely shredded it in one day.  The Kong Monkey is still going strong after a week.,0
"If your dog has a little energy in him it's Impossible to put on, The Velcro doesn't hold. If you want the costume to look like the picture with your dog don't get your hopes up. If you have some Taxidermy I recommend dressing them up for Halloween with this.",0
"wonderful for my husky dogge, he loves it too",1
I have a 4 month old coonhound and she loves this.,1
tear up really easy,0
"This is a super fun toy for cats, mine loves it.",1
The zipper is flimsy. Since I opened it out of the package there was strings from the threading. Material is extremely difficult to clean. Wouldn't trust this outdoors. Too flimsy.,0
This actually made both of my cats throw up more than normal.  They typically eat Royal Canin Speciall 33 without problems.  Waste of money as it couldn't be returned.,0
"Wasn't as soft as I was expecting, thus thing is like a rock. Harder th a a nylabone .",0
Dogs love it.,1
The combs did not seem to fit the clipper properly and therefore my dog's hair got caught between the comb and the clippers.  I do not recommend these with the Andis Super 2 Speed Professional Clippers.  They just don't work together.,0
It is great! Far exceeded what I was expecting! I had it together in less than an hour but the cats were trying to climb it within ten mins. They love it!,1
After about an hour of chewing and those edges are SHARP! Poor girl won't be chewing on this anymore.,0
Do not buy this.  The bowl has a single screw that attaches the the crate.  So when your dog bumps into it the bowl spills.,0
I love this product because it gives the extra nutrients dogs need.  My dog loves the flavor and has had no problem eating it with her food.  I have noticed improvement in her skin and coat.  I definitely recommend it!,1
Broke the first time I used it.  Would only click once and wouldn't release...so I threw it away.,0
"Very disappointed. Its soft on the top but not after that, its like an air bag. My two girls dig and dig in it to make a comfy place to nestle and the baffles inside prohibit them from doing that. They end up sleeping on floor next to it...I bought two and Im returning both. Very slippery on tile floor too.",0
"I just got these dogtags after ordering them three days ago. They got here 4 days earlier than they were supposed to, and it's great! They are nice quality for the price, and I love the fact that they're personalized! Excellent service. Simple and quick. I will definitely be buying from these guys again.",1
My dog loves it!!,1
Garbage stopped working after 2 months,0
4 month old puppy chewed the raised parts off in 5 minutes. Not at all durable!,0
"Great scale, works for all the animals at the rescue",1
"I ordered this product based on the breed size indications provided by the supplier.  As soon as it arrived, I saw that it was WAY too big for my dog.  I have returned it to Puppia, unopened, along with the check of $2.50 they require for ""shipping"" a new harness to me.  They charged me more than $5.00 for the first shipment, so I don't understand why I have to pay another $2.50 for shipping.  They must have WAY overcharged me the first time, otherwise why the discrepancy between the two shipping charges?

As for the product itself, I can't comment until the properly-sized harness arrives.  Hope it will, since the item isn't cheap.",0
My dogs love them,1
DO NOT BUY!!!  This is an absolutely absurd price for this item.,0
yes,1
Product fine there was not supposed to be a shipping charge which was charged to my card,1
Dog learned boundaries very quickly!!! Very pleased with this product,1
My birds have shunned every aspect of this...,0
"My dogs hate it. I bought two (large & x-large). One was going into a crate for Smooth Collie who is crated only at night, and the other was to be for a much better behaved Rough Collie.  When I first laid them out, neither dog was interested.  At bedtime, the Smooth went into his crate.  All night I heard sliding and crunching around.  The bottom fabric is a thin stiff nylon with a rubberized texture (dots).  It literally crunches when touched so you hear every move the dog makes.  When I let him out in the morning, he grabbed the bed, pulled it out of the crate and dragged it to the patio door. While doing so, he tore the nylon fabric (not at a seam) and pulled off a chunk of the foam inside which is just a thin piece of corrugated memory foam.  My other dog sat on his new bed for a few minutes and then laid down on the tile floor.

Lucky that I sew.  I'm going to add padding to both beds and replace the crunchy fabric with something softer and quieter and see how that goes.  The beds they were replacing were from 1999 used by other dogs I had and I've made covers for them to re-use them over the years.  I bought these because they were on sale, reasonably priced and thought my guys would like them.  If the new covers I make don't lure them into using them, I'll donate them to the shelter.",0
The food is real and my Goldieloves it!,1
"Our dog is usually a 'medium' for dog coats and sweaters, etc. I expected the small to be too small, but it was actually too big. That really confused me. Also, there was practically *no way* to adjust it so the clip wasn't resting right at her 'armpit' causing her discomfort. Not okay. It did help *some* to deter her pulling, but not enough to put her through the trouble of having a hot-spot created where the clip rested.",0
"My rabbits love this, I use it in their toilet trays and they wee and poop in there, It absorbs so much wee and doesnt smell!!! It is great and really easy to use, but cleaning up, if it drops on the floor etc, is a little difficult hahaha But I will be using it always!
Thank You!!!",1
"I used pre pads,  but they leaked. These do not leak. And are washable, I don't put in the dryer.",1
my dogs just love them.,1
"My dog was running when the collar got caught and immediately broke in half. ...my dog is only 18 lbs so this is kind of a ridiculously easy break. Luckily she ran right to me instead of away; she is black and when it is nighttime, like it was when the collar broke, we can't see anything on her BUT her leash.  I definitely don't recommend buying this considering that it lasted about 2 weeks.",0
Large but to large for little girl had a hard time trying to figure out how to us.,0
"Just like in the pet store, but less money.",1
"I purchased this toy 3 years ago and it has held up really well. In fact, it's one of my dog's (boxer, beagle, pit mix) favorite toys! She loves to tear the squeakers out of stuffed toys so I thought this wouldn't last long. To my surprise we still have 2 out of 3 squirrels left, with squeakers in tact! Great purchase.",1
basically this only kept my dog from getting infested. but she still has fleas. no good,0
"I have an Australian Shepperd pup who is 9 months old, this was not the product for him. Initially, he loved it with his blankets and toys in there with him. Low and behold we left him in there by himself for the first time and that's where the chaos happened. For starters the mesh side is not that durable as he broke right though this. He realized he would not fit out the hole but if he shifted his weight he could turn the whole thing on it's side. So that's what he did. My husband came home to the pup running through the house inside of playpen like a hamster in a wheel. Somehow he figured out how to pull a shoe through the hole he had made so that was in there too, while he was running through the house like a deranged gerbil.",0
These boots are not for those who actually walk any distance. Two boots had holes in them with less than 40 miles walked. I walk on sidewalks and streets and wanted something to keep the salt from my dogs feet. Thsi is a poor choice to accomplish that.,0
"Best price around and I won't buy anything else.  I love that it works for ticks, fleas and mosquitos",1
"Wish there was a way to do a negative star. Horrible pad, leaks pee from one use of a 7 pound puppy. Don't buy.",0
Moved into an apartment with carpets and I put it underneath my garbage can and it's wonderful; it catches anything that may fall over!,1
Winner. All 3 of my cats love this product.,1
Great Product for a great price,1
"Our frogs seem to love these, not quite as much as blood worms, and they are growing.  Our frogs are completely aquatic and still quite small they are able to find these among the rocks at the bottom of the tank, if they land on any vegetation or rocks the frogs don't find them.  We did try a cheaper brand, but the pellets were so small they fell in between the rocks and we couldn't see how the frogs would find them to eat.

Only problem is our fish love them too and they see better than the frogs.",1
"Arrived sooner than i thought
Great quality and product exactly as described
Large enough for my pit bull",1
"My dog broke the welding on the door after a few times in it and escaped. Fortunately he's ok, but it broke easily. I got it because it was on a list of good dog crates, and it mentioned it was tough. Definitely not.
The wire was thinner than I was hoping for.",0
This is no fault of the seller but our 4 month old mastiff likes to 'bob for apples' and does not leave the rock in the bowl.,0
"I'm guessing this brand and/or line of product is designed for small (under 25lbs) dogs because I would have never guessed that a 17lb, 8 month old Boston Terrier would need an Extra Large! Definitely go by the size chart and hopefully you'll have an easier taking your dog's measurements than I did. With all that aside, this is certainly a blessing of a contraption for a dog with a big chest, bulbous head and little neck. I have seen a lot of harnesses that have to go over a dogs head first and that was not an option for my dog. The entire back opens up and closes with a very sturdy insert buckle and a large area of velcro. She has enough room in the neck area while still fitting snuggly safe in the body. When she runs out of leash (at a very fast pace I might add), her whole body is stopped; there is no whiplash or choking effect. The harness washes easily in the washer and dries quickly by just air drying. The camo pattern is a really cute too.",1
Not the sturdiest. Came bent on the top.,0
My dog loves these.  It is a nice change from the rib bones I buy.  I will definitely order them again.,1
Good quality dog crate for a great price.,1
Fell apart after 2 weeks,0
Cheap wood. Looks good and will hold my two rabbits in it. But I can not figure out how to install the the litter pan. The instructions are horrible. Super annoyed and stressed out.,0
My dogs would not eat it unless I added wet canned food.,0
Oh what the mail lady must have thought putting such a squeaky package in my mailbox lol...,1
"They're really good balls with a nice bounce to them, but they won't hold up to aggressive chewing.  My 9 month old Brittany puppy managed to chew through all three of them within a few weeks so even smaller breeds can tear them apart.

If you buy I'd recommend to only use them for play and not leave them laying around the house if your dog loves to chew.",0
"Shiny finish, engraving as asked, legible, cute kitty face outline. xD",1
"Made in CHINA never again , I love my dog !  NEVER AGAIN !",0
Perfect for newborn puppies and easy tool use. Will buy again for future litters.,1
"I have been using these to train my little Schnauzer.  He had started training from birth to use a pad, and at six weeks we continued, so he already knew to use them.  He also goes outside of course, but these come in handy during the night.  They are a bit on the thin side, but the only time I've had it go through so to speak is when he goes right to the edge to empty his bladder.  Then it tends to get on the floor as well.  When a fresh pad is put down, he enjoys laying on it in front of the window and sunning himself.  Having them delivered right to my door is nice.",1
Looked Good,1
"I bought a couple of this backpacks in order to carry my cats during a flight. One of my cats got stressed during the flight, and I was shocked to discover he was easily ripping apart the mesh at the sides of this backpack, even when his nails trimmed. I had to use a couple magazines to push the cat back by blocking the holes on both lateral meshes, during 4 distressing hours. I don't have to say I had the worst flight of my life. Stay away of this carrier if your pet is edgy, its flawed design can turn your trip in a real nightmare. I have just returned mines today.",0
so far so good,1
Good price. Works for all our needs.,1
"These arrived in the expected amount of time. I am using them with a Fluval 406. They are cut just a little small and must be stretched out before use. Kind of a pain in the butt. The price was nice and I guess that is why. I do not believe I will order these again. I did not contact the vender as I believe it will just be a hassle, not worth the time.",0
This is super cool! Very large & cozy!,1
"For donation to local animal shelter, from their Wish List.  They were very pleased.",1
I use this product for my dogs all the time and it is great  but my cats would not eat it.,0
"Nice and bright , nice that you can recharge.
But 5 months of use only 3 of the led lights work now.

---i am updating my review based on the response i have received from Yurgoa. They have offered to send me another collar to replace my broken one. Very professional thank you so much! Definetly want to give the collar another shot!",1
The puppy loves it mixed with some steamed carrots and celery.,1
"These are great for small puppies, but outgrow quickly.  Becomes a treat not a distraction. Good for when young 3 to 6 months but need something more after that.",1
My cat only wore this collar 1 day before the bell and bow fell off. Disappointed since the cats name is Wendy and this was her Peter pan inspired style,0
a lovely bird bath that looks like bronze. It is easy to place and stays where you put it. Haven't seen a bird in it yet though...lol,1
My dog loves everything stella and chewy. They're a great company with great products. I plan to feed my little Elsie stella and chewy for the rest of her happy wiener-mixed life!,1
My cats did not like this item. They are indoor cats and when I put them in it they meowed the whole time.,0
Amazing!  The fish go crazy over this stuff. First time I've fed it to saltwater fish and they absolutely love it.,1
"Arrived promptly, exactly as described",1
My dog usually loves salmon treats. Her dog food is ZwiPeak Fish & Venison. These are so hard he won't even chew on them. Our neighbor dogs eat anything and they dropped them as soon as I gave them to them. Very expensive for something I had to throw out!,0
this cleaner is great at loosening stuck on rat poop and for general cage cleaning.  it has a very nice fragrance as well.,1
Stop working after 1 month.  I want to return this defaulted item.,0
EXCELLENT FOOD FOR OUR CHIILA- SHE IS EATING THIS BRAND FOR A WHILE AND SHE LOVES IT,1
I have a dog with a very sensitive stomach and it didn't help at all unfortunately. I'm sure it works for others but not for me.,0
My dogs love it. They are pretty picky. It always arrive fresh. I can't say that about other dog products,1
This is the only food my cat will eat. That's it. He loves it.,1
"The crate itself is great! However I can't use it. The product dimensions in the description were 42""L  30""W  28""H which would just barely fit in the spce i need it for. However, when i got the product, that was not the case. The product measures 42""L  28""W  30""H. Kind of sucks cause i did a lot of searching to find a crate that wasn't taller than 28"" and still fit a large dog and end up buying something that was supposed to work but doesnt.",0
"I put this one inside the larger red one, and then I jam a treat into it. Keeps my 50-pound lab busy for quite a while trying to get them. We leave it around the house and she's never chewed it up...yet.",1
"I use this NR (non-refridgerated) version and love it!  Daily use for about a week and then just once or twice a week after leaves my Persian tear and stain free.  Have tried so many other products and this does the trick!  As always, questions are welcome and let me know if my review was helpful!",1
"It's the best, you gotta get this.",1
I bought two of them. Good quality but one trim was black and one was brown. Not a fan of that but I guess thats what you get for the price. Wont buy from them again though.,1
Nice! Now we gotta get our fur baby to use it.,1
"I got this for my Great Dane. It's perfect, and she loves being brushed now. Great tool for the price!",1
Perfect width for her little neck and I was able to attach her nametag. It wasn't easy but I got it on there. I wish this came in more colors. And in packs.,1
"never worked properly, maybe my blower was too small",0
"I noticed some wriggling rice in my dog's stools. Yeah, rice isn't supposed to wriggle. Voila, tapeworms! I got this dewormer and used it according to directions. Have not seen a reappearance of dancing Uncle Ben's in little dude's bowel movements since.",1
Didnt see any result,0
"well made, fit's my puppy perfect! & she doesn't mind wearing it at all.",1
"We suddenly became the ""owners"" of 5 wild kittens and needed a place for them to play. We didn't want to spend a lot either. This was the best choice for us. The kittens romp all over it & are becoming domesticated. I would certainly recommend this item to others. It is very sturdy and the kittens all love hiding in the 2 condo's and then pouncing on each other. I have hung toys from the various platforms and they bat at them from both top and bottom. Good valuue here.",1
"The purchase and delivery were fine... no problems.  However, the gate literally fell apart the day it was received (see attached pic).  We haven't purchased much from Amazon and wondering how to get an issue like this addressed?",0
"Love the large size matt but this one didn't work. Using the adapter to plug it n instead of using the battery, it just msde a poppng noise at regular intervals. Hubby was able to set his hand on it and barely felt anything. Sending it back as defective.",0
Boo! Totally stopped working after 1 use. Replaced the batteries and it worked 1 more time for 2 minutes then stopped. What is going on with this crummy thing?,0
"Great bed! My German shepherd loved it at first sight.  She climbed right up on it, and I have even caught my toddler cuddled up on the bed with the dog.

The design is simplicity itself with only four screws to tighten, but assembly could be a challenge to some, I suppose.  Read some of the reviews that mention assembly, and you'll get an idea of what you're dealing with.  The reviews which had detailed instructions were most helpful to me, but I can make things simple.

All you need to know is that you should wait until the bed is fully assembled before you tighten the screws all the way.  I just barely finger-tightened all four screws and then had my seven-year-old lie across the bed while I tightened the screws with a screwdriver. The bed frame will go slightly askew when you pick it up to move it, but once you set it back on the ground or floor it will straighten out.  No wobbles at all. After assembly, as I mentioned above, my 90 lb. German shepherd happily jumped on the bed without hesitation.

If I end up moving it a lot, I'll be sure to tighten the screws every few months or so.  However, I'd feel comfortable disassembling and reassembling it for travel.

I paid $29 and change for the bed (it has gone up $4 in price since I purchased it four days ago), which is less than any of the orthopedic or otherwise fancy-schmancy beds I have seen on Amazon or elsewhere.

The Coolaroo is a bargain.",1
"Rated this before.  We bought a big and small one.  Even the big one leaves barely enough room for the cat to do his business, and he sometimes ended up kicking turds out of the box or all over the wall because of the funny doorway.

Does not work very easily and is a hassle.  And it's expensive.  What a waste.",0
Love this,1
"I used this feeder every day to feed my kitty (who has an eating problem). It spun twice a day, and was very reliable. It did break after just about a year and a couple months - the motor just stopped motoring! It would move about an inch instead of the full spin. If you buy one, I would keep an eye on your feeder the moment it's coming up to it's one year birthday just in case, or later if yours is only used sporadically. (it does have a one year warranty by the way) I still give it almost full stars because when I called in to troubleshoot the device with the company the help I received was very kind, friendly, and they shipped me out a new one when we couldn't get it working. And for about $35, even if it breaks every year and a half of CONSTANT use.. I guess it's still worth it to keep my kitty eating healthy. :) Maybe we can put in a better motor in the future? or if not.. a replaceable one??? :)",1
"While this looks a bit goofy, it worked very well for my itchy Golden Retriever and kept her from chewing her hind leg.  It is light and super comfy for the dog and since it's not fully inflated, they don't bump into things in a jarring fashion. They just push past furniture, doorways etc. Also,it's really easy to slip on. At least for this dog, works far far better than the ""cone of shame"". And my shins are thankful too.",1
40lb dog ripped legs off within 30 seconds of having it.,0
"I live in Seattle and the birds LOVE this stuff. I have a lot of finches, chickadees and jays. It seems like I have to refill the feeder every 3 days, haha.",1
"I bought this filter because I read the reviews and saw excellent feedback. Its a week later and it sucked. It didn't filter the water at all. I took it out to clean it and it broke..... i decided to throw it away. What a waist of money.
PS. i bought this product for my turtles. I feel like this product is meant for fish not turtles... maybe that was my mistake.",0
"seems to me the food is not fresh, the expiration date is march. usually is more than a year. anyway...my cats didn't eat it",0
My 1 year old Catahoula Leopard destroyed this in about 4 minutes,0
Does not help my dogs at all. Not worth the money.,0
"The theory of this product is great. However, the execution left something to be desired.  Rolling the box to clean it caused litter to fall out of the sides (the joint) no matter how careful I was when I put it together.  We ended up duct taping the two halves together, which sort of solved the problem, but made it hard to take apart to refill/clean. It seems like there was a space or something that allowed litter to escape.

Also... well, there's no way to put this delicately, but if you have a cat with particularly soft/runny poo, this is NOT the box for you.  I repeat-- NOT for you. Soft poos just... go splat EVERYWHERE inside when you roll it.  Not fun.  And you might be able to wait for them to harden (if they do), but my cat wouldn't use the box if there was any poo inside of it at all. So that didn't work so well either.

Additionally, my cat grew out of this SO.FAST. It may be just because he was a big cat, but even when we bought it for him as a kitten, it was almost too small.  The regular is just not a large box, once you put the tray in and the hood on.

So, in conclusion-- great theory (if you don't have a soft pooper), but the execution fails a bit, in the liter-leaking problem and the fact that the regular just isn't all that large (at least I don't think so.)  We had much better results with a large rubbermaid container w/a hole cut in the lid.  Not as convenient to clean as the theory behind this would be, but then again, this didn't work out to be so convenient either.",0
"Sadly, these are NOT soft.  They are anything but.  I put them while still in the bag on a cement floor and bashed them with a hammer.  Not one of them broke up.  These are for wolves, not little 15-20 lb dogs.",0
"I didn't think it was possible to screw up tape. This is the thinnest and cheapest tape I've ever seen. Often I will inadvertently peel 2-3 layers because they are so thin. They also do not rip off easily. Overall, horrible product.",0
The holes were so small that the horse couldn't pull the hay out at all.,0
My dog absolutely hated it. Too hard and it did not smell appetizing to her. Gave it to my neighbor's dog that is also a puppy and he practically ate half of the bone. That can't be good for their stomach. I won't be purchasing nylabones again.,0
Seems to work okay.,1
Life with our rescue dog is MUCH more enjoyable with this collar and the accompanying spray -most all of her behavior issues are fear based and this is a great product.,1
A lot smaller then I imagined even based off measurements! Made very flimsy!  Cat won't lay in it because of the size and shes just a little 10 pound toy Siamese cat! Not to mention its so light that it moves of the wind blows! She Usually loves small spaces but this frightens her for some reason!  Unfortunately will be returning!,0
Used to buy all the time.. NO MORE..they lowered the price and said they changed the recipe. Dog got sick..every time she ate the food. Made FOUR attempts to get them to explain. We had to spend money at the vet...,0
"I saw some pretty good reviews for this brush so I thought I would try it. I have an Australian shepherd with very slick short hair. This product did not take any of his loose fur out. While it may just be an issue with the type of fur my dog has, this product did not meet my expectations.",0
"No dust, clumps great, cats are happy!
Wish it was just a little more affordable.",1
Quiet and powerful!,1
I have other EzyDog products and they are top notch. The collar is no different. The quality is superior to other collars. It will last a life time.,1
"Smooth transaction, but our dog did not like these.",0
"I have seven in door cats who I love.  I wanted try something that was less expensive and caustic than Revolution, Frontline, etc. . I used this three consecutive months.  Bio-spot puts some kind of a fur conditioner that began to irritate everyones fur.  Snowball's fur was so bad that she started ripping the fur that she could get to off.  The concept is great, but the delivery is not.  Most cats have sensitive skin.",0
"I like the flakes for my fish, and I switch up with this and the silkworm flakes.",1
I have been using this dog seat for a couple of months and like the way it sits on the counsel. It is also convenient for other items when my dog is not riding with us.,1
The hose broke after just one day,0
So much nicer than using bleach to treat my water heater. I don't see any difference between this and regular hydrogen peroxide. If it lasts longer and is more effective then I'll update my review. But otherwise it's convenient to get a large bottle of 7% h2o2; tough to find in brick and mortar stores,1
Dogs didn't care for it.,0
Did not hold up well. Certainly not worth the extra $$.,0
"Easy setup! Larger than expected, but great for my 10-11lb cat. He fits on every step but mostly uses the cubby. I attach some of his toys to it which is easy to do.",1
Very pleased! Fast shipping!,1
Everything I read about and A LOT less money than the pet stores or Wallyworld. Very well made. Nothing to put together...just unbox it and open it up. Perfect for my new Cavaliar King Spaniel. He weighs just under 18 lbs an won't get any bigger.,1
Items were what I ordered and am satisfied...,1
"The product description promotes this as virtually indestructible and for aggressive chewers so I was excited to try it.  Well, my dog (70 lb Doberman) did enjoy it- for about 20 minutes before he was breaking off chunks, so in the trash it went.  Expensive 20 minute play session... sigh.",0
"I liked this soap.  The smell is not obnoxious, it didn't cause dry skin.  The smell is not as long lasting at the original.  But I still like it.",1
"Its an intriguing and well made cat toy.  The Siamese kitten would only play with it in the dark and only after chasing mole crickets near the porch screen.  I guess it was too freaky for him lol.  However, again it was a neat design and large (footprint of a tennis ball).",1
"None of my cats would even eat these.  I even tried to break them into several small pieces since they are a bit big and hard.  They would snff them and play with them, but not actually eat them.",0
"I love this set of treat toys for my dog!  She is a pit/pit mix with a tendency to destroy toys but the first set of these that I purchased lasted two years!  And it wasn't my pup that destroyed them, it was the overuse and sun exposure that caused the treats to fall out TOO easily to be challenging for her.  She's back to being challenged with a fresh set.",1
great rotifers. delivered fast and alive!,1
Dog poop bags. What is there to say.,1
"i plugged the charger in once and then it was broke. The instructions talk about a green light mine doesn't have it. The charger is also different than the one in the instructions and on the video. Don't waste your money. Buyer beware.

How bout a refund",0
The rope toy was destroyed by my pomeranian in less than a week.  She never had much interest in the one you put in the feezer.  The other one she loved and removed all the stuffing immediately.,0
It actually works.  REALLY works and worth every penny.,1
"I believe the current (summer, 2016) product is defective. I bought 3 batches!!! (18 treatments) for my cats earlier this summer. When I opened the caps to apply the medicine there was no bad odor. Usually this product has very bad fumes which the cats hate. I thought maybe Bayer had re-formulated it. And the cats didn't mind it at all - usually they run and try to get it off!  I think there is no medicine but just liquid in these tubes!!!  it has been completely ineffective on my cats this time whereas it worked before. Think before buying this product in summer 2016.",0
"I've had good luck with previous orders of this product from this supplier.  However, we just had a problem with the first battery used from our last order.  It only lasted 2 weeks before it was completely discharged.  I had to replace it with the 2nd battery in the pack, and hopefully, it will give us the usual amount of use (4-6 weeks).  I don't see any date on the pack so I'm not sure if it exceeded its shelf life.",0
Great for brushing our dogs Oran's very easy to clean! We bought the one for ourselves and one as a gift for our daughter with her new dog. Dogs seem to like the way it feels. Highly recommend!,1
"I purchased this item for summer. I wanted to bring the new puppy on camping trips. Most sites in NJ require a 6ft lead at all times, if they allow dogs at all.  Well I read a few reviews that mentioned the carabiner gate flipping open. Well its no exaggeration! The first night (at home) of testing the leash, my 5 month old puppy was just sniffing this way & that way, not really tangling the leash, just twisting the leash like a twizzler. Next thing I know I'm holding a leash with no dog attached to it. Luckily my puppy hadn't realized this & was still nearby. I calmly walked up to him & put the leash back on. Thinking it was a freak occurrence, I gave it another chance. Well my wife walked him the next morning with the same result. FAIL! I can't imagine if this happened on the trail, he would have taken off in black bear country. This needs to be redesigned. I highly recommend the comparable Ruff Wear Roamer leash. I picked this up at EMS due to time constraints, and it does exaclty what I wanted to do. If Shockles can get a locking carabiner in place of the clip style than that would solve the gate problem. Otherwise good concept, poor execution.",0
"Hands free lighting operation once you get it programmed. Does not lose programming if power is lost. This is on a 48"" long 55g tank with live plants and moss. Plants are growing and healthy, after a few months of use! Great product!",1
"Am not sure, but my dog started having seizures after i gave her this stuff.. not sure but she was fine before i started to give it to her. In the right amounts required. Good luck in keeping ur dogs teeth cleaned...",0
"My 6 month old Havanese Puppy keeps getting out this Crate within 10-15 mins.
I bought this crate couple of weeks ago and got home the puppy last week. While I am still trying to Crate-train and potty-train the puppy, within 4 days, the puppy has figured out to open the locked crate within 10-15 mins of being inside the crate and then roams around the house and comes finds me wherever I am in the house. Such a hassle! Total disappointment.",0
Penn-Plax Cascade 600 is a great little filter.  I was looking for an internal filter that I could easly clean and not have to buy new media each time I needed to clean it.  It fills the bill.,1
Simple nylon leashes are one of the best tools you can have as a dog owner. These come in basic colors to match the Gentle Leader and Easy Walk Harnesses and are nicely priced.,1
"This box is attractive and easy to take apart.  It is HUGE!  I think three cats would fit in it, so make sure you have the space for it before buying!",1
As described,1
"We purchased this thinking it would be a pretty decent alternative to some of the more expensive carriers. We bought it well enough in advance, kept our dog (approx. 17 lbs) in it at home to get her used to it, and thought it was pretty perfect. The day before departure, one of the 2 zippers on the large compartment broke. Fine, there's another. We've arrived at the airport tonight and just made it through security (dog out of the crate of course). We put the dog back in the carrier and the second zipper has broken. Clearly this product is CHEAPLY made. We are thankful to our airline that they have pet carriers on hand to purchase... but this one just isn't worth the stress. Spend a little more money one the durable option. Zippers are important!",0
It isn't strong enough to keep on my dog. My dog just slips his head right out of it even though it is  a perfect fit. It would be great if I could keep it on him for more than 3 seconds....he thinks it is his personal pillow now.,0
Great buy!,1
My dogs love these. Stand up to a lot of chewing and tugging,1
"Best glow collars on the market! My dog
Have to take walks very early morning. Many times car A never saw us well in the crosswalk. With this every car has stopped chew looks like a beacon! A great safety collar truly.",1
"My kitty, Luna, loves these treats so much that she paws at the fridge door, hoping to get at them.  She's older and has a bad heart, so I like that she's getting her Omega 3s and that she's eating only pure, natural treats.  They also facilitate giving her pills; if she won't eat the pill wrapped in cheese, or whatever, I rub some of the dried salmon around the cheese, and voila...she'll usually eat the whole thing.  Then I'll reward her with a bit more salmon. It's pricey, but because it's only for occasional treats, I feel it's the least I can do for her years of devotion.",1
"I bought this toy with high hopes for my chew loving 11 month old puppy.  I bought the one for medium dogs.  She worn down the treat in approximately 15 minutes, and when she was frustrated she decided to go for the treat from the other side where you can insert treats.  In about 5 minutes, she had ripped a chunk of the orange rubber off the toy and then cracked the rubber along the portion that connects the everlasting treat side and the side you can insert treats.  I really expected more for my money than 15 minutes of fun for my dog.  She can no longer use the toy due to the damage.  Major disappointment.",0
my birds love it... it's a bit hard to clean when they got dirty because of the fabric... you have to wait until the boo completely dries off... GROSS,1
Very well made for the price...works great!!!!!!!,1
"Expensive, but if it keeps my dog from having an Inflammatory Bowel flare, well worth it!",1
This case is good quality and it fits my laptop perfectly,1
"My chocolate lab, Lucy, rips apart every toy she owns...but for some reason, she loves this duck, and it's still in tact since christmas! so cute :)",1
my dog had punctured this ball within 2 minutes and had it in small pieces within 10 minutes.... very disappointed that it wasn't more durable.,0
"Both of my cats throw up when given more than half a can of the Fancy Feast each per serving. At 1/4 can each per serving they are fine. They like the product, crave it I could say, but there must be something sharp/greasy in it that irritates both. I tried several times 1/4 to 1/2 can switch, and guaranteed, they both throw up. I can't recommend it.",0
"I bought three.  One never worked, one worked for a while, one worked for a while longer.  Now none of them work.  They are expensive, and they work for a short while, and then they don't work.",0
I've been feeding my two Guinea Pigs Oxbow Cavy Cuisine since I got them a few years ago and they still love it!  They are both super healthy on it and my vet approves :),1
"Too small, go up a size.",1
These are great quality my cat that normally doesn't play with toys has found a new love for these fish.,1
Having returned a previous air pump that died after a week I ordered this better one and am so pleased with it. It is so quiet that I don't hear it even when I'm standing a foot away from it. I think that you will like this air pump too!,1
"I do not recommend this collar.  It would spray my poor dog when he barked, sneezed, panting and taking a drink of water.. Useless!",0
My dogs' favorite nighttime past time. Nice large ears.,1
"Hartz Flea and Tick Shampoo in 12 oz, doesnt kill fleas like it says it will. Yes it will clean your cat, make it smell nice, give it a shiny coat but kill fleas? Not so much.

I had noticed some fleas on my indoor cat, we do not use regular flea killing products like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Advantage-Once-A-Month-Topical-Flea-Treatment-for-Cats-Over-9-Lbs-6-Applications/dp/B0002C737E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Advantage Once-A-Month Topical Flea Treatment for Cats Over 9 Lbs (6 Applications)</a>Because we rarely ever need to. So I bought this shampoo and used it and it didn't kill one of them, I even looked in the tub after I did it to check! no floating corpses. So I waited and waited a few days, remember this stuff is supposed to last awhile and keep killing the biting pests! It didnt.

I guess I will have to break down and get the expensive stuff!",0
I am not sure when they say medium what chart they are going by. This is very tiny {small}. I could see a toy poodle play with it but not my 17 week old English Retriever. Choking hazard. The rubber doesn't seem to be as well made as the one I had in the past so must be different manufacturer. colors are vibrant is about the only good thing I can say about this toy.,0
Very unhappy. Did not come with nozzle now i can't squirt it into my dogs mouth. Please send nozzle.,0
This ball is for our Bull Terrier 1yr old male....he has popped every other ball that he has had....This one he has NOT popped yet and we are thrilled with it and so is he!!,1
"OEM replacement, it's a Fluval quality component that fit like the original.",1
LOVE these. :) they help my dog not scratch us on accident and going to the in laws for Christmas there wood floor is protected. :) worth the buy. :) just make sure you get the right size. ;),1
"I've had this for two years now, and it is still working really well! I use a forever tray with it, and it really makes things easier.",1
Great absorption and size and the price is right.,1
This isn't white. It's regular sand.,0
"This stair is extremely sturdy and well made.  It was little confusing to put together because there were so many holes, it was hard to figure out at first and directions aren't that great.  My Golden Retriever uses it, but reluctantly so far.  He needs help getting in the car.  Have been using treats to train him on it.  When getting out, he mostly only uses the top step which is just the right height.  He is 7 years old and slow to new things but this will definitely help him avoid injury as he gets older.  Very light weight and fits easily in trunk of car.  Believe this is a better choice than the more expensive ones.",1
This product appears to rely on an attachment to work which arrived bent and broke after a couple of days. $20 for a useless can of air.  Not how I want to be spending my money.,0
"Perfect, really well made. My cat loves it. This one looks so nice and it folds up for storage, awesome! Thanks",1
"My dog, a 30 lb. moderate chewer, is pretty good at destroying even the toughest toys.  This toy has made it past the first hour and doesn't have a scratch on it!  She loves the fish and squeaks it quite a bit.  Even gnawing on it with determination didn't hurt the toy.  I continue to be impressed with this brand of dog toy, JW Pet.",1
"definitely not the right kind. was very oily, i would be aware",0
"Our puppy is growing fast, but this has been a great sweater to have for the last month. Even though she's almost too big for it now, the stretchiness of the fabric has allowed it to last longer than other items we've purchased for the dog. As a bonus -- it's a very cute sweater :)",1
"I thought this was a good idea but when I opened it two of the panels were bending in could not get it to stand up without the bend in the panels and there was a small rip in the floor.  I was going to send it back but could not get it to refold at all, so could not get it in the box to return.",0
Does not keep ants out of food at all waste of money,0
"the gentle leader seems to be comfortable and easy to use, and it really improved our dog (1.5yo lab female) as a walking companion.  She doesn't seem to mind it too much, though she does try to rub it off her face at times.  The part that goes over her nose seems to have caused a very small amount of hair loss due to the friction.  I'm hoping that I won't have to use the leader for a long time once she learns to walk a bit better, so I think the hair issue won't be much of a problem.  The purple color is great.",1
Cute for pjs,1
"Just received this cat condo today. I do not like it. I am having the hardest time screwing the top platform on. I should have waited to purchase one at Costco when they have them, it comes put together, same price. Damn. After I finally got the screws lined up and put in, they don't go in all the way, I wouldn't let my cat lay on top of the screws!! So for the second time I am going to have to try an take the screws out, put this back in the box somehow and take it to the UPS store. What a hassle!!",0
Is perfect and better easy to use,1
"Cats just go limp, and won't walk with it on.  I returned it.",0
"I will be returning this leash. The spring has 4 very sharp barbs on it, I cut myself getting it out of the box. It is made in China no surprise. It is too stiff, bulky and heavy. I also don't like that where the braided leather ends on both ends it is covered up by a leather sheath of sorts so you can't see how it's attached and it does not look too securely attached to the metal ring from what I can see inside. I don't trust it. I will buy one where I can see how the ends are attached and not covered over.",0
Got this leash on cyber special day and it was very $ cheaply priced but was pleasantly surprised that the quality was good. Better than small leashes at the pet stores.,1
"The leather was not ""durable"" as mentioned. Was destroyed with insides spewed in a matter of minutes by a Mini Aussie/Dachshund. Cute to look at, but that's not what dog toys are for.",0
"cool toy but lasted about 10 minutes with my Jack Russell, she is hard on toys but this one fell apart quick",0
"It's pretty but not made very well. The larger rhinestone fell off after a few days. After a closer examination, many of the smaller ones fell off also.",0
I have a dog who loves to chew and his favorite toys are the ones that squeak. I learned in the past he is very rough on these toys and I have to be careful when buying these toys that he doesn't choke or even swallow harmful things from these toys. I respect KONG toys in making good toys for dogs who love to chew. So I thought I would try these squeaker balls. These balls died on the first day. My dog had them torn apart in a matter of minutes. You may think I might have bought the wrong size and I have a large dog. I actually have a very small dog and so buying a large ball for him I thought it would harder for him to kill. I was wrong. Please don't buy this product if you cherish you family member. It is easily destroyed and the squeaker in this toy is potentially dangerous to your dog. I have found that the Chuckit! balls stand up to my little dog's mean jaws. Don't by buy the squeaker balls. Not worth it at all!!!!,0
Using for a 5 month old Cane Corso pup with warts in her mouth. This has completely helped boost her immune system!!,1
"I read quite a few reviews on various bird seeds before purchasing this seed. Some of the reviews on this seed said the birds won't eat it. For my feeder in Northern Kentucky the birds do come, but they throw out all the filler. It's quite a waste, and they don't come near as much as they did when I used the bird seed from Sam's Club.

I wouldn't recommend this seed for birds in my area.",0
Glass part arrived broken.,0
"My son is 5'10'' and skinny, 15 years old. It hits him at just below the knees, so he needs black pants, and that's fine. It looks perfect. On the picture it looks like it hits the model mid shin, and that's not exactly true for my tall teen. If you are shorter than 5'10'', it will probably be true for you! But again...no biggie. We are happy and it looks great. It's a smokin deal, too! So mom and son are both happy customers.",1
i just removed so much potential furball from my cats and it is a great feeling for me.,1
"The dogs like it and it does not work, I purchased three bottles and have used over one and a half without success.  I would not recommend this for dogs at all, wish I had not bought it and could get my money back.",0
So disappointed. I put this collar on my cat about 7 weeks ago and all of the hair on her neck is now falling out and very pink... I could tell her neck was bothering her and this is obviously the culprit. So upsetting. I really really wanted this to work!,0
Better than expected - Good work on name and phone number,1
Both my dogs love this product!..They don't run away when they see me coming with the bottle!,1
I have a cat with sugar diabetes and this is the only food he likes that is high in protein.  Happy I can purchase it.,1
My dog doesn't like her kibble ~~~ unless it's in this toy!,1
"Inside mechanism broke after about 30 uses with a 45 pound dog. Flashlight never worked.
Company stepped up and refunded purchase price. Thank you.",0
We were very happy with it. We have a 75lbs Plott hound. He does very well on retractable leashes. Today out of no where the retraction stopped! Bought in July lasted till December.,0
"was a tad difficult to put together, because some directions were sorta vague. Other than it looks like it does in the picture and is a great place to hide a kitty box.",1
"I had high hopes for this cage. Unfortunately the one I received was previously used. You can see where its bent in multiple places. Few bars were bent and had to be bent back with plyers. You could tell it had been put together before, all of the screw holes had paint chipped off and there were multiple scratches. I would have returned it but we are in desperate need of a cage for our two sugar gliders and did not have time or the money to purchase another from the pet store. Disappointed that a received a used product. There were also this dirty rust colored powder all over the cage. Not sure what that was. A few bars had what looked like chew marks from a previous animal. :( maybe next time it would be better to check the product before sending it out.",0
"I am very disappointed! Venus Labs used to make an amazing, magical product and it seems they have now changed their formula, along with their packaging. It no longer works!! Bye Bye Odor works better https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AK6CTK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",0
My cat loves it. She got used to it very quickly and now she sits next to it expectantly when it's snack time.,1
first night 5 big rats and a mouse ! We have chickens and this will rest assure our  rat problem will be diminished !,1
This little brush is very soft and will fit on top of little paws.  I've ordered several and use them every day.,1
"Does not work on our Cockapoo - but we're used the success of the Angel Eyes product (w/the dreaded Tylosin) which was amazing.  We used that powder 1x a week (at most) for YEARS w/out any health issues (our dog is 11 years old).  It's horrible now that Tylosin has been removed as nothing else works.  Our dog still has dark tear stains and staining on all openings that have a moist surface.

Would not recommend -",0
... but they just didnt! All three pups turned them down unfortunate and I ended up giving them to our neighbors for her pigs. The pigs LOOOVED them! :),0
"We still have it, and the puppy loves it, but you could see the foam underneath the fabric 1 day in. He also ripped one of the ends with a clean bite and tear.
A couple weeks later he's not quite so ""chewy"" and hasn't destroyed it still, so I still think it's a durable and worthwhile dog toy.  I'd buy him another after this one kicks it.",1
My dogs are supper crazy for these treats.,1
These new batteries never held a charge and they are expensive huge waste of money!!!,0
Awful- 2 sets of Betta fish died within days of using this food!  Be careful! They are smaller and lighter brown than the other dish food that I had been using.  Waste of money and sadly killed the fish!,0
"This product in UNREGULATED by fda standards and sources from CHINA. They get away with it because it's ""holistic"" I changed my cats food to this and w/ in a year she had developed a rare disease called cantaneous lymphoma. It has lead to cancer and her death.  BUYER BEWARE!!",0
My cat is 10 yr. old and this is the most playful I've seen her since she was a kitten.  She loves these toys and follows me around wanting to play.  I bought mine on a different site and a veterinarian said to put the toy away when you're not playing with it.  I do that and she gets so excited when I get it out.  I also like the ability to have one wand and interchangeable toys that you can clip on.  We have Kragonfly and Katarantula.  She love both!,1
Tried everything to get my cat to eat this - he is finicky but likes treats like Greenies. He would not touch these treats even when I soaked them in Tuna juice.,0
Thanks,1
Works great!  I tried many different mats/rugs as I have two (18 and 22 lb) Maine Coons.  We have a LOT of litter.  This stops it from being tracked all over the house and I wanted a LARGE mat.,1
"I originally purchased this as a means to help train my dog to quit his excessive barking. I saw the great reviews, and thought this would be just the thing.  However, once he received the initial shock, he would yelp, and then it would shock him again and cause him to yelp again. This would continue until I removed the collar, leaving him into a sorry, whimpering pup with no idea what just happened. The zaps, even at the lowest setting, were way too strong. Not only was it ineffective in this manner, but it would also be set off by his moving and jumping, or any other sounds near him. This lead to constant beeping and shocking. I was horrified, and now have reason to believe that the reviews were purchased. This is junk, and the worst product I have ever purchased.",0
"I couldn't be more disappointed with the battery life of these things. We needed to change these out on a dog's anti-bark collar every 2 days from 5-10 growling/barking incidents per day. I recommend purchasing a different brand instead of wasting money here on what ""seemed"" like such a good deal.",0
The design of the little jar sucks. I use hot water knife and almost hurt my hand. I still cannot open the jar. I will not purchase it anymore.,0
My dogs love these and I try to only use them when training them.  They last a long time and 3-4 pieces is all I recommend.,1
This product is colorful but evidently for much younger puppies then what I have. My 6-mos-old Shetland Sheepdog successfully detached each individual ball and then went and tore open the main ring to get to the cotton stuffing. Chocking hazard.,0
"I waited 6 months to write this review. It was worth the wait. Here's why...

I had taken my dog to our vet twice due to her licking ""down there"". I suspected it might be stones, was told there were no signs and sent home with an ointment. Last November when I took her to the ER for a heart condition, they did an X-ray and by chance saw there were stones in her bladder. I was upset that my regular vet hadn't taken my concerns seriously before. But... here we were. I'm dealing with a 12-year-old miniature schnauzer with a heart condition, not exactly a candidate to put under anesthesia to remove stones. Dealing with stones became my second priority.

I did my research online and found this product. Read reviews. Decided to give it a try in December 2017.

I proceeded to give her the correct dosage with 30 days on, 7 days off. I repeated this for four months, until April 2018. I took her back to her veterinarian for X-rays. THE STONES WERE GONE. In May, she turned 13. To say I was relieved is to say the least.

She started seeing a holistic vet (get one if you have the means) in May. Interestingly enough, this vet has never heard of Chanca Piedra. I explained what I was doing. I wasn't going to stop.

I took her off Break It Up in June (it's mid-July 2018 as I write this) and she's started licking again. As I've done my research - and perhaps you're doing the same - it seems that even humans take this as a ""maintenance"" supplement to keep bladder/kidney stone issues at bay. And perhaps that's what I will continue to do with her. Because it's been four days now since she started taking Break It Up again, and the licking has all but stopped.

If you're still reading this, you're likely like I was. Researching and praying there's an alternative to surgery. It's a natural supplement that's sustainably sourced. My advice? Give it a try, but make sure you give it a few months to work. See if you notice a difference.

I never saw blood in her urine as so many other reviewers had; it was completely her licking that tipped me off that something was ""off."" But using this product and adding water to her food (holistic vet's advice there to make sure she was hydrated and could flush out any stones) has been a potential life-saver for Chloe (first time I'm using her name here!).

My only caution for you, as the pet owner. BE PATIENT. This is a natural diuretic. Your dog or cat WILL need to use the bathroom more. And that's what you want! I expect when I have her on this that I will be getting up around 1 or 2 a.m. for a potty break. And I'm OK with it. I wouldn't want to have to hold it if I had to pee. Please make sure you're available to let your pet out throughout the day so that they're continually flushing their systems.

It's key!

I hope this review was helpful. And I truly hope this works for your dog or cat.",1
"Very fast shipping, item as expected!!",1
Our older cat is thriving on this product.  Excellent ingredients!  She is gaining weight and eats on a regular schedule.,1
The extra small for our Pomeranian very well. Washes well.,1
The size and design allows ease in cleaning.  Side locks work positive don't release until they are released for cleaning.,1
Super cute and my cats love it! Bought a second one!,1
"I am not hear to turn consumers away from Sentry products, as Sentry is an industry leader in providing quality products. Although, this product in particular is dangerous and almost cost me the life of my pet. The clasp on the collar is not designed to release incase the pet is snagged and being choked. I found my cat hanging from my dresser handle fighting for her life because the collar got snagged as she jumped down and wouldn't release. Thank god I was home so I found her in time. I hope Sentry passes this feedback onto their product development team to consider methods for improving this product.",0
My dogs got sick with these and they normally do fine with bully sticks.,0
"I purchase several of these over the years, I'll never forget when I got my Colby and he was just a few months old he loved it and I couldn't find another one. Just before this purchase I I bought a smaller one and it's great this one on the other hand does not stand up it is very bent and only Falls over so it's a little disappointing. Kind of wish I had purchased the horizontal log instead",0
Thought it would last longer.,0
Very large full sized pig ears-My dog is in heaven as he loves these!,1
"After our nightly walk, Mia headed straight for the pool before I got the collar off. She only gets on the top landing of the pool stairs in about 6 inches of water, but she likes to put her head down and snap at the water. That did it. I even had the little sliding ""door"" over the charging port slid closed tight, AND had the small clear plastic cover (that comes with it) over the whole battery part, held on tight with a rubber band. No good. Needs to be more water protected.",1
"I've tried so many cat mats.  This one, although I like the design of the pass through holes, it isn't big enough to give enough coverage to be effective.  I still had cat litter all over the hallway.  Even using two mats didn't stop this.  (I did find a mat that does stop the spread of cat litter) I like that this particular design makes it hard for the trapped litter to escape the mat once you pick it up, unlike other similar designs, but the mat was super slippery on a tile floor.  It did fit under the door however, which is a plus.  I wouldn't buy again though.",0
I must  have mis-read specs or reviews because thought I had puchased a solar or battery operated light.  Wasn't expensive enough to bother returning.  I might give it to a friend or use in an outdoor fountain later.,0
Really liked the idea of this bed - recycling old clothes items and assumed easy wash/care.  The reality is that if you stuff this sack with old clothing it becomes a very heavy and lumpy bed.  Since the stuff sack is a netting material I'm not sure what a good filler solution would be.,0
"It worked great for 2 weeks-until it rained outside & I found out that it's not as ""weatherproof"" as they claim. Now it doesn't work at all.",0
all as advertised; I'd buy again if the need came up,1
The roof hinges are not all that great. I use if for chickens and I had to cut the opening to make room for them.,1
Works well and is easy to replace. Refills last me about a month.,1
"We got our first bag from the vet. The price is comparable on here, actually just a little less, and they are delivered right to our door!",1
"I love these things!  I have had my for 3 years Joey since he was just 3 months old and in all that time he has been riddled with anxiety.  The only place he has ever been comfortable enough to be affectionate is on my bed- I couldn't even pick him up without his entire body going rigid and him struggling to get down.  I found these treats at Petclub and after a week he is no longer hiding in my bedroom, but is out in the rest of the house, sleeping beside me on the couch, and allowing me to pick him up - briefly - without struggling.  And he loves the way they taste!  Looking at the reviews it seems like if your kitty is willing to take them they work quite well, but there seem to be enough kitties out there that are unwilling to eat them that its kind of a 50/50 shot - still well worth trying if your kitty has anxiety in my opinion.",1
I was eager to try these out because two of my cats were suffering from eye problems due to the effects of a giardia infection...however none of my cats will eat these. I'm really disappointed because they appear to be pretty healthy!,0
Good Toy !  2 GSPS and play tug of war and not wreck this one ! Only thing better would be if it made a noise. They Love noise,1
"My dogs love all of Claudia's offerings. You can tell it's a good product because it is frequently sold out on Amazon. I wish it was less expensive, but I trust the ingredients, so they get these on special occasions.",1
It's cute but does not work at all - my cat easily escaped right away.,0
"Runs a little small, but it's stretchy.",1
Way too small,0
"The reviews for this collar are pretty evenly divided across the board. No one product will make everyone happy, but in our experience this is worth the money. The older cones were rigid, opaque, and hard to keep closed. This one is strong, pliable, and clear. The snaps aren't too difficult to fasten, but we have to snap them firmly. Once we do, the collar doesn't come off until we're ready. Just hated having to put one on our dog, but her hot spots were never going to heal unless she could not get at them. She can get to her water and food dishes, however.  Bessie is an 80-pound lab so we got the XL, and it is a good fit. She likes to jump up on the bed, which doesn't bother us. The first day she tried to do that with the collar on, she couldn't. So, she decided she needed to go into the hallway and get a little running start. Cute. This collar is easy to clean and very durable, and because it lies flat we will be able to use it again as the need arises.",1
My dog loves this stuff.  We switched from a much less reputable brand (previous owners had him on it).  His coat is so shiny now you can almost see your face.  He seems like a much happier dog too.,1
The hand-carved Rosewood Urn was exactly what I was looking for to keep my beloved cats ashes in at home. It is very well made and beautifully carved. The delivery was fast so I had it by the time he came back home to me. Excellent customer service too. I highly recommend the Pet Memory Shop!,1
The only problem had one of the receivers come off the collar and got lost.,1
They are easy to use and work like a charm!,1
The size of the tank is fine but the filter system doesnt work. The water I poor in just gets dirty.,0
"My lab golden 2 1/2 month old puppy who is under 20 pounds literally ripped the front door wall off to get out. I had tried to remove the wall two weeks prior and could not get it off, so the fact he could shocked me. I only usd the crate a few ties and owned it for less than 30 days.",0
My very big red-haired slider loves warm water and this heated his tank to a perfect 68. Great and efficient!,1
"My dogs absolutely LOVE these and looked forward to getting one each day as I left for the gym. HOWEVER....they are made in CHINA. There are so many problems with pet foods made in China being VERY HARMFUL, if not death-inducing, that, even hough I'd not had any problem with these, I am not willing to take the chance. Please, makers, have these made in the good 'ol USA!! I will start buying them again, and my dogs will be thrilled!!",0
"I've been researching these collars for several months now and finally settled on this one. So far I've only had it three days....and it's AMAZING!....lately my dog who's a 1 year old husky/golden mix, about 55lbs....has been going on non stop barking fits....no matter how much I've tried to stop or correct him w/ sprays etc...nothing would stop him for more than 5 minutes.  The 1st day I got this collar I didn't put it on him right away.  I waited until he went on a long barking fit and put it on....at first he was more curious as to what the heck this thing was around his neck.....after about 10 minutes of that he let loose his 1st bark...the collar beeped..then zapped...he immediately stopped and sat in the corner of his kennel....not a sound for the next 5 hours.  I took the collar off at night because he's generally good late at night.  The next two afternoons I did the same thing...and the results were exactly the same...This thing really really works...and all it took was 1 zap from level 1 correction....I can also say that it didn't affect his disposition or mood at all..he was still very playful and acted like his normal self....minus the barking....I'm very pleased w/ this so far!",1
"My dogs have been on Petsmart brand for 6 mths. I switched to this because of price. Yesterday I found 2 ticks not just craling on my dog but b iting him. Good meds, no biting ticks.",0
Dog loves it,1
This leash has held up longer tnan any other retrackable leash i  have bought at PetSmart or Walgreens,1
Didn't work or help at all. I followed the directions perfectly.,0
Great for a small fish tank.  The only problem I had was that the moonlight light fixture was not working properly.  It would not stay on daylight for more than a flash. I could not return it for a replacement because I had fish in it already.,1
I have a 25lb. mutt and this fits him perfectly. It is very adjustable and secure once you get the fit right. He doesn't like the water normally and went right in off the shore with this on. He has also fallen off the side of the boat and floated there until we could reach him. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a water shy dog or one that is on the boat a lot! It came just as pictured and described! We are very happy with this product!,1
Thought I'd give these a try since the ones at our local feed store are so pricey.  These are super thin. My three dogs would go through one each in about 20 min.  They break apart into shards which one of my dogs decided to eat whole. She spent the next three days throwing it up. Definitely wouldn't recommend.,0
Dog doesn't wanna eat,0
"When I opened the box containing the cans, there was a horrendous stench.  I have cleaned up after both babies and cats, and this smell was far worse.  Something also began to drip out of the box when I started to remove the cans to see where the odor was coming from. It went straight into the garbage.  I think perhaps the cans that have the top you can open without a can opener may be popped more easily.  I (or my nose) didn't really want to investigate any further.",0
Chips apart easily hazardous to dogs,0
This item was placed with the fragile item and it was broken,0
We have zebra finches and it's frowned upon to use string as nesting material. This box was all string. We did put it in their cage but they almost always ignored it and went straight for the Heritage Farms Bird Nester nesting material. It's much more natural.,0
"After buying this product I am very disappointed.  Everything was covered in plastic, awful amout of waste going to the landfill for no good reason.  Then I find out this thing doesn't come with a power supply.  This was supposed to make my life easier not add more hassles.  Charge $5 more and include power, so annoying!!!!!!!!!",0
Bad for your dogs teeth,0
"My year old cat is not picky at all when it comes to the litter box, but no matter what type of litter I use (and I have tried scoopable, regular clay, pine); she does not cover behind herself. In the past, it has been such a pain to try and keep it scooped behind her, that inevitably the bathroom started to smell like cat urine. With the Breeze, since the urine drains through the bottom, it is no big deal at all for whoever is in the bathroom to quickly scoop and flush solids, and the pads have so far been lasting about 12 days with one quick rotation halfway through that time period.
  While it does seem as though there are not very many pellets, for my cat who will not really cover anyway, it is not a big deal. I had no issues transitioning her to it- we actually moved in an 800 miles, two-day car trip, I set this up for the first time as soon as we got to our new home, and within 2 minutes she was using it.
As for the cost on it, I did get it on the goldbox special, which helped a lot with the initial costs. I had been looking to get it since it came out, but did not really want to spend upwards of $40 for it, which is how much it was running in local stores. I have not yet had to purchase replacement pads and pell",1
Quality.,1
"All that follows is still true, but the price has doubled since I last ordered. It is simply too expensive now.
Keeps the odors down without any nasty scents. Clumps well and has less dust than clay. The only thing that made me rate 4 stars instead of 5 is that my cats seem to track it around more, even with a mat.",0
meh,0
Fleas still alive and kickin'...,0
"Collars seem kind of sensitive no matter the setting,  collars would go off if my dogs would shake themselves off after rolling on ground.",0
The first time my cat climbed on this pieces of carpet just started falling off making quite a mess. Since it continued to 'shed' I had to put it up. I had one of these for years that went through the use of several cats and it did not start falling apart until it was nearly shredded. Needless to say I am not very happy with this purchase. i will shop at the pet stores for a replacement where I can see if the carpet is properly attached. Sorry Brinkmann you need to improve your product.,0
"Mine came in a battered box without a test tube, the ph scale, and the instructions. So now I have to go out and buy a test tube and a scale. Thanks for the battered box and bottles.",0

love it,1
"This review has been delayed, largely because after using this product two or three times (unsuccessfully) I stored it away. The brush itself seems constructed well and the pins are well-anchored. However, at least on the brush I received, the ""Flex"" feature seems to mean simply that the brush is not secured adequately to the handle and, instead, rolls around uselessly in circles as I try to brush my dog. She has soft, curly hair that is approximately 2 inches long and regularly brushed. I did not try to rake out deeply-entrenched mats with this brush; rather, I have simply attempted to use it as a finishing brush... to no avail. While some rotation would be acceptable, this limply rolls around and, within two or three passes, the entire brush comes out of the handle! It is absolutely useless. Last I came across the previously-stored brush while looking for another one of my dog's grooming tools; because of its otherwise seemingly good construction, I might try gluing the brush into the handle? That does NOT seem worth it to me. Too bad. I had heard great things about this brand.",0
"So I bought this because I usually like PetSafe toys and this looked like it would keep my dogs busy. The premise looks simple enough, put a dog biscuit in, and they work to get them out. But, no matter which size of biscuit I put in, the dog just bite them off at the edge of the toy, and the rest of the biscuit gets stuck inside until I push it out for them. Ah well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.",0
cats don't like it. :( will pass it on to a rescue organisation.,0
Fell apart after 3 days.,0
"No i didn't buy one--saw it at the store. I walked outside the store and found one lying on the ground. It is called a stick, comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, densities. You would find them if you actually walked your dog. Utterly amazing what we've come to when you pay money for a stick.",0
Very cheap looking after we got it. No cushioning.,0
"Loved it at first and so did my pets, until the motor burned out in 9 months.  My wife and I clean the water dish twice a week which also involves a thorough cleaning of the motor.  I would not recommend this product for this reason alone.  Hopefully this vendor realizes the issue with this product and will upgrade their fountain motor.

Update to my previous review:
Disappointed with this purchase.  The pump went out in the first 6 months,  but the seller did replace it at no charge.  The filtration system does not do a good job at filtering out debris.  It collects in the corner of the bowl, as shown in the picture.
The fountain has to be full almost to the top or it makes a sputtering/ chugging sound.
My biggest complaint is that it is lacking accessible filter replacements.  In the Q and A section a question is asked about where to buy replacement filters, which is followed up by a comment from the seller that they are having issues with their supplier and recommend another filter that belongs to another product. I searched for hours to find a filter that I thought would fit but it didn't.
I will be purchasing another pet fountain from a different vendor.
I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 due to the customer service,  not the product quality.
The product description also states 100% satisfaction guarantee. I'm not sure what that may mean in terms of reimbursement.",0
"The piece of foam I received was NOT reticulated foam, shipped from China and not suitable for aquarium use. More like common furniture/packaging foam. It was also not the thickness stated in the listing. Buyer beware!",0
"It goes together just fine, but there are a couple things that could be improved:

the ring at the top has tiny holes all over it. This is so that the hamster can breathe, obviously, but it becomes a problem when the hamster pees up there.

The outhouse part is okay, except that the door is at an angle, which makes it tough to open.

The wheel is fine. It is especially nice if you have a smaller cage because it attaches to the outside. It can be a bit squeeky, but we just spray a bit of cooking oil into the center bar and it stops.

The entire thing (except the wheel) can be difficult to get into place tightly so that it does not wiggle.

Overall, the wheel is the most useful part of the kit.",0

My Pom had trouble chewing this and then it became soft and got stuck in her fur then she TRIED to swallow the whole thing. Thankfully it was hung up in her fur and I was able to pull it out before she tried swallowing the whole thing. Not recommended for dogs that inhale their food. I also feed her TD Small Bites by Science Diet (small bites but still rather large kibble) so that she's forced to chew her food.,0
My dog really likes this bed.  he is an 80 pound lab and I have had no issues with the seams.  It holds him a bit like a hammock and he seems much more comfortable than laying directly on the patio.,1
"The only thing good about this product is that it might save you money on dog food...cause your dog will be full from eating the stuffing. My wife's little boston terrier ate not only the first bed but the second one they sent as their ""warranty""
Do your self a favor, throw a cheap sheet in the kennel if they're a chewer, cause the tuffest thing about this is the price.",0
This product has a poisonous toxin in it called phorin. My dog has had a couple of seizures and kidney problems which my vet said was caused by these poisonous tears made in china. Don't buy them or any other Chinese made treats!!!,0
No good! Made my fish sick! Great customer service though!,0
"Our Betta fish took a little time to get used to it (maybe a week), then decided it was ok.  The hole in the top does allow for conveniently dropping food through which did encourage our Betta to go into the log.  After about a month, I think the Betta can take it or leave it now though.",1
Works well. Wish it had separate buttons for the different modes rather than having to cycle thru the options.  Fortunately the vibrate has been enough and have not needed shock.  I feel that even the lowest shock setting is too high to start at. Battery life is very good.,1
"It does not work.  Tried it for a few weeks, eye stains still there.  I won't  order this again, very disappointed.",0
I'm very disappointed with the fact that this item does not clip on the handle of a standard retractable leash. Very few of my clients use anything other than a retractable leash so this product turned out to be a waste of money.,0

"This is perfect for a large bag of dog food. The container is airtight, and the lid opens easily. When closed, it remains nicely sealed keeping the food fresh. The casters roll nicely making it easy to move the bin around in your garage/storage area. Easier to buy on Amazon and have delivered than driving to the local pet mart.",1
"One major flaw: the unit resets itself regularly, requiring the removal of the batteries on the collar to pair remote and receiver again. It does this almost every use. I would avoid any collar using the same reomte control unit pictured, as they all appear to be from the same manufacturer. Returning.
This would get five stars because it does the job, but there are some stupid flaws with this design. First, this is the same collar as sold under various brands here -- most are the rechargeable type. My experience in using this and reviewing it is based on using a different shock collar that broke after six years.
Flaws: 1 -- these have 100 levels of... whatever. You know that scene in Spinal Tap when Nigel is talking about their amps and says ""The numbers all go to eleven. Look, right across the board, eleven, eleven, eleven and..."" I imagine that the design meeting was like that: ""This goes to 100. People will eat it up."" Totally unnecessary. Reading the reviews of other similar collars this seems to confuse people. The levels should be from 1-10. That's it, that's all you need. So think of the 100 levels as 1-10. And you probably won't need to go very high: on my 90lbs Ridgeback I use the vibrate or shock function between 20-30. And I use it rarely, because this is a training tool. I'll get into that later.
Second flaw -- no power switch. It just shuts off after a preset time of less than a minute. That means you need to hit one button on the remote to wake the thing up and then press the *action* button to use it. Stupid design. Let me turn this on when I put it on my dog and turn it off when I remove it. My old collar worked that way, didn't go through batteries all that often (once a year, if that).
Now I'll talk about how to use this, because reading reviews on the other silmilar collars there seems to be some confusion.
--This needs to be tight to your dogs neck. Tight enough that it won't move around as they run and play. If it's loose, it won't work properly.
--The sound/tone mode. I've read complaints that it's barely audible... True. You will barely hear it, and only if your dog is next to you. It's a tone designed for dogs to hear, not humans. Your dog hears it just fine.
--How to use this: It's a training tool. I first started using a shock collar on my Ridgie when he was about 18 months. His recall was nonexistent when he found people with treats at the dog park (quick rant: don't bring treats into the dog park. If you need treats to keep your dog under control at the park, you need to do a better job of training your dog. And not at the park.). And the police told me I couldn't use a taser on the people, so the dog gets a shock collar. My old collar had two buttons, tone and shock. I would hit the tone button and then hit the shock button. After about three shocks my guy recognised the tone as his corrective measure -- no need to shock. Then I would whistle before I used the tone button. Pretty soon he recognised that my whistle meant he was doing something wrong and needed to come back to me. A bit more difficult with this unit because you most likely need to press the button to *turn* it on, press the action button for shock, press the mode button to switch to tone, press the action button for tone. But it can be done.
When it comes down to it you should rarely need to use the shock feature. And very rarely use it at a high level. Walking in the woods and spotting a cougar and your dog wants to chase it off would be a good example (and even then it may not do the trick, speaking from experience). But use this as a proper training tool and train your dog to respond to other stimuli, chances are your dog will behave simply by having the collar on (I had a friend use a collar on her Ridgie for a while. After it broke she just taped a couple of washers to his collar where the box used to sit. The weight made him think the collar was on and he behaved.)",0
"Our Blue Healer named Apache who by himself started running after Frisbees' and jumping in the air and grabbing them would go thru about 3 a year. We play everyday weather permitting. Sometimes I would notice blood so I started looking for an alternative and came across this Booda Tail-Spin. From the description it sounded like just what I needed. I wasn't sure if it was big enough to match the old one. When it finally arrived I couldn't wait to test it. It was big in size and matched the old one. Throwing it was just as easy. It has enough weight to fly parallel to the ground while he runs and jumps after it and yet light enough to float. The material is soft on his gums and haven't seen any blood yet. He bites it and chews it when handing it over to me to throw again and it holds up. No holes, rips, or tears. Washes easily and dries quick. When I tell him to go get the frisbee he runs into the bedroom and chooses the Booda over the Frisbee and brings it back to me so we can go play. When we finish I tell him to put it back and he returns it to the toy box then goes and lays on an a/c vent to cool off.",1

"My dog liked the small of the treats that go in the bone but they are so narrow compared to the rest of the massive plastic bone that my dog wouldn't even attempt chewing and believe me, she is highly food motivated. The treats should be wider to better tempt dogs to begin chewing. The ends of the bone are made of a very hard, heavy plastic that was unappealing to my girl- and I didn't blame her. The product sounded like a good idea but I was disappointed in this clunky waste of money.",0
"Product does not ""Grunts, squeaks & rattles"" as claimed.  The last six of these I've purchased only ""Grunt"".  Previously the ones I purchased did grunt, squeak and rattle.

After setting this up on a Saturday we found out that the system itself was defected I would never recommend this product to anyone it does not work the batteries came dead so we went and bought new batteries and tried it out thinking it was only the batteries after installing everything correctly and putting the new batteries in the collars the Beepers on the colors wouldn't work properly they would make the sounds that it was supposed to but would not Shock my husband and I tried it and my kids every color we got was defected I would not recommend this to anyone this is a horrible product and I highly regret ever send him the money on this system what makes it worse is when we called it in the customer service was awful and we could not get our money back,0
"If you don't count the side flaps as part of the size, why count the top flaps. I still feel that the 69 long is misleading because I measured my car with seat down and it still does not fit all of my back space",0
Product working as advertised,1
"Terrible quality, broke after 4 days.  I purchased this to replace the exact wheel I purchased for my hedgehog 3 months ago.  The first wheel (same make and size) broke after only 2 months of use when the peg that attaches the wheel to the base splintered and the wheel would no longer attach for 4 days.  I broke down and bought another a week ago to replace this product because my hedgie liked it so much, but the exact same part broke this time after only 4 days of use.

Terrible quality, same part broke in the same way with both purchases.  Do not waste your money, just buy a metal wheel.",0
it works well it works well it works well it works well it works well it works well it works well It sucks big time to have to write 20 plus words next time I would say nothing.,1
"These little guys fit perfectly in the crevices of ""Puppy Kong teething stick""... while I don't have the other toys I would imagine it would also fit well in any of the Kongs that have ridges suited to the regular Kong stuff'n ""pastes""... however, these treats, being solid and not paste, make our puppy actually chew on the teething stick, rather than just lick it a bunch.  Which is great!  So big thumbs up from me.",1
"My second Bio-Wheel filter, first was a 150 model.  Same exact problem with both models, after about 1-2 months the wheel stops turning altogether.  The 150 i had to cut a hair comb to fit in the reservoir and raise the output flow of the water so that it actually hits the wheel with enough force to turn it.  The 200 just stopped this morning after slowly grinding to a halt over the last 2 weeks or so.  Just changed the filter.  So now I'm on my way to Walgreen's to buy another hair comb (I use hair clippers, pretty short hair).  My advice - save the headache and spring the $$ for a better filter.",0
"Extremely perfume fragrance, makes the pet smell awful after",0
"Poor Instructions, Poor Design.  I have an older door with previous design and coated nylon screen which had same problems.  I drilled holes through the frames of both old/new doggy door designs to clamp the exterior and interior frame pieces together and prevent it from falling apart.  Good quality black coated nylon screen is too thick.",0
"Got a tiny dachshund? Do they love to tunnel? Yeah they do. Tired of wrapping your poor sausage dog up with a towel? Give them this. Instant love. Super cute, too.",1
Feather is cheap plastic. Not what I expected. Will use it with other attachments at least. Just feels cheaply made.,0
Dogs love em!,1
Broke as soon as I got to the dog show. My show dog almost got hit by a car in the parking lot because this think broke as I was walking her from the show ring back to our camp out. Not very satisfied,0
Omg addddoooooorrrrableeeee 4th of July fit well made,1
Sorry.  It seemed like a fantastic idea but it doesn't work.  It looks okay but doesn't hold on to any kitty litter (we use Tidy Cat. maybe another brand would work better.). I wish I had waited for some comments before I bought this product.,0
"Without question, the best brand in the market for dogs.  The difference in my dog's health, coat, teeth, ears and energy level on this product versus others in undeniable.  I will never switch again.  They don't have gas, their digestion is excellent, their coats are shiny and clear, their teeth are beautiful (my vet comments every time she sees them) and this product keeps them lean and strong.",1
"Absolutely love these, almost as much as my dogs love them! They work great in the water too. Highly recommended! They aren't made of steel, so the dogs need to be watched because they can chew them up pretty quickly, but two of them play tug of war every night with one, and they hold up better than expected. They've killed a couple of them by pulling the rope off the bumper, but the bumper is still fine to play with.",1
It didn't heat up for nothing,0
These are awful!! About 20% of the bag is twigs and sticks. And they are not even real Black Oil Sunflower seeds. Not sure what kind they are but the finches will not touch them. Very Disappointed.,0
"I also have a ferret age 2 that experienced months of stool problems with the change in the original Wysong Epigen 90. He ate orig Wysong for over a year and when I heard of the change, spoke to a representative asking for the orig. She assured me the change was minimal and sent me sample.  I ordered two big bags and before getting half way thru one bag noticed stool changes so bad and frequent I had several vet visits, to check the problem.  After antibiotics and probiotics that did not help, I realized wysongs change of formula, by the vet asking me about food changes.  I  than took this change of formula (Wysong 90 in blue and green bag)away from my ferret.  After months of probiotics and putting my ferret  on a fast for two days, giving him only a canned prescription cat soft food from the vet for two days that he hated,  I finally gave him 2 varieties of totally ferret and continued probiotics.  It took a few months but I was delighted to see his stool finally back to normal.  I still use the other varieties of Wysong such as digestive health but threw away a whole bag and more of this Wysong epigen 90.  I might add, I have 2 ferrets but only one would eat the Wysong changed product.  That made the conclusion clear, since the sick one ate it and other one did not.  The high quality of protein makes Wysong a great food.  It's sad they put ferret owners through such stress over a formula change.  They had a great food and they changed it!",0
"My dogs eat it, now they have more energy, and a healthier coat, also they have a lower body odor.",1
My cats love these!!!!!!! I feel they are very high quality as well.,1
My dog didn't take to eating the product. i am sure its healthy but my dog threw up after eating it at first. Then she has to almost go hungry before she will start eating it and then she only eats a small amount. for some dogs it may be great but for mine she didn't take to it. it's expensive to find out your pet has a hard time to enjoy eating it.,0

These balls only lasted about ten minutes in the mouth of my young adult Dobe girl.  She promptly started to ""skin"" them.  She swallowed fabric that she pulled off the balls so I grabbed them up and tossed them.  If there had been a solid or one piece hollow rubber ball under the fabric, I'd have let her keep the actual ball but the fabric held two half spheres of rubber together to form the shape of a ball.  These Squeakair Tennis Balls are a total waste of money.  I expect more of Kong!",0
Worked ok when it was working. Failed in 3 months with very little use.  Kudos to amazon for giving me a refund on this china crap.,0
"Please, please reconsider before you purchase a Fluval 406 filter; I'd rate it negative stars if were allowed!

I purchased this unit in December of 2012 to replace 20-year old Fluval 303 which ran, and ran only to find the 406 completely unusable. The filter would continually simply stop running. I'd thoroughly clean out the filter, clean the impeller well and the impeller, fill the canister, remove any air, plug it in and nothing but a humming noise.

I'd open it back up, do nothing other than take the impeller cover off and put it back on, seal the unit and plug it and it would run anywhere from 10 minutes to 24 hours before just stopping. There was no air bloc, the impeller shaft was in great condition etc... I'd replace the impeller, ceramic shaft and well cover anyway and I still could not get it run reliably.

The ONLY think that worked for me was to use the impeller from my old Fluval 303 in the 406. It would at least run but with less water flow than my old 303 filter did.

Calls and writing to Fluval (Hagen) were left unanswered; thanks for nothing Fluval.

I've since replaced the filter with a AquaTop CF/UV model (they make a 300, 400 and 500) and I'm so far I', very happy with that. The only way to tell that it's running is to watch my plants move, quiet doesn't begin to describe it. The media trays are at least as large as the Fluval 406. There were some features of the 406 that I really liked but if doesn't run, features mean nothing.",0
"Easy to assemble, very hard wood, nice size and not too heavy for its size.  Solid construction such that my two 51 pound daughters can sit on the roof together.  No apparent fading or degradation after three months of use.  The dog house is relatively inexpensive if you consider what you get.  It is also relatively easy to clean since the floor is removable from the housing.",1
I had high hopes based on reviews. I wouldn't say I hate it... but the cat does.,0
"We got a medium for our 1 1/2 year old male cat and it was just the size we needed. I put it on the cat one Saturday morning, let him get used to it and then opened the bedroom door to let him jump on the bed with my boyfriend, who was asleep, as a surprise. It worked well! The outfit stays on but the hat is a little harder to keep on. We've put it on him a few more times as well.",1
"Product came super fast. I love the fit for my 7 year old, 36 lb Cockerspaniel. Based on all the reviews about the sizes may be a bit small I decided to purchase the large. Fits him great!! I love the length of the bootie because it's harder for it to fall off his feet and it protects more of his leg. I hate the muddy rain and most boots only fit up up to a certain size. The travel big is a huge plus!! Helps me keep up with them. Up until now, I've kept other booties in a plastic bag, lol!.",1
"Is small that I expected. I been wanna return it. To exchange it into bigger. I wonder how can I return. Don't get me wrong it's great the signed, I wonder if there's is bigger sized.",0
Excellent quality! Super fast delivery.,1
"If you are looking for a litter box that doesn't look like a litter box, then look no further!  Super easy to put together!",1
"I am constantly looking for good interactive toys for my 45-pound lab mix.  She loses interest quickly in plush toys of any variety, and hard plastic toys (like the Tug-A-Jug, made by the same company) make a frightening amount of noise on our hardwood floor.  She hides from the Tug-A-Jug!  This toy is her favorite, though.  We fill it with crumbled beef jerky treats and she will gnaw on it and toss it around for fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. It seems to be a good mixture of texture and treat-dispensing for her. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it's challenging to clean...food gets stuck inside of it and can be hard to remove completely.  Soaking it in very hot, soapy water periodically does a good job of keeping it from smelling bad or growing anything funky.",1
"The kitties love to play with this, kicking it, swatting it, and batting it around.  They lay on it when they are done.",1
OK,1
"My birds loved playing with this toy. It was alittle tough for them to figure out how to get the treats out at first, but the figured it out.  It was easy to put together and put the treats in.",1
I have a Chihuahua and wanted smaller pads because these are too big and we waste a lot of wipe. Will definitely go back to my old product once we use these up. These don't have a nice smell and I love it when my dog smells good.,0
"Another excellent cat-approved purchase! We never had a cat tower before and we wondered if they'd like it ... they love it! The price was great and the quality is excellent. It was fast and easy to put together (even though we had lots of cat help). It also seems to be the perfect size - doesn't take up too much space, but gives they plenty of room to enjoy all the features.",1
"I love Parisian Pet shirts.  I have a 6 pound chihuahua that has a broad chest and the small fits him perfectly.  It took ordering an x-small to see that a small size fits him best.  I have seven of these shirts, they wash well, and fit under wool Chilly Dog sweaters in the winter.  They are dried fully so they continue to fit him.  The fabric is good quality, the embroidery is well done and they are totally worth the money. Thanks a lot, Parisian Pet!",1
Opened when we received it. Spilled in box.,0
So  quiet I love it,1
This has garlic in it!! Customers beware. I bought this before I realized there was garlic in it- garlic is not good for most dogs AT ALL.,0
"My credit carge was charged almost $5 for an international fee. WHAT????!!!!

Yep, this is an international order, your fees may vary.

My dog loves the squeaker in the balls.  He is a power chewer so they don't last long.,1
Was good quality but not a slip lead......  It was a regular attach to collar lease.  I returned it.,0
"Smells like a skunk :(
Not relieving her itch. Disappointed all the way around.
Wouldn't mind the smell if it was helping her.",0
I got this to help my little old lady feel better because she's getting arthritis. It was a good idea in theory except that none of the 4 cats will eat these. A couple of them will lick the treat to be polite but will wander off as soon as I look away. One of them thinks eating the bag is interesting but the treats are a no-go.,0
Gave both of my dogs gas. Need I say more?,0
"The width and strength is just right for my reluctant, aging lab; however it is very heavy for an aging women (me) to lift.",1
"Lots of bulk -- nice large, solid blocks -- but still only took my Green Wing a little over a week to turn into much. ;o)  Good toy for the $$$, though.  Certainly better than going to the local pet supply chain store and paying nearly $50.00 for something my macaw will either ignore or tear to pieces in two days.",1
Don't assume by the price that you will get 3 packs of treats like the other sellers are offering. This is a deceptive picture of the product for sale.,0
"Well, my 9 month old GSD has an obsession with a fuzzy stuffed soccer ball she ""stole"" from my smaller dogs...she plays with it all the time yet has never even chewed a hole in it. She is NOT an aggressive chewer at all, her toys last a loooonnnngggg time. Well, she loves playing with this ball but she ripped off the soccer etched shapes in no time flat.  Total waste of money for a ""sturdy"" toy labeled as ""tuff"" when it is clearly not...",0

Small adjusts from 8-10""
Medium adjusts from 12-18""

My cats seem to like it.  I'd say it's good for the money...,1
"Works very well. However, it is only good for kittens. It is sooo small. A good portion of the interior is used to strain the litter when rolling. But it does work great, if the size suits your cat. I don't really know any adult cats that would fit in it.",0
Fits my 11 pound Schnauzer perfectly.,1
"Our dog seems pretty happy in this sweater. The leash ring is nice and seems firmly attached. The sweater is not really stretchy at all, so make sure you measure carefully. My one constructive criticism is that the arm holes are a bit big and could be made smaller if the sweater had a zipper, which would also make it easier to put on.",1
cat is not interested in going in the tumnel. material is good.  i thought I ordered one for my address.  I sent another to family and their cat would not go in.,0
My dog love this stuff.  I even sneak a few nibbles in too.,1
Bandit loves them!,1
My small dog chewed this up the first day she received it.,0
The item description claims this can be used on a Guinea pig. It is very much too big.,0
"Thank you MKT for a beautiful product. Very well made and attractive stitching. Thank you for a surprise coupon too, I ordered a second one for another of my pups.

I definitely recommend this product. Very nicely made.",1

My cats love this! Makes them think and work for treats.,1
"Canidae is a new dog food I'm trying and I purchased this brand and type of food because of the ingredients, not because I thought my pets would like the taste. Of course I want them to like it, but you can disguise poison to taste good. So I'm investing in products that will give my pets a longer, healthier life and so far Canidae seems to fulfill all of my expectations. No fillers, whey, excess preservatives, gluten, corn, and corn dextrose, and meat fillers (Where this could cover from diseased animals). So keep it coming Canidae, I will continue to use their products if they keep the quality of food high for my pets.",1
Good product.  Satisfied.,1
Love the design & size. Wish it had more cushion inside.,1
Grows easy would recommend this product.,1
Looks just like picture. Well made.,1
Didn't do anything for my dog.,0
This does nothing....it is stupid. I was an idiot to buy it. If I could return it I would in a heartbeat. Lesson learned,0
"My neighbors puppy was barking and whining incessantly. Had the product up for about 4-5 hours and haven't heard a peep from next door. Even though it has been less than 24 hrs. ,I can say with confidence it's worth it's weight in gold. I also have 3 dogs and with the thing pointed at the neighbors, it didn't affect them at all. When I put the battery in I tested it in the house and my 7lb dog ran and hid until I turned it off and took it outside. It doesn't recommend using it on dogs under 8 pounds.
Oooops",1
good buy a little smaller than i would have like for 6 pound poodle i cant remember what size i bought small?,1
This is the second reflective collar I have ordered from this seller. The first I purchased almost two years ago and was in perfect condition- the only reason I needed a replacement was because my dog got skunked! People give us compliments on it all the time. The writing is very easy to read and the reflective background is very visible at night. I highly recommend this collar!,1
I have two rats. Not even ONE rat would fit in this. It's way too small. Disappointed.,0
Needed a gate for a new puppy.  This gate is very easy to install.  Pressure sensitive pads avoid any drilling requirements.  Gate feature is excellent.  Check opening width requirements to determine if you need any extensions.,1
I sent this item back.  It did not fit my dog,0
My puppy loves these guys!,1
Wonderful mat. My kitties absolutely love this . Best order yet .,1
Excellent product. Excellent price. Yes the water collects under the dish because it's not open but simply wipe it with a paper towel. The stand is tall enough and sturdy so that my 138 lb lab/newf mix does not tip it over.  I would buy it again and I would give it as a gift.,1
Broke right away,0
Amazing how much hair comes out with this brush.  I haven't used the expensive brands but I could not imagine getting any more hair with them.,1
"This is one of the worse inventions I've seen so far on betta 'tanks'.

The myth is that bettas can ""Thrive"" in a little bit of water but in reality the bigger, the better.  Bettas are naturally meant to live in rice patties and yes the water is shallow BUT THEY HAVE MILES TO SWIM AROUND!

This may look like an oh so amazing thing but would you want to be attached to the wall hanging on by a nail or so?  If you want a betta fish GET A HEATER http://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-06107-Submersible-Aquarium-150-Watt/dp/B003C5TMU4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1349757537&sr=8-1&keywords=aqueon+heaters and get NO SMALLER THAN A 2.5 GALLON TANK!  Because you're heartless human if you think a betta would enjoy living on your wall and without a heater.  80 degrees in the best temperature for a betta.

SO hopefully someone will read this and think 'Oh how could I be so dumb to think that my betta would actually want to live in that?!' they are simple keepers for those who are smart enough to care.  Get a 2.5 gallon or bigger tank with that heater (set on 80 degrees, 50 watts works as well) and make sure to feed them frozen food (bloodworms are their favorite) or very good pelleted food (New Life Spectrum) and you will have a healthy and happy betta.  You'll also HAVE TO CHANG THE WATER every 3-5 days in tanks between 3.5-2.5 gallons.  This wall tank seems like a wonderful idea but imagine having to take it down every 2-4 days?

So DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE A HEART AND SOUL!  Fish are very misunderstood but just because you cannot hear them doesn't mean they're not upset.",0
This is a really good tool to clean your pets with. I didn't notice this was for cats so I can only use it on one of munch dogs but the product itself is perfect. I'm very big  critic when it comes to reviewing products but I have nothing bad to say here.,1
"Very unhappy.  I don't know how these are prepared, but these two bags are going in the trash.  Although they have not expired, they look like they were 'baked' too long.  They are brown and have a very coarse texture.  The shame is that these are my dog's favorite treats.  He will do anything to get one.  He sees the bags so he is begging now, but he won't get any because I'm afraid to give them to him.  Not happy with this shipment.  I buy these at least once a month, but I have to rethink this.",0
"My cat is very small so I have to make sure it is tight, but it has sure saved me.",1
"My son's cats sent my cats a squirrel Skinneeez for Christmas (I know, I know!)..I opened it for them today! I have 2 cats that are 10 yrs and 1 that is 7yrs. When I opened the package, my first thought was ""Huh?"" That was the last comment I was able to make before the toy was mobbed,licked, and shaken by my cats! I have no idea what there is about it, but it's better than any catnip I've ever bought! These are senior cats and they were acting like kittens! Within 5 minutes the thing was icky with saliva! One cat is paw-popping another to claim this toy. They groom it, hunt it and really,really love sleeping with it! I've never seen a response like this from them over anything!
Only one word of caution...I did have the noisiest cat brawl ever over whose turn it was to play with it!

Great product!,1

best treats to be able to educate my Husky. And her dog friends from the park also love them,1

"I have a 10 year old purebred Husky Shepherd mix. Her coat was always dry and itchy, and I followed my vet's advice for Nature's Variety Grain Free dog food. It took some time, but this food was amazing! Shedding subsided substantially, skin itching stopped, and all was well. Simply put, do the research and see how good this food is, and see how well-formulated it is.

There is so much junk food in the pet food market today, but Nature's Variety Instinct formula has the proper ratio of protein to fat and is grain free. Similarly, the company doesn't seem to pander to what the average pet owner assumes that dogs need to live well, which, of course, is often wrong. All and all, this is the best made pet food for the best price I have found. Certainly, it is more expensive than the pet market leaders or the big retailers' house brands, but it's a wonderful balance between price and quality. Your pet deserves the extra to live a long healthy life.",1
"The product took a WHILE to get here. It shipped from China!!! Luckily I knew all of this, but I'm impatient still. The bed smelled pretty funky upon arrival. I let it air out a bit before my puppy climbed inside. The bed is exactly like the photo! I cannot get my puppy out of the bed now. Love love love. So glad I decided to buy it!",1
Very well made crate that folds up easily.  The tray comes out too.,1

AS SAID,1
"I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle! I will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when I get home. I will never, ever buy another Hartz product again!",0
Lasted about .5 seconds.  Cute for what it is but if your dog chews at all this will be punctured and shredded fast.,0

"I have a 25lb Blue Heeler puppy.  I bought the size 0.  It's a tiny bit big on her right now, but she's growing fast.  It still works perfectly though.  It is extremely easy to put on her.  I love that it has a handle on top.  I've needed to grab her a few times already, and it's handy for helping her in and out of the car.

I did order new patches for the side, because people kept calling her Julius.  (Plain reflector strip patches, but they have many to choose from)",1
The GP haven't touched it once since I bought it -_-,0
"This is a fun toy.  Even though it is designed for cats, humans enjoy it too.

Due to the displacement of the weight inside (just the right amount of weight), the ball wobbles different directions from what one would expect.  Every movement is a surprise keeping it interesting for cats.",1
"My cat is very picky with her toys, she loves the foam balls, she can play with them for hours and hours, that it is why I ordered 2 packages of them but I did not received what I ordered. I ordered the soft balls, just like the ones in the picture but I received an open style ball with a jingle bell inside and feathers stuck on them. My cat has zero interest in the toys I received and try to returned will be even more inconvenience. If your cat will like any kind of ball to play this will be great, if she is picky like mine wish you luck to receive the correct product.",0
"My cat love these toys, I've been buying them for her for about a year now. She likes to play rough with her toys and these fish take about a month to get chewed open before I have to replace them. They used to cost $7 for two fishies, not sure why the price is now doubled. $14 for two is a pretty ridiculous price for something like this, I will be buying other toys until the price goes back down.",0
"Excellent product, works great",1
Very flimsy and not very sharp,0
Not that impressed. Doesn't stay cold for long and when it starts melting it gets everything around it wet . My dog wasn't a huge fan either.,0
"Not a big hit with my cats, especially if cold.  The oldest cat sometimes leaves it even if not cold but the youngest kindly finishes it for her, eventually, at least when it warms up.  Since they have  all-day access to kibble (Blue Buffalo) and mice and squirrels I don't worry about it, and just give them a tablespoon full or so, for variety.  Note:  All three absolutely refused the chicken flavor.",1
"I have never been so disappointed in a product like I was about this dress. I bought it for my teacup yorkies birthday and the dress is really bad quality and does not look anything like the pictures, I don't even think its the same dress. The stones are falling off and some are missing.",0
"Claims it can fit cats up to 21lbs. My cat is 7 lbs and this door is waaayyyy to short for him. It only sits about 8"" when all is said and done but the actual hole is only 6""...very misleading and poor description. Maybe a hampster could fit though.",0
"I purchased a bunch of Basics Cat Food, and the treats, since I have a cat with chronic intestinal inflammation. I had hoped that it would help him, consistent with information online, and in advertising for this product, but he became very sick. I had to give him a lot of prednisolone to get him back to normal. (His normal. He must have prednisolone and Pepcid AC daily. The Prednisolone saved his life...) This is very expensive food, so my suggestion is that you buy a small bag and try it on your cats - my enthusiasm got the best of me and I bought two bags, one large, and many bags of treats - oops. Well, the only good news is that my other cat will eat it. However, I have to feed it to her, and then immediately hide any that remains in her dish, so my sickly cat can't get to it... I introduced it to my sickly cat as a small supplement to his regular food, but when I got to about 25 percent Basics, he became very sick...
I do not recommend not buying this product, but as I stated above, I would try a small bag first.",0
"My dachshund was dragging his rear feet. He couldn't do anything but lie there. My wife and I felt so sad for him. We had to carry him outside to do his business then carry him back in again. I already bought joint supplements for my mother in law (MSM-Chondroitin) so I knew that these products were designed especially for joint issues. We bought the NaturVet Arthrisoothe for our dachshund and went with the double dose as recommended for the first month. He could walk again, and he even gets excited and can run on occasion. He has been on this product for nearly a year now and is doing great. I have just ordered my second 16 oz. bottle (they last forever for small dogs) and when I was ordering my next bottle I saw nothing but a so-so review of the product and felt I must speak up. He loves the taste! I mix it with his dry food and he does not want to eat without it. Thanks NaturVet! We were so concerned for our pet's pain that we did not know how much longer we could have gone without putting him down. We are going on one year now and couldn't be happier.

Update: 10/08/2009
Well, our little doggie passed away in April just shy of his 14th birthday. However, our sadness was tempered by the quality of his last year of life. We believe the NaturVet Arthrisoothe made all the difference. You'd think I work for the company given the glowing review I give, but I don't. It was just so sad to see him helpless and in pain, and the NaturVet Arthrisoothe gave him the ability to live life. I haven't had the need to give it to our new dog, but the way he jumps around he will no doubt need it some time down the road. One last thing, the 16 oz. bottle lasts a long time for a little dog, so you get your money's worth. Best wishes to all you dog lovers!",1
"The filter clogged up quickly and the clear water quickly turn cloudy. Turtles are messy creatures and so far a large canister filter is the only thing that works, but I had to mouth suction to prime the filter.",0
"So far so good! Our 9 month old eats so fast, she actually would choke on her food. We've had this for a few days, and I'd say it has slowed her eating down to maybe 4x's her usual mealtime! The only negatives are this really works best for dry food as she tends to flip the food everywhere.",1
Very small I will order again tho alot cheaper than pet stores.  Also same brand,0
Kitty cat didn't care very much for this flavor.,0
"Great product, applicator Is aweful.  Sprays backwards most of the time and you will end up covered in silver instead of what you are aiming at.",0
"This has wonderful ingredients and my stinking cat will actually eat it! I wish it were less expensive as he's eating a full 6 oz can every day, but I guess you have to pay for quality.",1
CATS!  more money down the drain.........  but I love him  :),0
"I bought 2 of these things - recommended from others who showed their dogs playing like crazy on face book.  I bought one for my dogs and one as a gift.  The one I tried for my dogs:  The ball that held the batteries was pretty difficult to get apart but we succeeded with a long skinny Philips head screw driver.  Got the battery in, got the ball in the pouch.  Shook the thing aggressively (as per directions), pushed the button, as per directions.  No lively tail.  No nothing.  Did it all over again.  It reacted for 5 seconds and went dead.  I replaced the batteries with others, thinking maybe they were the problem - but I had just purchased them.  Nope.  Nothing.  I am not sure if the button is supposed to stay depressed but I tried everything.  I gave up and have not tried the other one.  I will say that the ball inside that holds the batteries is very rigid.  My springer has very strong jaws. He grabbed the thing, and I was afraid he would crack it open - even though it was in the furry pouch.  I may try again, but not too soon.  Maybe I got a toy that was made on Friday at quitting time?",0
My female cat likes to back up to the very edge in her litter boxes. The high walls on this one keep the urine inside the box.,1
"This product is pretty useless. You may as well dump a half cup of cat kibble on the floor. I have it cinched down to the smallest hole possible but the kitty kibble pours out and you end up with cat food all over the floor. I bought the largest kibble I could find, to try to make it work. No good. Very sad.",0
They love this.,1
"My dog loves this bed, well made.",1
great item!,1
great for swimmers,1
"She loves it. No issues with gas, diarrhea, itching. She has a beautiful, shiny coat and lots of energy.",1
These batteries never worked for my dog's collar. Don't buy this. Waste of money. The return window was one month so No opportunity to figure out they were all dead or never had a charge.  You get what you pay for-lesson learned.,0
"The fountain leaks constantly. Even when running low, it leaks. I have to switch out kitchen towels on a daily basis and cannot fill it so that there is a pool of water on top. I can only fill it up so much that the pump doesn't run dry, otherwise I've got a pool of water on the floor. I will be searching for another fountain.",0
worms can't get out but my sugar glider was not easily able to get them out either.,0
"One of the things that I really like about this collar is that it was pretty much a plug & play deal.  The instructions were easy to follow and other than getting confused about correcting which dog when (purely a human error on our part...no fault of the collar or the training remote), we have had zero issues with it.

We have 2 very rambunctious dogs; one is a 3 year-old lab/border collie mix and the other is a one year-old golden retriever.  The collar works wonderfully on the golden retriever.  He has stopped some of his more obnoxious behaviors and rarely ever needs reminding.  I take the collar off of him every night when he goes into his kennel because there is zero reason to keep it on him.  I also clean the prongs off and inspect his neck to make sure he doesn't have any sores, burns, or other ill effects other people have noticed.  So far....absolutely nothing to cause any concern.

The collar does not work on our lab/border collie; however, that is not the fault of the collar's manufacturer or the seller.  Our poor boy was rescued as a puppy and was severely traumatized.  We aren't sure what all happened to him; we just know that he is extremely sensitive to some things and it took several weeks to earn his trust when we first brought him home.

He didn't like the feel of the new collar and then when he was corrected (just a beep) it scared him.  He tends to bark like a crazy fiend whenever my husband comes home from work, and I hit the beep function and it didn't faze him, so I used the vibration on a low setting and that terrified him.  When I tried to put the collar back on him the next morning, he was so upset that he urinated all over the floor.  So....I would not recommend you use the collar on a dog that has been traumatized.

An interesting fact for my two boys is that when I correct the younger dog, the older dog responds also.  If the collar beeps, they both immediately stop what they were doing that caused the correction.  So, I guess technically the collar works for both!

The collar is well made, holds a charge for a couple of days, is easy to use, and provides gentle correction.  All in all a great buy. The collar itself is made of plastic; but that is easily changed out if you don't happen to like plastic.",1
I really like this,1
"Smelled like rotten and tasted same disgusting. Dog smelled it walked away. I the same,will donate the rest.",0
"Not only do our two cats love this, they actually play in it.",1
Turned the water red. Very weird.,0
It doesn't do a thing for my short haired pup.,0
It's exactly the same as what we replaced except for the color. Works well. Easy to clean. My furry friends approve too.,1
Please do not put a fish in here. The general rule with tank size is that 1 gallon per 1 inch of fish. That means a betta needs roughly around 2.5 gallons when fully grown. Make sure to do your research.,0
I have pit bulls with tummy issues. They loved the taste and no gas 1/2 hour later as I have had with other brands.,1
"We bought this for our Great Dane puppy figuring he will grow into it and want him to have plenty of room. We are very happy with it. It was not hard to install, but for us it took three of us! It is sturdy and we expect it to last a long time.",1
We purchased 2 Furminator brushes small and large they have been a blessing on the fur problems created from shedding.  We saw this vacuum attachment in Petsmart and decided to purchase it hoping to get better results than from our Bissell Shed Away which does a great job but quickly realized how cheaply made this furminator attachment was.  We tried the large brush and small brush but found the cheap velcro loop just wouldn't hang onto he brushes and worse yet the setup for sucking the hair in just wouln't work.  This is going back to the store and maybe they will create a quality attachment later..=ired of being a Beta Tester if you know what I mean..,0
Got this for my Russian Winter White hammy along with the Kaytee Ceramic Critter Bath for his sand baths. :) He LOVES it. He runs into it and spends so much time rolling around in it and digging in it. Best money I've spent in a while!,1
"We got this clawguard for our dog for when she is in the basement while we are away.  It took her about 5 minutes to pull it off the door, and no amount of Velcro or adhesives were going to help.  The material is nice if the dog cannot get around it and pull it down, however if you have a clever dog, think about another solution.",0
"The title says it all. I had just sent back a brand new Eheim 2076 for leaking after 10 minutes of operation! I figured it was a fluke and was excited to get the new unit, but that excitement quickly turned to absoloute disgust. I sent the product back to the dealer.

I decided on a Fluval FX5 and have been very happy with that purchase.

As an aside, I was able to use the Eheim mechanical and biological material in the Fluval FX5 and the Eheim material is performing its duties well (keeping the tank healthy).",0
This stuff works great at controlling green hair algae. It was a big problem in my marine aquarium and it has prevented it from returning. The water is crystal clear.,1
"I read so many reviews on Amazon regarding this product. I buy my pets Timothy Hay from Kaytee brand at Petco. They barely eat it and it ends up at the bottom of their cage all the time. I am tired of spending my money on crap hay. So after reading the reviews I decided for the 3rd Wafer cut as other customers said this was the best hay and thinnest cut. I went to their website and too noticed the difference in the pictures between all the cuts and the 3rd wafer cut looked green and very thin. So I ordered it expecting the best. I received a box today, the HAY was really thick  and lots of dead brown weeds. I dug further down in the box and all of the Hay has brown weeds and the hay is sooo dry it barely has any smell. I want a refund and I will not be ordering again. DO NOT BUY THIS HAY!!! The pictures are false advertisement. I have attached images to back up my claim.",0
I found it east to install and it kept the feathers and food in the cage.  Not much to it.,1
"Product description stated 220v-240v. But when I received the power adaptor, it indicated 110v input only. Looks like product can be use in USA only.",0
My cat loves this salmon flavor ONLY.,1
My dogs are so happy with this small bite food.  It is even small than the Nutro brand I bought in the past and it makes it much easier for them to eat.,1
My dog has a sensitive stomach.  This product has done a good job to regulate my dog..,1
Great product easy to place on chickens,1
"There is a bad product link on Amazon.  The link for Ethical-5-Quart-Mirror-Finish-Stainless sends you to a one pint bowl.  I tested it several times, and someone needs to fix it.  Amazon's labyrinth of choice and links do not show a clear way to address this issue, and I don't feel like running the maze today.  I am leaving this as a warning to others not to rely on the search and purchase or 1-click purchase functionality at Amazon.  Since this is only a $4.19 purchase, it is not worth the extra time to negotiate a refund.  My lasting concern is that I cannot get to the 5 quart version; the one pint is too small for my dog's muzzle.",0
"My cats won't eat the deep water fish flavor - even if i leave it out for them.  and they aren't too picky, they eat most quality wet cat food.  the feral cat ate it though.

I've read where the other California Natural flavors are better accepted by cats than this one.  My cats love fish best, and this one was not tolerated, so i cannot recommend this particular food.",0
Very nice and sturdy.  I am very satisfied that I purchased this!,1
I started fostering kittens and need a pen to house the need arose.  This is spacious and worked extremely well.,1
"My 3 y/o rescue cat is 12 pounds but far from what I'd consider big. She really likes to sit on the second level (she jumps straight up... The stairs aren't helpful). She tried getting in the little cubby once but doesn't fit. She refused to try the hammock and only got in the basket once. She hasn't figured out a way to get to the third level but seems to enjoy the view when I put her up there. It is the perfect height for me to brush her without having to bend down. I really believe that if she had this as a kitten she would have climbed all over it and would still enjoy it all as an adult cat. Knowing what I know now, I would likely still make this purchase. I do wish that the hole was on the third level because it is easy for her to jump from the floor to the second level but then she doesn't have a way to get higher. It was pretty easy to put together but the box was heavy.",1
"Our dogs love these treats and they're so healthy, they can have several a day!",1
It was a really bad buy maybe a third of it actually worked,0
Although it said large my 12 lb dog could not fit in it. I returned it.,0
It has a terrible odor that will not go away.  Bought the 4 quart and did not have any problems.,0
Ordered several of these and several did not work,0
"Best device ever, Pet has to be in a harness, One end connects to child safety buck in between the cushions of your back seat, The steel looking buckles, I never knew what they were for, now I've made use of them, The other end clips to your pets ""D"" ring harness, where leash normally clips. The strap is adjustable for your pet, Mine is set so that he may stand, sit, lay, but cannot get in between the front seats to effect my driving safety. I have one on each side for both of my bullies. In a slow speed collision, I have no doubt this travel harness would keep my pet safe, in my opinion, and at a high speed collision, it's anyone's gamble anyway. When in town traveling to pet smart, the vet or simple errands, My pets love to go for car rides, and this was the only way I knew to keep them safe, and not impair my driving safety also, I rated it 5 stars, Because it's such a life saver.",1
"My dogs weren't a fan. Apparently they like slumming it with beneful. But as far as I could tell it was a well made product with good ingredients. First shipping went well, second the bag was busted.",0
"I purchase one of these collars several months ago. Would not suggest buying this product. Have had the collar about 4 months. The power button on the remote stopped working after the second time I charged it. Well I just had it in my dog, set the remote down for a moment, and 2 seconds later, my dog starts screaming. He was being shocked repeatedly until I was able to catch him and remove the collar. The button was not stuck, I will no longer be using this product and will be contacting the manufacturer.",0
"The bowl is really shallow, which causes my cat to be unable to drink as much water she wants to.  Either the water falling back down so often scares her from drinking or it doesn't come down at all (mostly the second one).  Now I'm just using one of our regular bowls and it works much more practically.",0
"This is a nice basic collar.  Easy on and off, adjustable.  Great price - purchased only for a temporary, as our Lab puppy quickly grew out of it, so it was great that we didn't have to spend alot.  Served it's purpose and still looked like new when we passed it on to friends who just got a new puppy.",1
Too big for easy scooping out of my seed bin.,0
"I first encountered a similar product in the Life Balances program. It literally saved my life because, unlike most people, my system is too alkaline and I'd lost  a lost of weight from not being able to digest my food. I'd read a book called The Alkaline Dog that explains this syndrome & what to do about it. I took the Am. Chlor. for decades with no further problems. Then that manufacturer stopped making the original product, and I found the SENSEable version online. It's almost identical and have been using it for several months now, and it has worked for me like the old version with no side effects except health!",1
"I had some damage done to my home during the Halloween storm and some animals got into the crawl space. I didn't discover it until the weather got warm and the stench started to come up into my living space. So I filled a few extra large tea bags with some of this zeolite, and dropped  them into my heating ducts, under the grates. I never thought of it again, until I realized that I haven't smelled anything in weeks. It must be the zeolite that fixed it. It can't be anything else. I had better order some more now, before the price goes up.",1
"Good fountain.  A little noisy, and needs cleaning every week when it gets slimy.

4-30-16 - Reviewing this again, and bringing the rating down to two stars.  Mine sprung a leak in the back, and now I can't fill it all the way without it losing water onto the floor.  If you don't fill it nearly full - you get a VERY loud fountain.  Would not buy again, will probably re-purpose the pump into a different water system.",0
"We have been through cheap cages years ago which is always a problem. This cage was so nice that I purchased a smaller Crittertrail cage and extra tubes and our new teddy bear hamster seems really happy. Its made well and has the good water dispenser with the metal nozzle. The wheel is nice and he loves it. I just ordered a bunch of hamster treats from amazon so he will be set up well and be happy, which is all that counts.",1
"I used Safe paws my drive and it was a real disappointment and embarrassment.  It killed all the grass immediately next to the drive ( which ultimately had to be replaced). When I used it on the walk, it killed the groundcover adjacent to the walk. I used less then 2 lbs over the entire winter.

It is so toxic to plants, I am concerned about its'  effect on animals.  Beware!",0
My cat is not interested in this at all. The cat nip they send you is definitely not cat nip. My cat didn't even want to go near it. I have 5 year old cat nip toys that he still loves and this does not compare. Returning.,0
"After reading the majority of these reviews being strongly positive, I ordered the trio of treats. I have switched my own diet to grain free and was especially pleased to see a company specialize in treats made with real meat products. When my order arrived, I excitedly tore open the salmon package and was assaulted by a strong chemical odor. I've kept cats my entire life; I know the odors that appeal to cats. This odor assaulted my senses. I expected my cat to turn up her nose at it and walk away, which she did many times over. And my cat is not picky! I'm stunned about the chemical odor. Nothing natural at all. I may return this 3-pack, unless it turns out not to be cost effective. What happened, Blue Buffalo?",0
"I purchased three for our outside kitties that their mom brought to our front porch last August. I was hoping they would love them, but these beds are, hand down, their favorite place to cuddle on chilly nights. They often like to snuggled together in a single bed. I have washed them and they launder well, but the fluffy outside does trap some residue that is difficult to remove. No problem for me as they are outside beds. I am more than pleased with the quality and will order three more when these are headed for the trash bin. (We have spayed/neutered all the kitties that we feed. Please spay/neuter all your pets. They and the neighbors will thank you.)",1
These are great! I love the price especially for 3 of them! I'm so glad it has the reflectivew part all around the collar too.  The only thing that I didn't like about this was that I had to stretch it out all the way for it to fit around my cats neck....he does have a big head/neck though but still if you have a bigger cat too these may not work,1
Poor quality. They aren't any stronger than a normal 99cent tennis ball. But they're 3 times the price of one! Go with the Kong ones!,0
"We used this product very happily for about 2 years.  When I came home yesterday, my dog was shaking and couldn't get off her bed.  One toe nail on her hind paw was stuck in the hole on this thing.  She had been scratching with her hind leg and got it caught.

We were gone all day, and it seemed like she had been stuck like that for several hours.  She even peed on her dog bed and had to lay in it.  She was also overheated, even though it wasn't warm in the house.  No permanent injury, but it took her several hours to recover.

I am just putting the tag directly on the collar from now on.  Not worth the risk!",0
The seller switched them for some disgusting pumpkin spice gimmick treats the dogs won't eat!!!!!,0
"Dogs detest it. Stops barking almost instantly!

Very easy to use,1
"All of us are happy with this new litter box, it is a little bigger than the Litter Maid, but more importantly, it cleans the clumps out so much better!  They do recommend a better litter that clumps better and stays clumped, and we got that as well, and love it!  And it doesn't smell because it stays clumped together, which was better than the old backing soda litter.  The cleaning is better than the old litter box, which broke every year, just about when the warranty was up.  We had to change the bag in the middle of the week, and still will, but this one is much easier.  The  bags that come with it and that we will be buying, will let you change it 2X a week, for a year for only 14 dollars.... The entire family is happy with the new box, it cleans better, the new litter truly stays clumped and it is easier to use.

Edit:  The bags that Amazon links to the product in the listing ARE NOT for this product, they are much smaller bags used while walking your dog.  Should have read the reviews better.  Don't know if I can send them back on Amazon's dime or not but it is a bit deceptive.",1
My pup went through the red dot Goughnut quick! But this yellow one is holding up strong. Very happy with it. Finally a toy my dog does not go through in a few days.,1
Too stiff for my maltese. Maybe for a bigger dog.,0
Molded after one day of watering... Did not have any excess water in bottom container or anything. Very unhappy with purchase. :(,0

"These did not work for my dog. He usually takes vets best allergy pills but amazon was out, so I tried these plus they were more affordable. On them for three weeks and his nose was running terribly and I could see he wasn't well, ordered the vets best allergy when they came in stock- allergies under control within three days...everyone's different so they may work for your dog, just not mine. Plus he wouldn't touch them unless I wrapped them in a pill pocket. Stinky in a medicinal way- not a dog delicious way-",0

"Very sturdy, Our dog started using it immediately.  The carpet pads help eliminate skidding.",1
"My son's cat loves the stupid thing and our cat looks at it like we have just insulted her cathood and walked away. The silly mouse has two setting... on constantly or an on for 3 seconds and the off until it is bumped and stays on for 3 seconds and turns off until bumped again. This on for 3 seconds was a comedy routine that gave us a memory to last forever. The cat hated it so the mouse got left sitting on the kitchen floor. The husband, not knowing it was there, accidentally hit it with his foot and set the dormant mouse into a 3 second run which ended just under our refrigerator. He bent down to get it and he bumped it which made it travel deep under the refrigerator. He went again to grab it but it got stuck and he pulled its tail off and it took off again for another 3 second run. The he got a yard stick to reach it but every time he would touch it, it would start up again and run like a real mouse would. The cat sat and watched him battle for this stupid, hexbug mouse for almost 10 minutes until it was finally captured and tossed in the garbage. What an event. It does not run on carpet. But like I stated, my son's cat loves it and won't leave it alone.",0
For the price of a ball I really expected it to be tougher.,0
"I have three dachshund pups and this works great for us and the pups.  The waterproof zip-in floor works well, easy to clean so far.

Pups love it and let's them see us and what is going on around them.  Positive experience for the pups and us.",1
This frontline did not effectively kill ANY fleas on any of my cats. I was very disappointed with this purchase!,0
fits our large GSD. very well made product and highly recommended,1

Did not receive 100,0
Very very bad!!! They treats are extremely old and I threw then in the trash!! Would not give that poor quality crap to my pet. Will never buy again.,0
Doesn't work on different channels.  Channel 2 controls both of them channel 1 does nothing.,0
I have a miniature dachshund and she loves riding in her car seat. She weighs about 12lbs and is a perfect size for her. If your dog is any larger it may be too small. Unless she is in her carseat she cries in the car.,1
It won't stay snapped and the guineas pull it apart and off their cage  It was a waste of money,0
Very nice harness but not very durable. The ring broke off from the harness ring holder.,0

"I purchased three cat bags to use instead of the typical crate, which were used for a long distance move. Two of the three cats complained for the majority of a 1000 mile trip. The purchase was for a vacation trip, for around 1200 miles one way. The two complainers were MUCH better, in fact one really had very little to say. The other, still had some loud meows, but much less and not for the entire trip. It worked well to seat buckle them onto the rear seat; easy for them to see/comfort each other and see us.
Great idea that worked well for my cats.
My complaint would be that the material is heavy, making it warm for the cat. It would be nice to have a ventilated panel. I do like the sturdiness of the material, though.",1
so extremely cheap made! put it together and took it right back a part because I couldn't imagine putting any of my animals in this for more then a couple minutes!,0
"I'm now several months into using this light and it has recently started going into thermal shutdown throughout normal operation.  The light is not in a hood, and has good ventilation.  The light flips on and off throughout the day and is very annoying.  For the price I payed for this unit I think the quality control is poor.  The light obviously needs a better heat-sink.

FYI I do not have this light in a hood or air restricted spot.  It is open to ambient room temps of 65*F.

UPDATE (10/30/2015):  I contacted the manufacturer about this product, and after waiting several weeks to process an RMA I received a replacement unit.  The second unit would not program correctly, the overlay/sticker piece on the remote fell off constantly.  I have to use a manual timer to use this light to keep my tank lit till I found a replacement light.  The second light soon after did the same thing as the first one and started turning on and off randomly.

I threw this piece of junk in the trash and will not buy another ecoxotic product.  I wasted a good amount of money and time on a product that has poor quality controls and R&D. I will not even bother with a 2nd RMA on this item, its not worth the time.",0
Good quality filter,1
As advertised,1
"I have had this product for less than a week and the fuzzy outer texture has pilled up and has left my dog without the cozy mat that I expected. I knew it was not a very thick product and I didn't want my dog to have the foam, but I expected the fuzziness to last more than a week.",0
Super absorbent. Gets the job done.,1
So far so good... I really like the fact it's rechargeable. No more pricey hard to find batteries,1
"DANGER WARNING  This toy has 3 small batteries fully exposed in an unprotected, non-wrapped plastic sound box. If batteries are swallowed they could be lethal! DO NOT BUY this toy for your dog.",0
"i already had this carrier in the pink color for my female chihuahua. i like it so much i ordered this one in blue for my male chihuahua. hubby said he needed a manly color, lol. it makes a nice, comfortable, secure ride for them.",1
"Nope, my cats weren't interested in this at all.  But I must say, the stray cats outside loved it.",0
"Good buy! My puppy had leg surgery and we got this to keep him from walking around, but still feel a part of what were doing. He is a 9.5 lb Pomchi and we got a large because the reviews said it runs small. It fit him well but there was definitely a little gapping behind his back. I wish there was a Velcro or elastic band across the belly to help hold him up when he gets sleepy so he doesnt get uncomfortable. He is in it a little wonky in the photo because of the cast and so we had to position his bottom more to one side. Also, because it was a little too deep, the tail hole wasn't in the right place for him comfortably so he just liked it stuck out of his leg hole. I do like that the straps are long enough to be worn straight or cross backed for more support and stability. Overall, nice carrier!",1
Just start using the cage and in one week already falling apart.,0
I purchased this nail trimmer for my cat. Not only did it scare the mess out of my cat it did not work. It's loud and it never trimmed his nails. I would not recommend this product.,0
The fob is too big for cats. It needs to be about 75% smaller.,0
Quality product,1
Amazing for inside ball,1
Very thin material..,0
"We have a Basset Hound, and she had chewed one leg off and its belly out by day two. She is a very aggressive chewer, but we were disappointed it only lasted two days. It is a fairly expensive toy.",0
Two out of three times this product broke when placed inside the toy ball. What a disappointment,0
I was impressed with the quality and reasonable cost.,1
I put this on a twenty year old scuffed up Coach bag and got offers to buy it off my shoulder.,1
My dog can get out of this cage hes just a year,0
Great fit and protection.  No worries about having the dog in my new 2017 Sierra.,1
The small rope that attaches it to tail chaser whip breaks too easily.,0
"I used a brush like this after getting my washing my puppy at a dog wash and noticed how well it worked to take out those loose hairs. The brands they sold were around $20, maybe upwards, so I shopped around and bought this one. Feels and looks like the same quality of the brand they use at the groomers. Definitely happy with this comb.",1
Great travel carrier for our cat.  Thanks for a great product.,1
my cat loves this & it's easy to replace the feather,1
Crudely sewn. Knots protruding. Uncomfortable to hold.,0
Does not stay in place they roll up.  Would not recommend.,0
"I bought this a few weeks ago for my 15yr old Pomeranian. Like a lot of elderly dogs, she's been slowly losing her appetite for certain foods, and it's been tricky to find food/treats that she'll actually eat that are good for her. But so far she really likes the kelp, mixed w/wet food, and I like the kelp because it's healthy and I know that she's getting the extra nutrients that she needs.",1
My dog threw up for 3 days after eating this. I would pass on this one. Not sure what is wrong with this food.,0
"Staywell company changed the size of the door.  We were purchasing this door as a replacement for our existing staywell however, the size was so different (wider and shorter) that we had to scrap the plan.  And because I was irresponsible and did not realize the door shipped from England, it was cost prohibitive to return it.  So, we are stuck with a door we can not use.

We loved the original Staywell and had actually already replaced it once.  This time around, we got burned.  Looking for a new door again but out the original costs.",0
"The ""pair"" was only 2 but a dog has 4 feet! Buying two pair was not cost effective; would have cost like $60.",0
These are the best leashes I've ever had we have 4 of them two to keep at home and two for in my truck. We have a 90 lb German Shepherd and a 100 lb Cane Corso and with the extra handle it much easier to control them when walking best thing is they donate one to shelters when you by one.,1
"Works great. Dog does not yank or pull, even as a hound puppy. Walks are easy, not wrestling matches.",1
"It fuzzed up and the threads making the band of the collar came loose, like it was shredding apart. Then the snap for the quick-release broke. My kitten near immediately needed a new collar.",0
I'm not sure if it's the formula or my dog but this ended up being the cause of my dogs pancreatitis. She had terrible diarrhea until I stopped giving her these. I have two stars because it actually did seem to help her joints it just didn't agree with her pancreas.,0
Quality product,1
Best food you can put your cats in. Their coats are very silky and shinny. They are the healthiest kitty's I've ever had.,1
"Last night, I placed my new heater in my aquarium and verified that the light turned on.  This morning, I placed my hand in the tank to check the temperature, and received a strong electric shock!  AND the water was still cold!  This heater does not work and is dangerous!",0
"It's a pretty cat collar, light weight , very soft and flexable , so comfortable for the cat to wear all the time. It's unique in how it adjusts and I really like it. The cat head bell is super cute too !",1
My 30 lb puggle had the nose and ear torn off this pig within minutes. She doesn't normally destroy her toys like that so it appears this is poorly made. I also purchased the frog toy and that one has held up for 2 days so far. I would not buy this toy again.,0
Barely any water comes out when its filled I have large dogs and they drink it until the dish is dry and the water jug is still totally full,0
"The litter box is awesome - it's a ""must have"" especially if you have multiple cats.. The hood keeps the smell in for the most part, and it gets every last clump out of there with every dump.. Only complaint is that one of the sides isn't a perfect fit (however, with my luck, it's probably just this ONE box that ended up having that ""faulty side"").. When I dump it, it leaks a bit, so I have to clean that up every time - other than that, it's great.. It's a money saver as well, because I have found myself needing new litter less often, so - in the long run, it will be paying for itself!!",1
I really like the color and design.  What i dislike is that i couldn't find a sizing chart.  Every thing marked small has been way too big on her.  So i find an extra small in your product.  It would be too small on a small mouse.,0
"Don't buy this junk it isn't what you want. Very disapointed n I bought two. Doesn't fit the bikes even with retro fitting, it only damaged the breaks.",0
It's made in China ! Will not buy again,0
Very poor quality. The sisal is not glued down. The board used to make the scratcher is a very flimsy and bends easily.  My 15 pound cat flattens the scratcher.,0
I have three cats.  One of them will eat these but only half-heartedly and I find the remains of some left behind so they are not a big hit.,0
Perfect!,1
"I bought this product with high hopes that after trying several products that this would help to ward off barking dogs while on walks.  Dogs frequently come all the way up to the fences separating private homeowners from the sidewalk barking loudly.  I tried using this product and it appears that it has zero effect on the large dogs that aggressively come up to the fence.  It does project a loud hissing sound that I can imagine would help train dogs, however, it did not work for me.",0
The collar seems to be somewhat sporadic. The beep doesn't always go off when she is barking but when it does go out it quiets her right away. The collar is actually really long and it says just to cut it off. But that frayed the collar. So I had to put glue on the end to stop the fraying.,0
"Cat played outside came back with fleas. My cat isn't really an outdoor cat, we let her out for about 15 mins a few times a wk, and let her wonder under supervision. I gave her a bath pit on flea collar and still infested from grass.. Don't buy, a waste of money",0
Not easy to put together & nylon on the base is already 3/4 ripped off of one side after one gentle use by 3 old  5 lb dogs. (Half the maximum recommended weight).  Have to throw it away.  Not worth the hassle to return it.  Don't waste your $.,0
Should have read the reviews. Fail! It gets caught on the C-clamp and there is no fixing that! I will try adding a different toy to the string and see how that works,0
"It's beautiful and well made. There are so many artistic patterns to choose from. I got the one with the modern cat painted design.
Of course my Doberman could care less what it looks like, as long as it is large, which it is. Soft, which it is too. And smells good.
He has been laying on it for a week now, so I'm sure it does.
When you keep it full size, the filling gets a little thin, so I shake it down to fill about 2/3 and then fold the other 1/3 underneath. That way
it is thick enough for my dog not to feel the floor underneath.",1
"The product quality has become terrible lately with the last 2 boxes I received from Amazon. I have even dug through the box towards the middle or bottom, hoping the quality gets better, but with every grab, there are large quantities of FOXTAILS in them. There have been a plethora of FOXTAILS in BOTH boxes that I received. I am starting to question if I should switch to organic hay or a new company entirely. Despite my rabbits being used to this hay, I am debating about switching as the FOXTAILS are embedding themselves into my dogs, my clothes, blankets, towels, etc.. And yes I do wash my rabbit's stuff (as they have blankets/towel in their house) separately from ours. Please discontinue, discount or do something about this problem!!! I cannot keep ordering boxes that I know will do damage to my other animals and goods around us.

Foxtails (Setaria spp.) are invasive weeds in pastures and hayfields. The competitive growth of foxtails with pasture species causes stand thinning and reductions in hay yields. Foxtails may be grazed in spring prior to inflorescence development. However, the production of seedheads is concerning in summer due to the sharp awns that can damage the gums of livestock. Hayfield growers are also concerned about the economic impact of foxtails on yield and hay quality.",0
"This is a poor quality pet bed that won't last you very long.  I purchased it in the 25 inch round, brown and it's a lumpy mess.  I only purchased it to keep underneath a playpen because the foam layer I had is too thin now.  This bed is not much thicker than the two inch foam.  It definitely does not look like the photos.  The inside filling is not only made up of materials that your pet should never sleep on, but it is also sectioned off into 4 rolls.  This makes the bed wavy and lumpy.  I can't even use it under the playpen because of how uneven it is.  The cover did not hold up well after the initial wash.  Purchase a high quality pet bed that will save you money in the long run.",0
"The product itself is OK, my standard size patio door did not allow the setting of this one as it was too tall. I had to return it, but not because the product failed, it was just too tall.",0
"I was looking for a toy to stimulate my normally lazy/bored dog who is primarily just interested in food.  I found this toy which is just what I was looking for - something to keep him entertained and motivated!  I am happy to say that he loves it!  He's had this for a few weeks now and I usually break it out twice a day and he's not bored yet.  It's been fun to watch him play with this because he is so focused on figuring it out.  If it gets too easy, I think putting in larger food will make it more challenging.  I highly recommend this toy!",1
"I was trying to replace a toy my dog chewed apart that belonged to another dog. So much for that. This thing is about a 1/4th of the size of the one my dog chewed! It was advertised as 4x8"" but is actually 2x3"". Not even close!! I want my six dollars back!",0
Very sturdy but clumsy for one person to manage.  The last of the three sections doesn't want to stay extended as it should.,1
My big dogs really love these zuke bones. I like the ingredients and that they are easy to digest. I can also break them in half if I want them to have half a treat.,1
"Very weak light, not good for coral.  Makes corals look red.  I have been trying to return with no luck.  Seller will not respond to my request for return.",0
Great large dog beg for my back yard. Easy to assemble. I have three girls. Two over 100lbs and one who is 13bls. The only one who's used it so far it my little girl.,1
I did not get what was ordered I ordered duck an sweet tatter treat instead go chicken wrapped sweet potato treat. I am sure you don't think this is a big deal but my dog can't eat chicken that is why I order duck.,0
Perfect for adding a little to their dry food to hide medication.  They thought they hit the lottery!,1
The plastic seem broke not long after I got the item and the wooden rail screw came off one side. Like how it keeps the mess in but now using tape to hold it together.  Wish it was made from one piece of plastic not two that was glued together.,0
"Not sure why our dog was not into this toy, as she loves to chew everything, but you win some you loose some",0
I purchased two of these and both have broken where they are not retractable any longer. HUGE waste of money. They are expensive and I wish Amazon would stand behind them. I would love a refund but too late I guess. DON'T Buy it will not last.,0
"At first use, this product overheated and produced toxic fumes which burned the eyes and nose.  I got it to help my cat, who was already sick and distressed.  Thankfully, I removed the plug in before it made my poor cat worse.  I would never recommend this product and hope I can get my money returned!",0
"The product was very disappointing.  The cats showed little or no interest in the catnip tea bags.  I will not be
purchasing this product again!",0
This tree is wider than the last one that I had.  The wider base makes the tree more stable when the cats jump on it.  They really seem to love it.,1
"I absolutely hate this kitty litter. I purchased it because it was on sale, without even considering the fact that it was scented. I don't need my cat's toilet to smell like potpurri. It also creates a ton of dust, so she was sneezing like crazy. And then she smelled like that awful febreeze scent. It'll be a relief when the box is empty.",0
"Didn't work for my cat. I have one that goes up against the side of the box, and urine collected under the lid.",0
IT HAS JUST ONE BLUE LIGHT. DOENST COME WITH ANY ACCESORY IN IT. THE WATER BECOMES CLOUDY INSIDE.,0
"Took a lab and a dane to destroy it, guys were torn out but outside held up for several months.",1
"useless, save your $.",0
"My dogs love them, they don't notice the difference between the regular and weight management greenies, excellent price!",1
Looking for a quality dog bed this is it! Good price to!,1
"I love it because it is easy to put on, I have two small dogs and it works great!!",1
Our Australian Shepherd loved it but it looked like this in 10 minutes. :(,0
"We tried all the ways the product said to transition to feline pine - but no go - don't know why  but we have over a half a 40 lb bag - any ideas on what to do with it?  (gardening,???)",0
Needed something for my xxl dog this works great.,1
"THIS PRODUCT KEEPS THE AQUARIUM AT THE PERFECT PH ALL THE TIME WITH NO CHANCE OF OVERDOSING, I HAVE USED IT WITH EVERY WATER CHANGE ON A WEEKLY BASIS FOR MANY YEARS AND SWEAR BY IT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1
"I have been feeding this product to my cats for several years with good results, but after I received the new bag with new packaging....cat was vomiting over 8 times per day.  (It was so bad, kitty has been on soft food for a week)  Company should have told customers about new formula.  My cat eats this food for his sensitive stomach.  He had been doing so amazing for months since I moved to Amazon shipping vs local pet store to purchase as well.  The only variable, new bag with new look and new size, new formula.  I would generally recommend this product with flying colors, but after this last experience, I can't in good conscience do so.  Even my other cat, who can eat ANYTHING was vomiting.  I have emailed manufacturer to let them know as well.",0
this fits our scottie the best..we have two so far and will get more if we need them..........,1
It's great for my dog. She wouldn't have been able to use steps but the snoozer scalloped sm moths out steps some but yet doesn't make it into a ramp. My disappointment is in the fabric! It started coming apart at one of the side within days of getting it.,0
"It only working after first charge.
Second charge doesn't work at all.
I will rate ZERO STARS!",0
If I could give zero stars I would.  Been using for 2 months now and my dogs still have fleas.  Hasn't helped at all.,0
"Arrived on time, well packaged. We use with the 72 inch led light, easy to set up, instructions say it will retain the setting even if there is a power failure which is a good feature but untested at this time.",1
"Once I found ants all over one on my hummingbird feeders.  I bought one of these for each of my feeders and so far - no more ants.

I think they are only good for a year, but at this price, I'll just buy some more next year.

B. Tefft",1
Love it. Can wear it or hang it.,1
"I purchased two of these items. The large Kurgo to save for further growth. The medium Kurgo fits great. However, the clip broke. The screws came out of the attachment clip to my surprise. I am now using the attachment strap from my large Kurgo harness on the medium harness. I will be sending the broken strap back. Other than that I am pleased. I have a female Pitweiler four months old. She us full of play. I needed a shorter strap to help control her movements. She is very powerful. The other dog, her playmate is a Bernese Mountain Mastiff. During puppy play the screws came out of the metal attachment. I'm happy that I purchased two Kurgo harnesses.",0
"This is an excellent product. My dog has had issues with her immune system, and by the end of the second bottle of it, she has improved notoriously. Her fur had all fallen off. It is growing back. Not sure if it will grow back to where it use to be (she is 9) what a great improvement in her general health! EXCELLENT product.",1
Not good. Slide bar does not hold. Cheap. Would not purchase again.,0
Terrible! It burned my dogs!!,0
"I used this product on my 3cats for years , and it worked well. I wrote the date down as not to miss the 30 day mark . Then last month after never having to worry about fleas all three cats got loaded with fleas, I had no choice but to toss all there toys,scratchers, bedding and brand new 72 inch tree in the trash. I switched to another brand,  a collar but it will take time to get back to normal around here. Its a shame that a product that worked so well for 6 ,8  years or more failed all of us living here. The product is made in France, if others are having a similar problem the owners of the company MERIAL will be taking a heavy hit in there pocket book. I won't take the chance that there problem is resolved and personally I wish someone would bring a civil Class Action law suit against them",0
Best muzzle on the market! Safe and humane. Great great muzzle,1
"Nobody likes to cut the dog's nails, but this is probably the best product out there to do it. Watch some videos first if you've never done it before. No matter what your husband will complain that you are doing it wrong but at least you will know.",1
The dog loves it very good suplier.,1
"It's great. My 2 cats love it because it is super tall. Heed the various warnings on here about weighting down the base, it definitely needs it. I love that there is no carpet and it is SO easy to clean.",1
"The medium should have fit my 15 lb Jack Russell terrier, but it was too big. Unfortunately it costs too much to return, so I'll be donating it to the local humane society.",0
My Discus love this food. So do the Cardinal Tetras and Cori Cats.,1
"I have 2 Persians and they would smell it and walk away????
My Lab enjoyed it, she's my cleanup crew for not liked cat food...",0
I am now a one-litter box home. All the cats use this litter box pine.,1
I have been treating my dog to many different dog treats during the years.  I have to say this is the best one for them.  It has less junk in it and my dog goes crazy for it.  The dogs think it's delicious and you can feel good about yourself for giving them a healthy treat.  I love these so much that I purchased some for my friends that have dogs and they love them to.  I highly recommend this product for anybody that loves their dog and wants to spoil them with quality products!,1
"I'm sure this is a great product, but my cat--who is a surprisingly non-picky eater when it comes to food--wouldn't touch this.  Not even when I mixed just a few kibbles into her regular food.  She actually didn't eat anything for over 24 hours.  She's never rejected any type of dry food before.

She's been on a few other varieties of food (kitten, and then a few types of adult food) before with no issues transitioning.  Her most recent food is the Science Diet Ideal Balance, which seems to have recently disappeared from stores, and I can't even find it on Amazon anymore.  My vet recommended the Wellness brand, so we may try another variety, but this one is being returned.  I've got to find something else before my stash of her old food runs out.",0
"Absolutely love these !!! I have a French bulldog, and sometimes it is hard to get the right size for him. I ordered these for him according to his measurements, and they are a little big, but they still work for him.",1
"Love love love this cat tree. Big enough for both of my cats (almost too big, but no complaints). Sturdy enough for them to play on and leap off without it even moving. It was nice that it came already assembled. Very heavy, so be careful taking it out of the box. Would highly recommend for multiple and larger cats.",1
"Awful. Just awful. The shelves/levels didn't fit correctly. I had to pull out metal wire and do a heavy duty version of twist-tying the levels to the bars on the side to keep them in place. The top slid around on the tank badly and the cat could easily push the top right off. This is not a well-designed product. If you buy it, be sure to have a backup plan in case you want to return it. I had no backup plan so I just had to make it work, but I really feel it was a total waste of money and a couple weeks later, we gave it away to someone else because we were not happy with it.",0
"I travel a lot with my 2 Small Chihuahuas and this is perfect for the food, treats and everything else that I need for 1 month travel, blankets and sweaters are pack separate",1
"For some reason our cats were refusing to drink water unless we replace the bowls daily. *No we don't live in Flint MI.* We talked to the vet and he told us that sometimes cats just get really picky about their drinking water. Well, this has fixed all of that. The cats love the water and we love not having to refill it every day.",1
"Most of the new knock-offs on the market since patent expired don't have the repellent, so they are not as effective.",1
Love it. It helps with the smells. I have a multi cat litter box. Very helpful.,1
Smells great!!!,1
The bottom of this had mold in it when i first opened the package. Would not recommend.,0
"Advertised as 1100 yard. You will be lucky to get 150 yards. I've had it fail to work when the dogs were within 100 yards. Works great if they are close to you. I bought this because it advertised the 1100 yard range. Customer service is also a pain to deal with. I have to send my unit back for them to "" test it"". Meanwhile my window for a refund through Amazon has ""closed"" while I was dealing with them.",0
Arrived on time with no issues,1
We bought this to take our two small Yorkies with us on vacation. We needed something we could use to confine them to one area of the cabin while we was away. This unit was perfect! Simple assembly (less than 1 minute) and light weight. This unit is not very tall but it worked for us. Our yorkies are both under 3lbs so they are very small.,1
My dog really likes this.  Did not take the old dog long to learn how to get the food out.  The puppy is still working on it.,1
"Sherpa Lining is thick and Velcro attached on bottom Support, Sherpa covers entire bottom support of
Carrier. Purchased Large as it gives plenty of room for Cat to hide under towel and move about during transport.
Cat cannot break through the heavy mesh type material for ventilation. Has Top Zipper Opening to place Cat down into Carrier.
Second option is Zipper Opened front which is also for placing Cat inside Carrier.
Must buy another as I've another Cat.
Leaving Zipper doors open with Carrier on floor allows for my Cats at Play box when not being transported.",1
It's a great fence for my guinea pigs. Folds up neatly and flat which is a plus and I can hook it onto another brands fence I currently own as well.,1
"Seems very indestructible so far!! heavy rubber, bounces great and rolls fast when it hits the ground. Dogs like it fine so far.",1
"I thought I already reviewed this product. It took a little while for it to be delivered but only because it is a personalized item. I like it very well. Well etched and very legible, and easy to read.",1
"I have a female painted that is getting bigger by the day..this thing is so perfect for her! Because it rests its weight on the tank..you never have to worry about it falling or the turtle being too heavy. My turtle loves the privacy it provides, and uses the underwater dock every night to sleep on. I can't see how anyone would EVER need to replace this. Thank you for this wonderful platform!!",1
"As soon as I opened the package, I noticed there were already a few rust spots on the cable. I have not used it but we are planning on going camping and I now question the integrity of the cable. I have an excited pit who loves to jumo around, and my worry is that with a few rust spots, the cable won't hold. It is brand new, it should not already have rust. Kinda bummed Im going to have to wait for a new one.",0
"Feb 2014  I adopted a rescue that had no sense of come.....I never had to use the shock.  All it took was the vibrate and then started using the beep to get her to come.  I would recommend this to anyone seeking the help of training.

May 2015  Took this back out of the box after being put away for 1 year as I need it for another dog. Now the screen on the remote doesn't even work anymore!~  Wth? I have brought this down to one star.  No reason it should stop working after sitting in a clean/dry box for a year.  VERY disappointed.",0
"This dog food is not cheap.  It's about $1.50 a pound.  But, that being said I do notice a positive difference in my older dog.  He seems more playful and wants to do things other then just look out the window and be a couch potato",1
I think my cat was laughing at me when I used this stuff.,0
The sizing was not accurate.,0
"Had this for 18 months, flawless operation until recently the water flow slowed and it got noisier.  Was on the ""todo list"" until it stopped working completely.  Due to details on a different website I removed the pump and carefully pulled the flow control arm until that end of the pump came off, then removed the cover from the impellor and thoroughly cleaned everything.  Result - back to day one performance.  The filters protect the pets, but not the motor which has poor filtering and gets well clogged up regardless of whether you have hard or soft water - unless of course your pets never make the water dirty or drool in it!

Clean the pump impellor as well as the casing and this will serve you very well, for a long time.",1
Beware it cute but falls apart and catches on everything. Heard something fall off and my Chihuahua ran trying to eat the rhinestones. Not safe and poor quality.,0
"I liked this idea for a cat food bowl, and, more importantly, my cats do too!  They can't just sit and woof down a ton of food, they have to work a little for it.  I was a little worried before purchasing it that my cat would starve and not figure it out, but in the end, she watched the others stick their paws in and get food, and then did the same.  I would buy this bowl again, and may get a second bowl just like it.",1
"Dog likes them but this bag smells atrocious, smells up the dog and the room she's chewing it in!",0
Fantastic!!!?,1
Need better package. Broke inroute.,0
Very durable collar which I've owned around two months. It shows no sign of wear and my beagle puts it through the test. I have had others that couldn't handle the test my Beagle put it through. Very content with the collar but also the softness it has. Anyone who purchases this collar will be glad they did.,1
"The kitten I picked up from NOAH had chronic diarrhea.  We worked with changing his food and the vet suggested using this product.  The diarrhea has resolved, so it seemed to have worked.",1
My dog isn't picky -- and won't touch these.,0
This product seems to be working.,1
"GREAT PRODUCT - Our CAT Loves it! Lot's of ""ripple"" so he can see the water without pawing it first!",1
Fit perfectly on 8 pound dogs. Look cute and they don't mind wearing them. ,1
"It is soft and like the color. Ordered for two for my 5 pound Persians, but still too small. Ours was not 1714; it was almost 1514.",0
"These are just what I wanted last Christmas, but I could not find them.  So when I saw them on Amazon I bought ahead for next xMas.  They are very pretty, and look to be quite well made.  If I have any problems using them I will update.",1
Snickers loved them!!!!!!!!!,1
i was looking for another bunny but had to settle on the chimp toy ...not her fave but likes it,1
The product was rancid. My birds would not touch it and I don't blame them.,0
"I've previously hesitated in purchasing, contributed to doubts on how effective the product would be.  However, a co-worked shared the same concerns, yet had outstanding success with her dog with the same product.  Unfortunately, the Thundershirt did not affect my dog's anxiety in any way.  While she didn't react negatively, she was also indifferent.  The Thundershirt was utilized through several thunderstorms over the passing weeks (after becoming accustomed to the jacket in normal conditions as directed) and the recent fireworks with zero change in anxiety or fear.  Different fittings were also attempted (loosening and tightening) with no change.",0
Cats didn't figure it out at first. I placed between their two beds and now they go through it in their travels versus going around it!,1
It was okay in the beginning but went whacko and shocked the crap out of my little lap dog. It was promptly shipped to me.,0
"Because you can't leave 0 stars. I'm wondering if this thing is meat flavored because my dog destroyed it less than an hour after I opened it. She's a pittie cross that has a bad nesting habit (read burrowing). She's afraid of high pitched noises so I didn't want to try the sonic deterrent because I don't want to scar her for life. I opened the box, unwrapped the paper thin sheet and put it on the couch. Went to the kitchen, got a drink and heard her on it. Came back and it was shredded. This might work if you dog is afraid of it's own shadow.",0
"Our puppy loves this food.  He eats its up, his coat looks healthy, his weight is good, and he is a growing puppy!",1
"We have used this bird food in the past with no problems.  Shortly after we opened a new bag we noticed it was crawling with many small bugs, later identified as grain weevils.  Although we have previously used two bags of this same product with good results, we are not happy throwing out 50lbs of Bird Seed and will not be buying this product again.",0
"Never got it. If I had, I could tell you how good it may have been. All the fish died in my aquarium while I was expecting this, big loss.",0
fell apart the first time I washed it!,0
I have this hood sitting on top of my 30 gallon dart frog terrarium with 13 watt cfl bulbs. I love having individual switches for each bulb as well as an option for a heat lamp. Very satisfied.,1
"Sweater arrived with a big rip in it, now i have To deal with the return process, huge inconvenience. The sweater, however is adorable and I wish it hadnt come with a tear in it.",0
Unfortunately this didn't work for my Terrier.  He still trembles and pants.,0
My dog doesnt even touch it,0
I use this with my Great Danes (puppies and adults) and LOVE IT! Price and shipping were great too. Thanks very much.,1
"My cat loves them.  She tosses them in the air, she brings to my feet like she had caught something and wanted to,show me what she caught.  She plays for hours with them.  They are on the small side but cute and easy for,the cat to play with.  For,the price it is a great product in my eyes.

Update:

They only lasted for about one week.  Now all they do is lie on the floor.  I tossed them.  Ffor the money it was worth the short time of fun she had with them.  Would have hoped they would have lasted at least one month.",1
We have two kittens and one 7 year old cat.  All the commotion from the ball rolling around gets the old guy to chase them off and play himself. He usually won't play with string or laser pointers but this product he comes back to over and over!,1
"I was very excited to get this. First off, the thing was scratched, dented, and one of the lock latches was broken. Too top it off the box didn't fit together correctly and it looks like the part where the scooper goes was just cut out bc it doesn't fit correctly and has no seal so i doubt the waste is going to even stay in there with all of these issues. Amazon, was of course, amazing about ordering me a replacement at no cost. I'm just dissatisfied with the way this item came to me. I hope the new one is a different story.",0
a real money saver,1
Does not work for my very small dogs. I purchased 2 based on review of people who had small dogs.  It's too big for my very small dogs and a big waste of my money.,0
This is an outstanding product,1
"Not only does this ""new and improved odour control"" product NOT work as well as the original Nature's Miracle, the scent is literally sickening. The old product smelled briefly like alcohol, then dissipated quickly. This stuff STINKS, makes me and my family extremely nauseous, gives us headaches, and persists overnight. This is unacceptable in a bedroom. It also eems to serve as a kitten attractant, rather than discouraging them from peeing on the bed. How do I get my money back?",0
this is the worst filter made save your money. buy a aquatop cf-5oouv you will love it,0
My Golden Retriever was able to rip this off and destroy it within minutes. It's now a $50 chew toy.,0
"I just gave my German Shepherd Lion (no, I don't have a German Shepherd breed of lion, but a German Shepherd named Lion) a bath with this shampoo and I give this my unqualified recommendation. Have you ever used a shampoo on your dog and afterwards they just smelled like wet dog? These are probably the most irritating dog products that there are. I just ask two things of a dog shampoo for Lion: fo tirst, that the shampoo does not dry out his skin and second, that he not smell like wet dog. This managed to succeed on both counts. Plus it was really easy to apply and to rinse off. I had good success using the fine density on one of my two cats (the other one will probably kill anyone who ever tries to give him a bath). So this line of products is riding pretty high in my books. I need to add that I got both of the shampoos as products to review, but if anyone thinks that that would influence my review should check my reviews. If a product deserves a poor review I don't hesitate to give it a two or one star review. But the other side of getting items to review is that you get to know products that you might otherwise not get exposed to. I often get to know products that then become things I use on an ongoing basis. I think this will very probably be one of them.",1
great toys...,1
"Flimsy.  I have an old one that I found at a yard sale compared to it this new one is junk.  The idea is ok and I like the extra insert but really, put a few extra pennies into it and make it more sturdy.  I have a 15 lb cat that won't get on this one.  I have two toilets and placed one trainer on each of them.  I'm glad to have the old one so that the heavy cat has a trainer that she will use.",0
Everything I hoped for,1
Does the job it is intended for,1
"It's a good product, but It's pretty rough knowing the price just jumped 35% out of no where. They got a few good reviews and now they're price gouging? The packets are only three ounces.",0
Works amazing!,1
"Worked very well. Had no problems. I used a 3 for my dogs under belly and a 5 on top. I had to stop to trim out the knots but this was his first groom so he was pretty bad! The noise was pretty low, took him only just a few minutes to get use to it.",1
We  have not used it yet but we did try it out on  two of our four schnauzers. It  does appear that when we get down to using it before grooming day that it will help.  In the  test it  appeared that it did not pull their hair as we  combed thru it.,1
"I purchased this fish food because I thought that it would be nutritionally superior to other foods; however, if any speck of this stuff makes it past your fish, it will turn into a jungle of fungi within about 4-6 hours leading me to think that it may have had fungal spores on it already. The cheap stuff I bought will not grow mold within 2 days (usually the fish get to it by then). Would not recommend this product.",0
Loooover it! My dog has stopped itching she is healing quickly. will reorder in the future!,1
I bought my second Four Paws harness for my dog. The first one I bought X-Large about 1 year ago. Decided to get a new one same size and same brand. The only problem was I don't believe it's X-large as it nowhere fits my dog.,0
"My little Rudy says ""yum yum""! These have been a staple for our pets for a long time. Most importantly..they are MADE IN THE USA!!!
We NEVER! NEVER buy pet food, snacks or products from outside the US. Too risky as a few countries have been busted for the 'crap' used in their products, particularly food.",1
"Not only is this ridiculous and cheaply made piece of junk a choking hazard due substandard quality, but it stinks! Real fur carries a decomposing scent even with sanitizing, and it reeks of decomp and vomit. Ew. ZERO stars if I could.",0
"This bowl arrived dusty, dirty & dented, lik it had been sitting neglected on a shelf for ages. I sent it back for replacement (with a message about the dent). They sent the exact same bowl back to me. I sent it back with a message saying not to send it again. We'll see.",0
Good Cat tree!  I have one cat.  She loves it! She sleeps on it all day.  Uses the scratching posts.  It was easy to put together.  Happy with this product!,1
"WARNING, DO NOT BUY!!!! After seeing this on shark tank I thought finally something I can use to get rid of fleas in our house. We have three (indoor) cats and this year the fleas are real bad. We bought $120.00 of this stuff directly from the site, waited 7 days for it to arrive and were so excited to use and solve our flea problem. The product is a STINKY, STICKY, SLOPPY MESS that made all of our cats sick, gave my wife and daughter a massive headache. Our cats got sick and would not eat their food for three days. The WHOLE HOUSE STINKS, the cats are STICKY AND SMELLY.
The sharks should be ashamed for investing and indorsing this product. The hype generates the sell which translates to money and thats all they care about. This product SUCKS.
I followed all the direction by doing the test first then the following day the full treatment. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!
DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, AND DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!
BTW  the fleas that jumped in our white sink while  treating got a direct spray and all they did was start hopping, it did no kill them in 3 seconds like advertised, the fleas laughed and kept hopping.
WHAT A JOKE!
THIS PRODUCT SUCKS, STINKS AND IS SUPER STICKY, THE SMELL DOES NOT GO AWAY AND OUR CATS ARE SUFFERING 10 TIME WORSE THAN BEFORE WE USED IT.
DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, AND DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!
COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I bought this because I bought a new Charger and my German Shepherd and my Chihuahua like to go driving with me. It works great to protect my back seat. I also have a cheap pair of seat covers on my seats and then I use these for extra coverage, especially because of the Shepherd. Between the two I believe my car is well protected!!",1
"It arrived with a good 3"" gash in the bag, so was obviously done prior to packing so not sure how much food was lost. But estimated a couple pounds.  Great food just beware.",1
"Pretty cheap, did a good job keeping our mastiff from inhaling his food in 30 seconds but broke on day 4 when he dislodged one of the pillars. Going to try gorilla glue and see if that works",0
"The puppy will never love bath time, but we sure love how good she smells and how soft she feels after using this shampoo and conditioner.  Love it!",1
"Wanted to love this collar, but, after 4 months the rope snapped...wasn't even under any tension when it happened.  Also, cool metal piece makes a lot of noise with a metal pet tag attached.  Love the idea...wish it lasted longer.",0
All five of my cats consistently turn up their noses at this flavor.  They enjoy all the other fish flavored choices from Friskies but this one just doesn't please them.  With five cats there is often one of them who doesn't like any particular flavor but since all five don't like this one I have to give it two stars.,0
Kitties love it!,1
its a very nice light. my plants are growing rapidly with it algae too. its works well as other popular more expensive  brands.,1
great dish. easy to care for and just right for a small dog.,1
"It didn't work when I used it. When I put the batteries in, it made a sound like it was working but when I put it in the water nothing happened. I had a feeling it would happen based on other reviews but I thought Id try it out and keep my expectations low. Im going to try and find another vacuum that works.",0
"Good ramp - works for me, if it folded up to be a bit narrower, it would be perfect so I can easily fit it in the back of my car along with 2 large dogs.",1
Keeps away fleas for the 8months,1
"The bottle I received had the safety seal broken, I hesitated to give it to my dog because of that. But it looked ok and didn't smell funny. The second day shortly after taking it my dog vomited. That was enough for me. Product went straight in the garbage.",0
"My finicky cats who usually hold out for treats and wet food, really love this.",1
Two of the 3 I ordered were broken upon receipt.,0
"If you have a pond of gold fish, you will definitely want to purchase this quantity of food to prevent from going broke.  This is quality food which inspires your fish to go nuts at every feeding.",1
"Save your money DONT buy this! I have a standard poodle & thought this product would be great until I tried to use it (UGH) no way is this big. Might work if you have a tiny dog but not big enough or even lengthened even enough for me to use. Too late for me to send it back so I'm stuck with this junk!
TERRIBLE/USELESS what more can I say...",0
"The toothbrush is stiff (does not move) and relatively small. While it works great to clean my dog's teeth, I cannot get the toothpaste out of it. Our other toothbrush is more flexible and you can clean it. It gets gross really fast. I ended up returning it.",0
Awesome  Perfect,1
My cat did not like these at all.,0
"This mat is great.  Keeps mess off of floor and much easier to clean up, it doesn't move around and the kitties don't mind the rim.  It was a good purchase.",1
"I really like the LED temperature display and control.
It was able to hold the temperature steady once I set the desired temperature. Easy!
And, completely submersible.

I'm disappointed that it stopped working after less than 2 years.
When I plug it in, the display LEDs flash briefly then they turn off. No heat.
There is no sign of damage, so I assume this is some sort of electronic part failure.
Others have reported similar problems.

The manufacturer's warranty is only 6 months.

Had to quickly buy a replacement heater to keep our turtle warm.
-----
Feb 21, 2013 update: response from Finnex:
  Hello Wayne,
  We are sorry to hear about the problem with our heater. It sounds like you got a bad sensor, which is
  unrepairable. Our heaters carry a 6 months limited warranty against manufacture defects.
  We are sorry to advise you the heater is no longer under warranty.",0
"I have 3 dogs. 2 boxers and one terrier. One of my boxers was having stool issues and vomiting often (sensitive stomach). We could not keep weight on her AT ALL! We fed her a large amount of different brand dog food and she still looked starved. We went to a pet store one day and asked for recommendations. They recommended this product (we get the salmon flavor to help her skin as well). We couldn't be happier! No more throwing up. No more bad poo's, and now it looks like we feed her! She (like many boxers) is still on the skinny side but not just ribs and hip bones sticking out. Since this product is expensive we feed our other 2 dogs purina pro plan (which works for them). Some reviews mention the dogs having stinky gas... BOTH my boxers stink us out of the house and the terrier doesn't fart at all (maybe a breed thing?). But, they are on 2 different dog foods (so not necessarily just the dog food causing the stink). Worth the money!!",1
Exactly what our 7 year old lab needed.  No more creaking and no more dragging of her back leg!,1
No instructions. Not enough hardware.,0
"Very disappointed in this one.  I've bought dozens of nylabone products for my dogs and haven't really been disappointed until now.  Less than 24 hours after putting this down for the dogs, I noticed a collection of blood on the toy and bleeding gums on my dog (not horrible, just a couple small scratches).  What bothers me the most is the fact that the toy is this sharp and cut up my dog's gums after they had it less than 24 hours.  I have 2 dobermans and 2 old English Bulldogges.  One of my dobermans is the one with the cut gums. Definitely not a good one for power chewers.",0
"Terrible product, I had to return two of them due to a hole in the middle of raft. Such a shame cause its so cute.",0
They can't get enough of this toy and it still looks almost new.,1
Min pin size. Works great!,1
"I did lots of research and Orijen had the best product for my requirements.  As I said, my kitty Kiri loves the food and we have no digestion problems.

I just wish it could be less expensive.",1
I love this litterbox. It cuts down on smell and is easy to clean. I have dogs living with me and they can't see inside to try and eat the poop which is great. The stairs catch a lot of the litter so litter isn't everywhere around the house. My cats love it.,1
I have diabetic dog that had lost a lot of weight accompanied by a very poor coat. Diabetic food prescribed by Vet did not work; I scrambled to find something that did - this did (to my surprise). He is back to his normal weight (85 lbs vs. 64 lbs) and has a very good coat now. He remains on insulin along with this food and continues to do great. This seems to be a solid food - if it works for him i suspect it will work just as well for non-diabetic dogs.,1
"Fish love it but they eat almost anything.  I used to use this for my large Jack Dempsey which I did notice a color change with, still waiting for my Pacus to get more color.  Reason I bought it from Amazon instead of the fish store is they were closed over the weekend and Prime would allow me to get it faster.  It was not cheaper, as it should be, it was one dollar more and I was charged tax.  I try to support local business especially when you lose out buying from Amazon but the fish needed food.",1
Eh.. these collars are ok. They serve the purpose but are pretty cheaply made. Ive had mine about 2 weeks and already the glow stick has fallen out. I suppose Ill be taping it back in as I do like them. I have 2 black GS and at night I cant see them so these are (were) helpful. Its actually kinda funny watching them run around and only seeing the collars. I may shop around for better constructed ones.,0
"The large fit my 15 lb terrier and won't even fit over my big toe. Not sure what the sizing problem is, but I wish I knew before I wasted my money.",0
Brightened the tank,1
"I did lots of research before purchasing this container, and I'm glad I did.  The lid seals tightly and has sturdy hinges, unlike some of the other ""airtight"" containers.  This one easily holds 35lb of dog food, and looks great in the kitchen.  I can't smell the dog food, and the food stays fresh.  I love it.  Some people say the wheels are fragile, but mine have held up thus far.",1
good price,1
The product did calm my cat down but it took about 2.5 weeks to get this product after I ordered it. I though it wouldn't take that long since I have prime but I think due to the holidays the seller must have not shipped it very close to my order date.,0
Great light very bright cool setings.,1
Great product.  Dog loves the taste and licks his chops after having his teeth brushed.  Best I've ever bought.,1
I have a 10 yr old Siberian Husky and she LOVES the taste of these! She thinks they are treats and we have noticed a difference in her walking since giving her these,1
"We loved our cat napper, well, our cats loved it!  They sat in it every day for about 8 months.  Sometimes they'd sit together, but mostly apart (one is 8 pounds, one 10).

Unfortunately the frame broke.  Both plastic sides snapped and broke, rendering it useless and dangerous since it broke when one got on it.  I do NOT recommend something that will break in 8 months!!

***UPDATE- I did email Fleximat directly and they are sending me a new frame free of charge.  I just hope these last longer, but was very pleased at their willingness to rectify the situation!***",0
"This food gave my dog diarrhea and she had a lot of trouble people- where she looked in pain.  She has never had a reaction to any food Ive given her - ever.  The day I switched her food she was almost normal again, and within two days she her poop was completely normal.  I took her to the vet and everything I thought was wrong with her was fine.  They suggested trying another food.  Within a few days on different food her poop was completely normal.  I try to feed her the best quality food- and this is definitely not it.  I feel awful that I even put her health in jeopardy to begin with from a well known, trusted company.  Its so awful that you cant trust any company or brand these days.  I read somewhere that they put lead in their food and its made in China, which has different regulations. I have never left a bad review on Amazon- so the fact that I am making sure to notify others should say how important it is NOT TO BUY THIS!",0
"We shaved our rough collie too early this year ( crazy weather ) then had a terrible cold rainy spring with a bit of snow--wasn't expecting that. Our poor dog was clearly cold. This jacket fit her perfectly, and she wore it without any fuss! Being a rough collie, she's not a ""clothes dog""  , and I'm not a dress up your dog person either. This was a necessity for her, and it fit great and kept her comfy. Lesson learned: flowers don't get planted til after mother's day--and the dog doesn't get shaved for the summer til then as well!",1
"These are great! I have two cats and was trying to use nail clippers before, without much luck. These cut clean, are easy to use, and the guard is a plus. I hope they last forever!",1
"Unfortunately, my dog (6 yr old cocker spaniel) showed little interest (she normally does not play with toys much). She always chase squirrels when she finds them on a walk, but it seems she likes only live squirrels...",0
"Well made , durable and works well.",1
"My cats are very finicky and do not eat even the most expensive cat food. Finally,I tried Purina and they love it. If they are happy and healthy (they are both 15years old)then I am happy.",1
"size is more of an extra small, I ordered a medium, wayyy to small, recommend for xs small dogs such as toy breeds. Adorable outfit and texture.",0
Work for two days. Then the battery died. Tec support tried but couldn't get it to work. So I canceled. A waste of money.,0
My cat wouldn't eat any. I returned itm,0
My cat will not eat any treats but these.  He loves them.,1
"It sounds like this collar might work for some dogs - I'd guess larger breeds - but with my daschund/mini-pincher mix, it was an utter disaster. I set it to the first setting, which adjusts the level of electricity based on whether the dog continues to bark. For the first hour it was on, his reaction after barking was an immediate yelp followed by quiet. Yeah! Wonderful! Than some friends came over. As soon as they knocked on the door, he let out two barks before suddenly switching to screams of pain and panic. With each scream he was zapped again, sending him into an absolute panic. We finally caught him after he ran all over the house petrified and peeing from fear and pain. After removing the collar, he hid in the far back of his kennel for about an hour trembling, and would NOT come out.",0
"I have a min-pin an those dogs too have a large rib cage.  The large fits great an these are the best vests by far!!!!
They are great as well with my lookout car seat...
I have 4 of them!",1
We set this up pretty easily after receiving it.  The biggest issue is that the corner tabs that insert into the other corner are pretty flimsy and no longer keep together.  We will need to reinforce those with some tape.,0
My cats will eat this and even enjoy it but what about a tablespoon of (mostly) broth justifies the outrageous price?  This is not a comment about the Amazon price but a reflection on the price of a single unit at ANY retailer.,0
Renee likes this.,1
This product made my miniature poodles skin much worse.  Don't buy anything from EQyss as they won't honor their written guarantees!  Buy from a reputable company instead.,0
Pretty good food. My complaint is that it crumbles into a dust that makes their cage dirty a lot faster than other brands of food. Most likely won't buy again but that's a minor complaint I feel so I still have it 4 stars because it's a quality rat food with no junk.,1
"I've always found human reviews of cat food to be odd. After all, cats are known to be persnickety, and what one cat likes, another is bound to not like, just because they are cats and that is how they roll. My cats, fortunately, all happen to like this collection of cat food, I suspect primarily because of the texture. They don't like loaf style food, only chunky bits.  The flavor doesn't even seem to matter as long as the texture is there. So for what it is worth, my kitties enjoy this, and the Amazon price is reasonable, particularly with the subscription service. Amazon service is always first rate, and I've never received a dented can. The boxes are packaged with an extra layer of cardboard to ensure their safe arrival. This product gets four paws up from my crew.",1
This did not come with the glasses or batteries which I why I bought this model.,0
I love it !,1
"It is a good idea. Space to insert pill is very small. Both my cats will not touch the treats at all, no matter if pill is inserted or not.",0
Wish I knew about this when I bought my RO unit. I learned the hard way. A must have if your water has chloramines in it!  It has increased my water production and decreased the amount of waste water.,1
We will see Friday when the cat comes,1
As described. Best value.,1
The dogs love them.,1
"Came with broken zipper. Clasps are plastic. Really a one time use thing and even then I barley got my 2.5 pound puppy through the airports and home without issues due to weak zippers, platic clasps etc. Don't bother with this!",0
does not work. complete rip off!,0
"I got this for my 20 pound cat. He LOVES it. Since he's getting a bit old he really enjoys wearing a sweater. This one is made very well, roomy armholes and the neck is perfect.",1
Didn't fit my small 5lb chihuahua at all! Disappointed!,0
"Does not work for ticks. Bought this for my indoor / outdoor cat. Our yard is treated for ticks, but we live in a heavily wooded and rural area and sometimes out cat ventures into the woods. My dogs stay in the yard and never get fleas or ticks, but since we've had the cat I've noticed her bringing back the little buggers. Since application I have pulled one or more embedded ticks off of my cat daily for the last 10 days.  I called my vet and was told that the ticks in our area (northwest PA) are immune to the Frontline products.  However, I did give it 2 stars as it thus far seems effective at controlling fleas.",0
"It stopped working the other week. Not even a month of use. Very disappointing, as the last one I bought worked for about 6 months.",0
I can honestly say that this product has not changed the amount or frequency of my rat terrier's excessive shedding. The peppermint oil in them hasn't even helped with her bad breath or other odors. Rather expensive for what it is and doesn't do.,0
"Excellent size gives Emma room to move. she loves it, and she even lays in the carrier during the day-what more can you ask for!  Also love that it has two openings.",1
"I use this Kurgo harness model on both my 7 year old and 5 month old Shelties. The puppy recently outgrew his extra small Kurgo harness so I got him a medium like his big brother wears. I adjusted it to the smallest size and it fits him well. It will adjust to accommodate his size all the way through adulthood. They both wear their harnesses 24 hours a day with no problems. The harness makes it very easy to control the dogs while walking, getting in and out of the car and it keeps them safe and secure while riding in the car.

***UPDATE 5/14/17  I found a big sore on the top of my Sheltie's neck directly under the metal fitting that connects 1) the top of the two straps that connect to the top of the chest pad and 2) the forward end of the strap that goes along the top of his back. I am going to cover the fitting with black velvet and after the sore has healed, start using the harness again.",1
Sturdy and float well. This is my golden retrievers favorite toy. The last one lasted 3 years with almost daily use!,1
It says you get a package of 8. I only received 1 package. And the package was ripped by the post office.,0
My puppy is clean and smells fresh,1
my cat loves these,1
"We will be fostering a puppy in the near future...we haven't actually used these yet, but they seem well made and are very portable.",1
"The product works as it should, we have no complaints and neither do the dogs. We used the product on our 47lb blue heeler and 86lb aussie shepherd cross. I only give 5 stars for stuff I really am impressed by, hence 4.",1
"These get five star because they exist. I never thought a tennis ball could be destroyed so quickly...then I got a pit bull. My gal can still tear into these if we forget she has one long enough, but they sure do last a lot longer than a regular tennis ball!

This is the second time I have purchased a set of 12 in a year...ish. As long as she keeps loving them, and they stay reasonably affordable I'll keep buying them",1
"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! This dust is HORRIBLE!!!! After my chins used this product, they had a gritty feel to their coats. I trusted the Oxbow brand but my trust was obviously misplaced as this is horrible chinchilla dust.",0
I bought these as a give away for a dog tournament. They are similar to bully sticks but a lot less expensive. Dogs were happy as were their owners.,1
My Golden chewed this up within 20 minutes. Don't waste your money.,0
"I would not order this again. First, my dog chewed through it pretty quickly. Second, it is dangerous.

Dog's are just like big babies.. They don't know whats good for them. They will keep chewing until they're teeth break and fall out.

A $5 toy might just turn into a $1000 vet bill.

Beware.",0
Does not seem to be standard size.,0
Excellent product.  Will purchase again.,1
This was just what we were looking for.  We wanted something with a door on it.  It is perfect for us.,1
"The dogs really like the taste of these.  However, one of them started to choke on it, managed to cough it up but I had to throw away after that incident.  Maybe a ball shape is not a good idea for a treat?  If you have a dog who likes to swallow quickly, I think you should NOT give them this treat.",0
thank you,1
My dogs love it!,1
I bought this for my bengal cat and he didn't even notice the smell of the catnip.,0
It works great!!!!,1
seems to be helping 20 year old cat,1
Nice sturdy rope toys.  They feel like they should last awhile.  The ball at the end of the rope could be used as a weapon if needed.  Lots of tug-o-war fun.,1
Warning!-CONTAIN PROPLENEBGLYCOL (ANTIFREEZE) OUTLAWED BY FDA FOR CAT FOOD.,0
Only lasted about six months and then started to fall over. Will not buy again,0
Pretty much what you expect... haven't used long term but seems well enough made.  Fits the door on a 2017 Santa Fe just fine.  No complaints!,1
"I don't write reviews for every product on Amazon, but I felt that people needed to be warned.

My husband and I purchased two of these (very expensive) units, with hoods, and the reusable tray, and the crystal litter. At first, everything seemed fine. The cats were using it with no problems, there wasn't much of a smell, and the machine did scrape the tray after the box was used. We have two cats, but they are separate. So each cat has their own litter box.

To save money, we chose the reusable trays. After about a week, the smell was noticeable. By the end of the month, the smell had already been awful for several days. But we tried to stick it out since the litter is supposed to last 30 days and is expensive. What we didn't realize is that cleaning the reusable tray would be an experience to make even the strongest stomachs turn. When you open the unit and remove the tray, immediately you are gagging. Cleaning it is unbearable. The urine and feces caked on to the tray. It took almost 3 hours to clean both litter trays and sanitize them and refill with litter. My husband scooped out the litter box twice a week (which defeats the purpose of scoop free...) My husband literally had to wash his clothes immediately after cleaning the litter boxes, he reeked like cat urine and the whole house smelled (litter boxes are in the basement).

After the first month, we decided to use 1.5 bags in each box, to help absorb more urine and the smell. Same problem. The third month, we tried using 1 bag on Day 1, and adding a bag on Day 15. Same problem. The fourth month, we gave in and switched to disposable trays, and we began scooping the box out daily. We also added additional litter on Day 15. Same problem, minus the caked on urine. It did save time to use the disposable trays. The fifth month, we started switching the trays out every 20 days. Same problem. The sixth month we didn't change anything. The seventh month we started changing the disposable trays every 15 days with daily scooping and adding additional litter. You get the idea...

Also, we have hardwood floors and stepping on those crystals is literally like stepping on a Lego, only disgusting because you don't know if the crystal has urine inside of it. I've actually had the crystals cut my feet open and cause me to bleed. And we have a litter tracking mat, too.

We have routinely been spending $60-80 per month on JUST cat litter, which is insane. We've had the boxes for about 10 months now, and we literally can't stand it anymore. We are switching back to regular litter boxes with regular clay. We used to scoop it daily and change the litter every month. We thought this would make our lives easier. It's only made things worse.",0
"Our sweet Kyra was having a very hard time getting traction on our hardwood flooring. She had been diagnosed with Cushing's disease and her health began to decline in old age.

She was no longer able to go up stairs due to hip and back problems, but then her back legs began to splay because her paws no longer stood up straight on the floor.

We tried the rubber glove style slip-on booties, but they didn't help at all. I found these at a local dog boutique shop and paid over $60 for the set.

They have a substantial sole design and good structure. Upon putting them on the very first time, she could stand up on her own four feet without assistance. She regained her quality of life for her last two years thanks to these shoes.

It's been three years since she passed away, but now it's time for our new Standard Poodle Puppy to go out in public. We are buying another pair for him because we had such a great experience with these shoes before.

They are expensive, but no price can be placed on protecting our baby's paws from hot Atlanta pavement. While his needs are different from Kyra's, there is no better shoe available for any need.

They are well-constructed, with a quality Vibram sole. They are comfortable, with no rough edges to cause blisters, and a thick enough sole to go from hiking, to snow, to simply walking in the yard, without any concern for him stepping on our massive Fire Ant mounds, or getting burned by crossing the driveway.",1
"This product did not work out well for my dogs.  Although they enjoyed the taste, they both ended up with bloody stools and vomiting for several days. I would not recommend this product to other dog owners.",0
Not to sure it really works.,0
"My finicky Persian loves these treats.  I've bought other flavors of Temptations cat treats and she's very fond of them as well.  My other cat is also very fond of these treats but he loves anything related to food so you can go by his tastes.  The Persian is very sensitive to cat nip so I wondered if she would react to the treats.  She didn't.  Regardless, I shake the box and she comes running no matter what she was doing at the time.",1
Bought this for my 3 month old kitten and it worked just fine.  Fit him nicely and didn't seem to bother him.,1
"I foster dogs and have two of my own, typically have 5-6 smalls dogs in my home and using the disposable pads was very expensive.  I bought two packs so i can have two out while two are being washed.  They are holding up nicely in the couple weeks they have been in use.  The dogs adjusted to these easily.  No complaints so far.  I bought the large size, good size for my pack.",1
When my dad opened his present he flipped! He loves hitting golf balls for the dogs but hates when they chew them up so this was the perfect gift. Works great AND looks good =],1
This brush is great! I first bought the Furminator and my cat hated it it ripped out tons of hair! This brush gets loose hair without ripping all the hair out. My long haired cats loves being brushed now! It is also a great price.,1
"Do not buy this. I ordered 2 medium (for 70 lb dogs) and got terrier size or smaller. Not even close to fitting on my 60 lb dogs head. They are not manes either, they are more or less cheap caps with velcro at the bottom, no elastic (as advertized), no ears (as advertised). Half of the hair fell out when taking out of the package. CHEAP CHEAP AND S***TY S***TY! Not to mention it took over 2 months to arrive. Pay more for better!",0
Perfect...Very sharp and easy to handle!,1
The toy doesn't hold biscuits. It isn't well designed. I was very disappointed with this item. Unlike a Kong which works the way it's suppose to. They were also very expensive for being pretty worthless.,0
It spilled out and when delivered the box was soaking!,0
still had worms I guess,0
"If you have a big dog and know how expensive a nice snow suit can be, consider this one.  I have a standard poodle who is very ""busy"".  I knew that the legs might be a little short, but I could always add a little to them, if necessary.  The XL was a little big on my guy, but fit well enough that he had extra room and could run, jump and play fine with the snowsuit staying in place perfectly.  The front legs are a tiny bit short, and the rear legs are fine for him.  I will probably add a little banding to the legs, and will have a great snow suit for a price that doesn't break the bank.

I could not be more happy with this product and will probably order some smaller ones for my smaller dogs.",1
"My dogs love this!!  It has really made a difference in their coat - so sleek and shiny!  I stir two pumps in my larger dogs morning food, and one pump on her evening meal.  My smaller Beagle gets one pump on her food for each meal.  I plan to continue using this product!",1
"I have a toy Teddy Bear that had recurring yeast infections in his ears. After many trips to the Vet she finally gave me the name of this ear cleaner, I WORKS WONDERFUL!! No since flare ups I use it daily! It helps dry out the ear canal to keep moisture at bay.",1
Would have given 5 stars if the front door was made with a tighter knit.  those holes are just the right size for my poodle to start bigger holes.  I think it should have a screen like mesh.  Other than that it's a great buy.,1
"I own another product from the same company which works very well so I assumed this would also.  The problem with this product is not the light or the balls construction.  As I found out the flaw is in the plug that houses the light and  battery.  After only a few gentle throws on a grass covered golf course to a dog with a very soft mouth the plug was lost. The ball itself was not damaged and the light and battery remained intact, just outside of the ball.  Very disappointed both myself and the dog.",0
Great for the dogs!!,1
"I received this item very quickly with the gravel siphon that I ordered,
It arrived packaged and there seems to be no damages.
My 55 gallon tank is new so I have not yet used this tubing for my air stones that I also ordered.",1
"This little cat tree is awesome. The product comes with very simplified instructions, but it was super easy to put together. It took me about 10 mins total, from unpacking to putting my kitten on top of it. I got the tree for a 10week old kitten so she could get away from my 2 dogs when she needed to. Since the top is a platform, I put her food at the top as well. So far she just loves it! It is perfect if you don't have a lot of space, and would fit perfectly in a corner.",1
My 12 lb. Yorkie had a bad reaction after one use.  Threw the rest away.  Grrrrrrr,0
I am very environmentally minded. I live at the beach and absolutely HATE when so many lazy folks do not clean up after their dogs-obviously they bring their dogs here just for that reason and then promptly get in their cars and drive away-this is so wrong! I have always picked up after all my dogs and I always used these bags because they are biodegradeable-not plastic. I have not had any problem with the bags splitting or losing its contents like others have said-but then again now I have a small 25lb dog so hasn't been a problem so far. In the past I have had large dogs but no problem then either. I hope the quality doesn't get real bad-I would hate to switch to something else. The shipping from Amazon was astounding-ordered and arrived in 2 days on Sunday!,1
"I love this, it is the only thing my dog cannot chew through... well except for the plastic pan that sits under the dog.  He pulled the bedding back and broke the plastic pan and chew that, but he hasn't been able to chew the cage itself.  I would recommend this product.  Our cat loves to sleep in it too.",1
"My rescue dog loved them,",1
Love this product. Only a few sprits and my puppy was smelling good for days!,1
"My cat seems to like these and I like that they don't have a lot of extra additives. What more can I say, they are cat treats. The price is pretty good here on Amazon.",1
My dog LOVES these !!,1
It doesn't work. I couldn't feel anything when I tried to test it. My two dogs didn't respond to this collar at all.,0
"These aren't sharp at all and are difficult to get through larger claws. :(.  I do like the little nail file that fits into the bottom, but it would be nicer if it was longer",0
Dog loves this product.,1
The fountain's sensor for how full the water is does not seem to work. We have come home several times to water all over the floor because it just kept filling.,0
Kills some but not all.,0
"Great dog food, price it a little steep.",1
"Great product. The inner tube holds the air very well. It stays on without twisting. My puppy tried everything to chew it and get it off and it didn't Happen. We use it to keep him from
Going through or under the wrought iron fence. Easy to put on and take off",1
Didn't hold up outdoors well.,0
It lasted for about 2 minutes before the thing fell apart.  The dog isn't an aggressive chewer either.,0
"The product is very cheaply made. The steps do not raise up, they lift off. It was almost impossible for my dog to use because it was very slippery. I have thrown mine away and ordered a different product.",0
The pads seemed dry when I opened the container.  I will not purchase this item again - perhaps the spray next time.,0
"this thing is really cute and well-made, but for some reason it makes my french bulldog puppy lose her MIND. barking, scratching, fighting it...it's like there's something in the material that makes her freak out. she goes insane. but...i think she likes it? hard to tell.",1
Remote didn't work. I held on the phone for 20 min and they were no help. Batteries were good as the collar worked with both batteries. I would give this zero stars if possible since I can't return it.,0
Came broken.  Completely stopped talking after a month.  Save your $ and buy it at pet store.  Lasted for 3 years from there.,0
"This is wonderfully made and seems sturdy.  The Seller is very good and responsive.  I highly recommend them.
I am unfortunately sending the steps back because my little dog will not go near them.  Resistant to change.  The angle of the steps to the lever(?) that holds it steady is a bit less than I thought it would be.  Does not match up to my mattress.  The Seller sent a free return label with the steps and I am very impressed with them.  You can trust this Seller.",1
Kitty enjoyed it,1
My chocolate lab with hip dysplasia loves his new bed.  He can sleep then get up without limping.  Wonderful product.  The transaction went very smoothly and the bed arrived in good condition.,1
Highly recommended by our cats!,1
"These are clearly my cats favorite toys.  Once they've all disappeared under a low cabinet or furniture he'll play with something else.  When I retrieve them and scatter them around, he is one happy cat!",1
"3 cats, not one will even take one bite of these.",0
Nicely made. All pieces included. Went together just fine. Great design. Shipping box could have been sturdier. Would recommend.,1
"not very discreet, the sticky tabs are worthless, the screw buttons are going to tear my new couch and my cat just moved over 6 inches to scratch the middle of the couch...",0
My chihuahua loved these. She gets one every morning as her treat for going out. She hates it when the ground is frosty but for this she runs outside.  One bottle lasts a little dog two months as her serving is one a day,1
"very nice, A little fragile, some pieces broke off",1
"Tiny, bought it for my coonhound it fits my smallest dog perfect. Very disappointed.",0
"I purchased this item based on good reviews.  When it came to me, a good portion of it had leaked during delivery.  It also smelled AWFUL.  It smells like a very strong, institutional cleaner. It is not pleasant.  I went to return it and because it is classified as ""hazardous waste"" it cannot be returned.  It was a big waste of money!",0
"who would have guessed kitties like pumpkin, but mine do!!!",1
"We used it for our neighbor's noisy dogs (there is two of them) and at first it was like magic! With both dogs. But then after few days they  just ignored it. And now we are exactly where we were at first. The two stars are because in the beggining, it worked.",0
The product showed up on time exactly as described and my pug puppies love it!,1
"It works fine... but I've had it for about 24 hours and the motor has already started making noise.  It was quiet to start, but didn't take long to get loud.  The cats still drink from it but we had to move it because of the audible motor sound.",0
Purchased two tags for my dogs and they both look perfect. They engraving is just what I ordered and the sizes are just right for my dachshunds. They are a great value and came in very quickly. I will definitely order again.,1
"The jolly ball is the only thing I've given my dog that lasts. My dog has been trying to tear it apart for 3 months shy of a year and it's still going strong. Nothing else compares. Tuffy's: puffys, my dog destroys them in 20 minutes. Tennis balls: he destroys those too, but he also hides them to destroy and eat later. He can't hide jolly ball, because it's big and pink! I don't have to worry about leaving him outside with it, because a) he doesn't seem to be able to destroy it, and b) if I'm not there throwing it for him, then he'd rather play with something that he can destroy, like sticks or the wood on the outdoor furniture (bad boy!) I also like the size and elasticity of the ball, because I can kick it like a soccer ball. If you are worried that it is too hard, it gets a little softer as you break it in, though that doesn't seem to have compromised its integrity one bit. For comparison my dog is an energetic, 2 year old, 50# mutt with a little staffordshire terrier in him. I am 100% satisfied with the jolly ball and I rarely am with consumer items (that's why I'm taking the time to write a review). If/when he eventually destroys this ball I will get him a new one.",1
"The pet booster seat advertises ""sheepskin faux lining"" it does not come with that it comes with some thin material to try and pass for the sheepskin. Not happy with the false advertisement. It's also flimsy. Not happy at all. Returning for refund.",0
Works great with our puppy. He quickly learned how to use it after a few days of having it. Works on a sliding door and a regular door. It has significantly helped with potty training as he can tell us he wants out.,1
Very good quality.  Our dogs love them.  The sticks are thicker around then others that that I have purchased from other companies.,1
Very cute!,1
"The jury is still out  My dog absolutely hates this product.  I put it on and rub it in and it foams like soap.  I'm afraid it's hurting him.  He rushes away and rubs it off on everything he can.  Which as I read can actually damage and stain items.  I used eye drops immediately after to make sure I rinsed any of it out of his eyes (just in case).  My 2nd dog acted the same way.  So, if it's so safe and healthy, why are they reacting so crazy after using it on them?",0
Both my cats loved this toy.,1
I had a fussy cat with a poor appetite due to loss of a buddy. This food got him eating again. He is now back on a healthier food (Iams).,1
knock off,0
My dogs love these things.,1
The review isn't from me so ich as it is from my dog. She is crazy for her Greenie. She love's them. I love the nice price.,1
"I have a 9 lb mixed breed dog. When we got the seat we put it on the couch where he naps and put him in it. He smelled around for a bit, then curled up and took a nap. We moved it around to a few different places and wherever we put it he would get in and lay down. After about a week we were taking him out, so we put it in the back seat and hooked him in. He whined for the entire 20 minute drive. It was about 2 weeks before we were taking him in the car again, but this time was a 2 day road trip. He whined off and on for a couple of hours, but after that he was quiet. He looked out the window some, and slept some. But the miracle came when I had to leave him in the car by himself for a minute. Usually he loses his mind, tries to get out of the car with me, and cries really bad the entire time I'm gone. This time of course he couldn't get out. But he was completely calm. He didn't make a peep. He calmly watched me walk away. When I got back into the car he was equally as calm. It was AMAZING! I had my doubts after that first short trip, but after spending 2 days on the road with this seat I'm a believer. Before the seat he was always either in my lap or trying to sneak over to my lap while I was driving. Now he's safe in case of an accident, but also apparently feels more secure.",1
"Top piece completely useless but nice color and new cap apparently lives sisal. Poor construction, though. Ant serios cat would dismantle it.",0
"Great shampoo, mild and therapeutic for dry skin.",1
Bought this bow for a 10 lbs Jack Russell Terrier. It fit perfectly for his neck with a little room to spare.,1
My dogs would not even try it too many spices wouldnt mix well very disappointed in my he product line also tried the goats milk wouldnt mix very lumpy  can only half full very disappointed,0
This spray has been very helpful in stopping our little male dog from remarking his disallowed preferred areas. Highly recommend!,1
Way cheaper at Walmart for a larger item,0
"I am so lucky to have found Dermacept.  My little 4 yr old Shitz Shu girl has had seasonal allergies since I got her at 2 yrs old.  It got so bad her fur was falling out in patches and you can see the raw skin from all the scratching.  Not to mention to see & feel the suffering she was going through.  I believe in Holistic medicine for my family and it extends to my fur babies.  After searching & finding Dermacept on the net, I followed the dosage recommendations and gave her 1 full tablet for first 5 days and then taper down to 1/2 tablet after that.  Her symptoms were so severe that I kept her on full dosage for a month and slowly she got better.  If you read the web site, they also tell you that it may take a month or more to see results. Holistic medicine or supplements are not like conventional meds, it is a gradual process because it is basically assisting your body to heal itself.  Well, when I noticed that the scratching begin to slowly subside, I was so relieved and I have been using Dermacept ever since.  What I have learned since then is that you can technically stop giving the supplement when you no longer see grass growing during the coldest winter months, but you must start giving your pet the supplement at least a month in advance before the anticipation of spring plants growing (I had to learn the hard way).  This way it will save your little one a lot of unnecessary suffering. $35.00 for a 3 month supply (more if 1/2 dose) is a bargain especially if you compare it to vet bills and the really bad side effects of steroids. I now give Dermacept year round and will may even give it to my other pets as a maintenance vitamin since it is full of antioxidants.",1
I'm a certified groomer and have paid hundreds for grooming shears. This pair is as good as any of the high priced ones I've bought. Would buy these again.,1
"I've also only seen a few reviews here from cat-owners and they say 'My cats don't like it'.  My cat hate this.
But it works pretty good. You've got to grab them, hold them down and smear it on their teeth and gums as best you can before...",1
Has held up to months of use. Good thick fabric and very sturdy.the zippers have also held up very well.,1
"Ordered 1k super worms 2 days ago. I wasn't supposed to get them til may 4-7th, and I received them today! They all look good and healthy. Didn't have one dead one. Thank you!!",1
So far so good. My dog loves it. I just hope it washes well.,1
Great product!  Our 4 month old golden retriever does very well with this bully stick.  He loves it and experienced no adverse side affects.  I have purchased this product three times.,1
"The covers ups are pretty for my little girl dog. Shes a 11 pound cross of pom and chi. I measured her before ordering as recommended yet these cover ups run small. I tried them on her but I didn't seal the Velcro tight because they just seemed like they weren't fitting right. The first night she wore them she didn't even want to walk around in them. The second night she wore them, the next morning I woke up and she had them off and they were laying on the bed. I will need to get the next bigger size. These ones just don't work.",0
"My little girls love their ""toothbrushes.""  These are a good size for them (they're about 10 pounds).",1
Cute little cage; not sturdy and hasn't held up.,0
My pug only gets Honest Kitchen treats.  She loves then and I feel good about giving them to her because I know the ingredients are healthy and great.,1
My girl refuses for me to put this back in her mouth,0
This gate is a very effective gate. Easy to put together and affordable. Looks great as well! Would highly recommend it!,1
none of my 4 kittens wanted to eat this neither did momma cat.,0
"Had  heard so much about these and knew them to be SAFE stainless made in the USA.  However, dish held only 7 oz of water, not 8  and was very lightweight.  Tried and tried  and tried to obtain info from Platinum Pets Customer service about other sizes and possibilities.  They were not the slightest bit helpful (gave the impression they didn't really care)  and I finally gave up.  The search for appropriately shaped, made in USA, stainless pet bowls continues. Meanwhile I am sticking with human china bowls for safety",0
"Collar works really well, especially for the price.  My dogs hear the warning tone now and stop immediately.  I only have them wear them every other day and they still don't bark.  The beagle whimpers a little but what a change!  My neighbors really like the peace and quiet also!.  Great so far.

===UPDATE===
After less than a year, one of the collars short-circuited on our dog.  He was walking through the yard when it started shocking him.  When we ripped it off him, it shocked us!  Gave the dog first degree burns on his throat and severely traumatized him.  Took us a week to coax him back into his regular collar.  Ridiculous!  There should be a safety default to open the circuit instead of constantly shocking.",0
god product at a reasonable price.,1
Is clean and as advertised,1
Very cute.,1
Absolutely crappy product. Ordered it and used it for 2 days and it stopped working. Rinsed the filter and did a little bit of fiddling with it and it started back up. Day 3 it completely stopped working and no matter what it won't come back on. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!,0
Just a hard rawhide twist. My small dogs do not like. Will not eat. A waste. I gave them to my niece for her big dog who loves them.,0
"Didn't work for my dog, it got rid of some worms but not all worms",0
"I didn't realize that it was in the shape of a paw.  So when you point it far away it because GIANT.  My cats, who usually love laser pointers, are not interested. Can't return because I'd only get $3 back.  Total waste of $9.",0
"One cat digs it, the other just stares at the other cat who digs it...",1
We moved into a house where cats had a back bedroom to use...stinks when it gets warmer in that room. This did nothing to remove the smell. NOTHING.,0
Dogs hate them and they love the cesar food line ,0
"Does not keep rain off sides of bales, ruined bale.  When you read reviews on Chronicle of the Horse that talk about how the bale rotted inside the bale buddy within a day or two...you can believe it!  I'm very sad because I'd really hoped this was going to be as wonderful as advertised but I've used it exactly as pictured in the sales photo and it did not preserve the bale over a one day rain...it just molded quickly  :-(",0
"Love these.  They are easy to fill, but hold enough to last a few days for my 3 dogs.  I have one in their room and one in the kitchen.",1
You would have to be out of your mind to spend this much money on just the tank and stand. You can buy a 125 gallon tank at Tongs Tropical fish store for 300 dollars and the stand is another 300... i'd much rather spend 600+ tax than 2.2k,0
"Larger in size than I thought, would've like it to be smaller but it works well.",1
Purchased for a 5 gallon tank. Well made and UL Listed.  Water temp was running about 68 and this keeps it at about 71.  Not sure is would make sense in a 10 Gallon tank though.,1
Far smaller than advertised.,0
its so cute when my cat wears this. she hates it tho because it goes over her ears.,1
Great!!,1
This was returned,0
So fragrant that my cats run the moment I open the jar.,0
I love it....my food loving cat hasn't thrown up since he has been eating from this bowl,1
"Don't waste your time with this product.  My cats come right up to it and it doesn't activate.  It activates from a long distance away mostly by humans walking past it.  Not what I bought it for.  I wanted to keep the cats off of my ottoman but they can come up on it and walk past the can without being sprayed.  As soon as a person walks past the ottoman (not even on it mind you) it sprays!  The concept is a good one but the motion detector is poor so it's worthless.  Also, it won't work at night in low light conditions to keep my cats off of the ottoman after we go to bed either.",0
"My cat loves this bed. He took to it right away and sleeps in it all the time, more often than he sleeps on my bed or the other furniture. I have removed the pillow and washed and dried in the machines and it worked great and came out good as new.",1
The toy was a lot smaller than I expexted  Dog had a hole ripped in it in 5 mintutes!! I will never again recomend this company or buy another toy from them!,0
"We recently adopted a high energy mixed breed working dog (border collie/aussie etc.) and have been struggling to give him enough exercise each day.  I looked at this toy for about six weeks before ordering it because our little darling is a determined power chewer and can destroy ""indestructible"" toys in nothing flat.  I'm SO glad I finally ordered it!  Thanks to the Amazon community who -- once again -- helped me find a great product.  We've been using this toy now for about a month and it's still in great shape -- aside from being regularly soaked in saliva!  Our dog really, really, really loves this toy.  My husband gave it a funny name and plays with it using a funny voice, and as soon as our dog hears the toy name or special voice, he just goes crazy with excitement!  It's incredibly fun.  NOTE: If you have a young energetic dog like we do, work him up gradually and be alert to safety.  We recommend starting on grass or a soft carpet -- something a bit padded and with good traction.  We made the mistake of playing a few times on a hard wood floor and our hyper excited young little dog landed once or twice on his back.  After that he was afraid of the toy for a few days.  We started again gently keeping the toy trajectory low to the ground and playing only on grass and carpet.  We were also careful to avoid motions that would lead him to twist too much in the air before landing.  After a few days he was back to happy hyper excitement and leaping high in the air again like a crazy little daredevil.  After a month he is so skilled and coordinated that we don't worry about bad landings anymore.  His eye-object-mouth coordination has improved, he is better at catching (and releasing!) frizbees and balls, and we can see him paying attention to how he lands.  It has made a real difference in his coordination and balance.  It's a great toy for little dog athletes-- as good a discovery as the wonderful Chuck-it Glowball.  I can't say enough good things about it.  And tough?  No problems at all so far -- it's still in great shape.  My husband has taken to using the replacement teaser toy by hand as a quick fun break indoors when he is at his computer and out dog is with him. One other tip: try using an old coat and gloves the first couple weeks if you play outside.  Our dog got so excited he got a little careless with his teeth when were were taking it away from him, and he also wanted to bounce off of us at first as he lept up and down.  Wonderful, wonderful toy to exhaust and entertain your dog while entertaining but not exhausting yourself!",1
"Within a week of opening, the crickets began to rot, showing signs of mold and fungus and a foul smell.  Much too moist. Be sure to refrigerate, or perhaps freeze.  As to the shape of the crickets, they are basically the thorax, the appendages are missing.

If you are attempting to use these as food for surface feeding fish look elsewhere as they sink immediately.",0
great cage works just as good as expensive ones!,1
What can I say--my dog loves her treats.,1
This Recovery Cone was not as described so we had to send it back. It is a nice collar and if I need another one I might reorder in probably two sizes larger at least for just an average sized cat because that is how much too small it runs. We had to send this one back and I couldn''t wait for a replacement & had to go to the local vet to get one and pay the extra there.,0
"This may sound gross, but we use these in the house for 'wipes' because we have septic system and cannot flush the 'flushable' wipes or any feminine hygiene products  (I hear they are bad for regular plumbing too) so we use these to collect the wipe, knot the bag, toss in the trash so they don't stink and we don't ruin our septic system!",1
A little thick  but works great for a larger dog.,1
"My kittens seem to really like they tree, they love climbing up the scratching poles and wrestling and sleeping on it. As stated in most reviews this tree is rather small. Definitely for smaller cats or kittens. I wouldn't recommend for larger cats. It's easy to put together by yourself, its sturdy, not wobbly.  The only issue is that they keep knocking the hammock off when they jump on it. But that's as easy fix as long as you tighten and close up the hooks they sit on.",1
Gave both of my dogs diarrhea.  Kudos to Amazon for refunding my money.,0
"Worked fine, but the larger of our 2 cats is 13# and he seemed to start scratching again after about 3 weeks. We'll re-apply and see what next months does.",1
"I love this hoodie, it was so neat to see a name brand be turned into a doggy sweater brand ,but, i hate it. my dog is small and I got a small and the thing doesnt even fit my hand, they run very small, wish i knew that!!!!",0
"Only used a few times before the pins pushed into the pad.  Now they are all different lengths.  There are balls on the end of the pins, but they still feel a little rough on my hand.",0
"thought it would be a football as pictured, but it was a soccer ball.",0
"My dog loved this toy! Unfortunately, the fun only lasted for about an hour. The toy was easily torn apart and I had to take it away from my dog. He wasn't happy either.",0
Perfectseatprotectors.fits my  ford  focus nicely.,1
I have had one previously and it works great.,1
"One dog hates and one dog loves it. I'm very happy, since the dog that loves usually hates being brushed and since he is a husky he has to be brushed constantly. This makes it a better, happy brushing time.",1
Cats freak out for these!,1
Exactly what we wanted.  Fits the crate just right.  Washes out very nicely.  I would definitely order again.  The Standard Poodle loves it too!,1
"We love this crate. It folds down easily and is a good sturdy design. Love that it has the front and side door, to allow for placing the crate in a variety of locations.",1
"I loved the idea of an inflatable ecollar, thought it would work wonders for my cat post surgery. But this items description is way off, it says it fits an animals neck up to 6 inches, this could barely fit around two of my little fingers. The inflation opening is sealed shut you have to poke or cut a whole through it to inflate this. Also once inflated if you want to push the piece in so it won't sick out against your pet forget about it, it will not move.
Save yourself the hassle and just get a soft ecollar or a comfy cone.",0
Excellent nutrition for dogs,1
"So my dog is a bitch. Wife has everything decked out pink. So picture shows in pink but I got brown. No problem with me but I think it ships a random color. The only problem I had is the fact that it came in as ""new"" and despite the simple sealed plastic wrapper that someone with a heat gun or potato chip bag resealer can use to seal up the package, I ripped opened this sealed plastic wrapping and opened it up to find claw marks on it. Kinda iffy to me. But my dog will still leave her marks so I don't mind it. Just beware. I feel like to return and ship it back, it'll cost me more. So I will keep this ""new"" but used and color don't match just because I do not want to end up paying way more than I did. Be careful. You might open one with a hole and spend more money just to return it.",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I am not certain whether it works or not but the ""medicine-like"" odor is absolutely unbearable. Our dog sleeps with us in our bed, since I purchased this product and put the collar on our dog we have awakened each morning with severe headaches. I removed the collar and no more headaches. Additionally these collars come from some non-English writing country and are not what you actually see in the picture. I cannot possibly believe these things are safe long term for your pet.....they may prevent ticks and even kill them I do not know but the odor is intolerable.",0
"Awesome what you get for that price, I have my doubts on the specified gph, doesn't seem as powerfull as expected, good thing, all media is included, filter running is very silent, a bit of low quality on the plastic tubes and unions, that is all that I can say it's bad, but I will recommend this product to anyone.",1
life is good,1
Just as described.  Do I need to say I hate ringworm. lol,1
"I have two of these crates, one for each cat.  They are the perfect size and both of our cats just love having their own space.  The crates sit side-by-side with the doors open at all times and each cat will spend quite a lot of time napping inside on a daily basis.  I've made covers, cushions and bumper pads for each to personalize and make it homey for them.  This assures that when we really need to have the cats in them for travel or safety they aren't afraid and feel scared and ""locked up"".

The crates themselves are super easy to clean, are lightweight and fold down easily for storage.  I have them set up in a corner in our kitchen and being the small versions they don't take up a lot of space.",1
"My expectation was met with great satisfaction. Although it was meant for my Parrot cage, it was great to use in my Cockatiels bird house.",1
not made in usa returned them,0
My dog won't chew on it.,0
"I'm using this as a water pump for my cat's water bowl - it's perfect, as long as the pump is completely submerged in water, which is not at all unreasonable. If my fish still lived in a bowl, I'd get him one too.",1
Dogs love them!  Don't know what else to say.  It doesn't make the dogs explode or multiply if I give it to them after midnight so that is a good thing.,1
I love this stuff.  It works great and smells better!,1
"I just received this toy today, within 20 minutes a chunk had been pulled off (see attached picture) and more cracks were showing. My dog is a 45 lb german shorthair and he easily started tearing this apart.

Unless you have a 15-20 lb light chewer DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!

"Been ordering from Paw Struck on these 7 inch bully sticks for a bit now and have made them my go to purchase for the dog even if it is a bit expensive. Was disappointed this last time to see that all the bully sticks are about half the size of what they used to be. Now Im feeling like Im getting half the product for the same cost, which is no longer worth it to me. Is this an isolated situation or will it continue? Because Im really not interested in paying $100 for thin sticks. Some of them are thinner than my finger.",0
"I should've taken the reviews more seriously, and taken note that many of the positive reviews were given to them for free/discount.

It's cute and not an eye sore. It did not work at all for my 35lb goldendoodle pup, and didn't always light up either. Sometimes his ears would perk up but that's about it. Might just be the dog type, or the actual product. My neighbor has a 4lb Yorkie she is trying it out on, hopefully she can take it otherwise I'll try returning it. Thank you!",0
I didn't notice a difference. If anything my husband and I felt that it made one of our dogs even more hyper. Odd.,0
"Product as described, my cats love it.",1
Always works,1
"Bought this to replace a rw-4 that I had for about six months and stop working, after only 3 weeks this one to died so I returned it and decided not to take the chance with another.",0
"I love this vest for my two dogs both of my pups are not strong swimmers and they struggle with swimming but not anymore since we have these vests!  We just went paddle boarding and I have a running leash that i clip onto the vest and we get to safely play in the water!  It's well made and holding up well to the elements and my two tom boy dogs, no rashes either from the straps.  Great product and I'd get this again and I'm recommending it to my friends who have dogs.",1
Top quality for the money. Taste of the Wild my 9week old pitbull loves this. I recommend this dog food to other dog owners.,1
"Very easy to assemble, light bed.  Seems a little flimsy when picking it up to move it, but it is holding up well under my Goldie's 70 pounds.  It is much bigger than I expected.",1
I have bought two of these now. They are really well made except for the little plastic clip that goes under the dogs muzzle. The first one broke on our very first walk. The replacement halti broke after a few months. Same spot.,0
great,1
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I purchased this when I brought home a new puppy she was only 6weeks old. I used it once on my bedroom floors and it almost KILLED ME!!!! My nose bleed for 6 days straight each time huge plugs of blood would come out. When I when to pick up my puppy and play with her my hands and arms would swell and itch. I was about to give her away (thinking I was allergic)when my son asked me about the pet fresh. After about a month of suffering with  symptoms I finally had to go through what I had brought that was possibly making me sick. I bagged up the pet crap and throw it away. Vacuumed my floors 4 times a week to get rid of the residue of it. And found it was the pet fresh, my nose bleeds stopped and so did the swelling and itching. THANK GOD it didn't effect my puppy at all. This product doesn't list ingregents on the label or thier site. I wonder how many other people had had a problem with this along with thier pets.",0
"Being round, (my assumption) one of our cats refused to use it (she is finicky so no shock to me there). The other cat had no issues using it, but unfortunately the motor didn't last more than a month. I'm not sure what stinks worse, the cat box or the waste of money on this product.",0
"For $19 that i paid, i am quite suprised at the quality of these cubes. sturdy (i sat on one and it held me up like i sat on a low chair, am 126lbs right now) and not flimsy at all, easy to quickly put together and cats love them. one cat has already abandon his daytime sleeping spot and is constantly sleeping on top of one of these now.  if i had more room (home is already crowded with cat stuff galore), i would definitely rebuy more. The brown color matches well with dark wood furniture too, we have one in front of each end of our wall unit and it looks like these were made to be there.

4 stars only because both of the two i bought did not come with the hook on outside accessory/ball toy. i don't mind in the end though, they have plenty of toys but, If i had paid higher price, i would not be happy about not getting what is being advertised and what seems like some are getting but, other buyers like myself are not..

update: took a wet/damp papertowel to get hair off of top these and the paper towel turned reddish brown! same happen next two times. i would be a little cautious about buying these if you have a constant fabric/blanket licker. would watch when cats groom on it too for one of my kittens likes to groom himself on one of these and it usually gets material wet so i personally no longer allow him to groom himself on it to be safe.

update again: one by one all three of these ended up being thrown in trash over 3 mths ago (currently 6/8), i don't know what chemical/etc. scent is on these but, whatever it is, it enticed my cats to pee on each one of them. they have many loungers, toys, towers, scratchers and blankets and they have never peed on any of them, just the brown packaging paper and plastic bags on occassions! did really like these though, it is too bad cats thought they were for peeing on/in.",1
The dog chewed it right up.,0
Stinky but our pooch loves it.,1
Frontline really works well controlling ticks /fleas.  This is the second year I have used it and it really does keep my dog free from all those nasty pests.  I would definitely recommend.,1
"My dog popped it within 24 hours, worked great otherwise.  I didn't get my refund back because it was damaged.",0
"Amazingly easy to assemble, and nice quality. I'm using mine for a 17 pound dog so I put a piece of cardboard (from the box it came in) under the foam to give him a little more support. It's very solid on the window sill, especially if you put the supports on the second or third setting. I originally tried it on the first setting and it was just a little wiggly. Very happy with this purchase.",1
"BEWARE VERY DANGEROUS  I put this on my dog and within SECONDS, when he pulled, the harness broke and my cherished dog got out of the harness.  One of the seams gave out as if there was no stitching at all.  If we were in the street and he wanted to run, he could have been killed or seriously harmed.  This is likely NOT A PUPPIA HARNESS.  I have had many of Puppia harnesses with satisfaction, impressed with their strength.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS VERY VERY VERY DANGEROUS.",0
"Very pretty. Nicely made. Wish it felt a little more stable. Rocks just a tiny bit making my cat unsure of using the top... at least for now.
But you know how finicky cats can be.",1
"total waste of money. all my dog did was tear it up. he wasn't in anyway ""drawn"" to it other than curiosity to chew it up. Stick with the pads. it took FOREVER to get, and is ridiculosly priced as is shipping.",0
This is an awesome shedding tool,1
"My little dog tore his ACL and this supplement has made his recovery less painful.  Along with water therapy and limited activity, he his on the road to recovery!",1
Ive bought this bed twice now and its well loved. My chubby flame point Siamese (12 lbs but quite the fluffy cat) loves this bed and spends his night in it. He looks very cozy! I especially like how easy this cat bed is to clean. The pillow inside is removable and washable.,1

"DO NOT BUY

We purchased your product a few weeks ago. Since it's purchase and activation it continues to say not reporting. We have gone through all of the help documents and regardless of whether or not the product is in or outside, it is not reporting.
Currently, the lights indicate no GPS even though, according to the coverage maps on their site via Tmobile, we are located in a area with full 2g coverage. We purchased the tracker from amazon and are returning the as product is not reliable and does not work as advertised.

What is ridiculous is that in order to even know if the product will work you must sign up for service prior to even testing the tracker for reliability and accuracy. Additionally, the only way to contact support is via a pre-generated contact us email form that continues to recommend you to a place on the help blog and never actually responds. According to their website they cannot (will not) refund amounts of purchased plans once paid for and in order to discover whether or not the tracker works you must purchase the service plans!

The website is misleading with information it provides to the consumer and makes it really hard to understand your options with purchasing service.

I am very tech savvy and have worked with several other tracking devices (very successfully) and was hoping this would work to track my pet effectively and accurately, needless to say this product is not one I would recommend at all!

Additionally, customer service is horrible, they only communicate via email and even then do not seem to resolve the problems with applicable answers. They also takes days to respond!

If you value your money and do not want to lose it: DO NOT BUY",0
"We used this to allow our indoor cat to go outside safely AND we put the litter box outside.
Had handyman install a cat door in the house.  He cut a small hole in the back of rabbit hutch.
Boom.
Litter box is outside.
Easy to clean.
Odor is outside.
Bonus...the cat can safely go outdoors and watch over the backyard.
We installed a bird feeder near the hutch... kinda live TV for the cat.",1
The big ring on the inside is a big drag so we just threw it away and bought a different one at the pet store. Recommendation: don't buy.,0
This is a bad service for 9.99  Sucks,0
"I was excited about this product, but you need to pull your puppy's head thru it, wide, not adjustable fabric around the neck. Not a good option for puppies that are growing fast. I couldn't use it even once. I went to the Petsmart and bought him another harness.",0
"This is by far the best cat food we have found without grains, and a high protein percentage. The cat food industry in general has contributed more to the development of diabetes in cats than any other factor.  I will gladly buy Natures variety cat food to lessen the chances of my cats developing that disease.",1
"Unfortunately, this harness lasted less than three hours with our two pups. That is mostly because of the fact that our pups like chewing collars and harnesses off of each other, but since it lasted so little time, I can't properly give it a good review. It didn't last long enough for me to establish quality.",0
I first purchased these from my Vet's office and they were soft as stated. The ones I received from you are hard and dry but since my dog is not fussy he eats them anyway. I could use the ones from my Vet to push his daily AM pill in and that was great. The ones from you I have to use a knife tip to cut a cross into in order to insert the pill and then they want to crumble if I'm not careful. I will not order them from you again but will pay the slightly higher price from my Vet's office.,0

"I didn't get mine from amazon, it is actually sold for like $5 at CVS. When I opened it, it was already broken. The clip was cracked. The clip was really cheap and flimsy anyway but I wanted to use it for the time being until I get something else. It doesn't seem very comfortable or practical. Not to use for an animal over 10 pounds, just rescued a yorkie who is 6 pounds so she fit and it didn't fold on her but wouldn't even try to use for my doxie who is over 10 pounds.",0
"Overall: This is an excellent product and great choice to make. This product is MUCH SAFER to use than the fuzzy polyester snuggle hut that is sold. I have 2 green cheek conures and they love this seagrass snuggle hut. One bird was slightly afraid to use it at first, but that same bird also never had experienced any sort of hide-away in his cage before this eitherand after leaving the product in the cage for a week the bird that was a little afraid of the hut at first has also warmed up to using it and now both of my green cheek conures easily fit in the snuggle hut and happily enjoy crawling into the snuggle hut for a nap or to chew on it a little. This particular sea grass snuggle hut isn't huge, and Im not sure if they sell a large version. So Im pretty sure any small/medium bird like budgies, conures, cockatiels, could fit in this product. This product is definitely not for a fully grown African Gray or Macaw unless they're small babies (and will eventually outgrow this hut). The only downside to this product that I can think of (and it still isn't an issue for me yet), is IF your bird chew this toy up, the toy has some structural wire holding its safe together, and at that point I wouldnt think the exposed wire is safe and you should simply throw out the used-up toy and get another.

Recommendation to other bird owners: This product COULD encourage some nesting behaviors, especially if you have two birds in the same cage. If you want to try to avoid that, then I still would highly recommend the product, but I just wouldnt cover it up with anything like a small towel, and I wouldnt put any bedding inside of the snuggle hut, and I wouldnt put the hut in a corner of the cage so that it feels like it has 3 walls around itthat way this snuggle hut hopefully seem like less of a nest and more of a great place to hide and snuggle and sleep. No promises though, a product like this could encourage any behavior in birds since they're all different. And no matter what, I still recommend any bird/parrot owner to try out this product. If it doesnt work out then worst case return it, or gift it, or sell it, or maybe try it out again later on to see if your birds opinion of the product has changed. Ill also reiterate that this bird hut is SAFE(er), but still not perfect and nothing really is perfect, as this snuggle hut is using natural sea grass instead of using the fuzzy polyester fibers on the alternative snuggle hut (which is NOT safe). As far as I know, no bird has died or become sick from this sea grass snuggle hut, and a VERY large specialty bird store near my house only sells this sea grass snuggle hut, and they always advise people to NOT buy the fuzzy polyester snuggle hut. The competitors polyester fuzzy snuggle hut has fibers that could *literally* KILL your bird if it tries to eat lots of the polyester fibers. Be warned...polyester fibers WILL get stuck in your birds gut and the bird will not be able to poop these fibers out (its especially bad for smaller/medium birds), and if your bird eats a lot of the polyester fibers (in the competitors product) then your bird could die from their gut getting clogged up by these fibers Birds eating the polyester fibers of the other snuggle hut HAVE ACTUALLY DIED and you don't want to be the person who killed your bird through good intentions and a simple and avoidable mistake. As with ANY toy...be sure you supervise your bird(s) with it to make sure they're not going to potentially harm themselves with it...especially before leaving the toy in your birds cage cage 24/7 when you're not around to watch all their actions.

To the other reviewers who rated this product lower than 5 stars:  I think this bird snuggle hut is amazing. Lets be real here...you should know what you're buying before you buy it, and you should also know the nature of birds in general; and I'll briefly speak to that. This same scenario applies when you buy any other bird product as well. To the folks lowering the rating on this item because their bird is scared of the item OR because their bird shredded it up....REALLY?...You're going to blame this type of product based on your birds personality?? EVERY BIRD HAS IT'S OWN UNIQUE PERSONALITY! Some are scared by the color red, some are scared by round objects with little holes in them, etc, etcSome birds love crunchy sounds and other birds hate crunchy sounds, etc. Why would you rate this product down because your bird is scared of it? I personally feel that if the product itself arrived as described and in good condition, then you got what you paid for. If your bird hated it, thats not really the products fault lol...You could probably buy 30 other totally different bird toys and your bird could hate any (or all) of them for any number of reasons... Also, this is a natural sea grass toy! Your bird might chew it up...but so what! ALL BIRDS love to chew and shred stuff up! (If you want to debate my choice of words ""all birds, then lets say MOST birds love to chew and shred). It's natural foraging for birds to explore with their beaks and play and shred this unit up. Again back to reality...you want to discredit this product because its a natural grass toy that your bird can play, sleep, and rest within and on top of, as well as chew it up and enjoy the product? If you wanted an indestructible bird product that lasts forever then buy them something hard and uncomfortable like plastic or potentially dangerous and cold and uncomfortable metal slabs (sarcasm)...I'm sure the plastic product will last a bit longer, and Im sure the indestructible yet overall crappy metal product will last unused forever but I doubt your bird will enjoy that as much as they might enjoy a snuggle hut like this particular sea grass product. Long story short, go into buying this product with the expectations that you might find yourself buying this same product in the near or distant future. But keep in mind that you'll find yourself buying it again because your bird loved having fun with it and you want your bird to be happy!

Good luck to all of my fellow avian owners and wishes of long and happy lives for all of our birds.",1
"I was encouraged by the ingredients on the bag and bought some.  I mixed old dog food with new dog food then after a week all Rachel Ray dog food.  Within a few days you could begin to notice that the dogs began to get a lighter color poop, not a good sign!  The dogs then got diarrhea  and began acting nervous.  They liked the food, we called it puppy smack, but it make them really sick.  Back to Iams and within a day they were regular and back to normal.",0
"I really love this carrier. The color is great. There is a zipper opening at the top that is big enough for my hand, but not for my cat to get out. It allows me to pet her, which is great for calming her down. I can also use it to throw in a treat if needed. I give four stars, and not five, only because  my four month old kitten will likely grow out of it eventually. It's fine for now, but may not be later. She'd still likely fit, but I doubt it will be as comfortable. I wish this particular color came in the larger size.",1
This product is tainted and made my dog sick!,0
The material is soft but seems like it would tear easily. The sizing most be a joke as i bought a large and got something that would fit a 20 pound dog. My Akita was not happy.,0
"I purchased this metal dome a few months ago and would NOT recommend it. In fact, I've purchased two other styles since this one. The metal swivel ring showed signs of rust after about 2 weeks. In the first week, my labrador pulled it out of the ground twice. by the 3rd week, the swivel ring didn't swivel very well. Before it was in use for even one month, the metal swivel had broken off entirely and it had been pulled out of the ground at least 4 times.

This is NOT the worst tie out stake on the market, by far.... however, I won't be purchasing it again and am contemplating steering clear of all Pet Champion products as a result of my use of this one.

Pros: If you use a mallet/hammer to stake it into the ground, the main pole is much sturdier than comparable models (others bend after a few hits; this one did not ""give"").

Cons: Poor overall quality; doesn't last.",0
"I absolutely love it, but it did arrive with a couple of rhinestones missing.",1
"This worked well on a Delta flight. We have a 20 lb miniature schnauzer. He couldn't stand up in the bag, but he also wasn't cramped while he was in the bag. We only used the bag to get on the plane. The staff on the plane didn't care much during the landing if he was in the bag.",1
Cute but it's too cropped so it's pointless in keeping my large dog's slobber off of my smaller dog.,0
This is a lot easier to use than other heated poultry waterer I have tried. I do recommend this product for people who live in the north. The only down side it has is the pan still gets dirty and has to be cleaned out. The removable can't get out all the yuck!,1
Love it! My cats had to get used to it but they seem to like it now.,1

"Deal of the century! Comes in four ""Not for resale"" thick plastic bags. For my use, that's great because the salt will harden up after being exposed to the air for awhile, so with four individual bags, I won't have to ""crumble the hard salt""- so much...
As for the salt? It's salt. It seems to dissolve fairly quick, BUT NOT INSTANTLY as some of the other reviewers seem to think it should.
I've been using Instant Ocean for years and never had any problems. EVER. If it were pepper, -that'd be a different story.",1

"I was helping a friend with some foster kittens and one of them definitely seemed like he wanted to explore rest of the house (they were being kept in a room at first) and we were hoping we could get him to take a controlled trip around first before he got into a ton of trouble. The 6 week old kitten barely fit in the harness (to be fair, he was bigger than the rest of the kittens too!) and really really hated it. But the bungee leash turned out to be a fun toy when hung around a doorknob. I've dealt with other cheaper cat harnesses, and this one seems just as good or better, so 4 stars in the end. :-)",1
"Don't buy this!! I had many problems with this. First, it would hardly stay in the opening and anytime it was touched it would break off. Food spilled and my mice got loose several times. Secondly, it doesn't do a very good job of dispensing. I bought it because when I used a food bowl, my mice would immediately take all the food out of it and spread it all through the cage. I was hoping this would stop it but it didn't. Lastly, I was out of town for a while and had someone watch my mice. One of them crawled into this container, got stuck, and died. If you're looking for a coffin for your small pet then I would recommend this but otherwise, not at all.",0

"Great for helping and controlling joint pain.  If used before a problem shows up in the joint, it help prevent a more serious  problem later on in your dog's joint.  Worth the cost.

I used this product on my 6 gallon fluval edge reef tank and my 12 gallon reef tank and it worked like magic! The instructions say to use one scoop per 10 gallons but i used about half a scoop on both my tanks and everything was fine. I did use an air pump for two days and then did a water change. I highly recommend this product if you are having trouble with cyanobacteria AKA red slime.,1
"This cat toy is cheap.  The wand does not say together and my kitten had the feathers out of it in like an hour.  The string is very cheap too.  I had a Da Bird that i purchased at Pet Co 2 years ago.  It was excellent.  It was also made to easily change the feathers.  The string was a heavy strand and the wand was made of very sturdy fiberglass.  I guess I thought that was what I was getting.  This new one is very cheap and won't last very long,  Save your money!!",0
"When it works for a dog, it works great and quickly.  It's not a cure all for every symptom though.  I have given it to male and female dogs and for small dogs or dogs prone to urinary tract issues, a daily dose seems preventative.  They don't seem to mind it in small quantities in their food but it can be too much for some dogs.",1
So nice to find a collar that doesn't require batteries. Our new American Bulldog puppy was trained for the most part in just 8 weeks. Housebroken 80%. Very impressed with this collar.,1
Product was great! Have had no problems.,1
My GSD continuously got his tag holders hung on something and would loose his dog tags. I bought 2 of these for each of my GSDs who continuously play outside and they have not lost any more tags! I have 3 tags on each one.,1

"i like this.  my dog doesn't care necessarily for it, though, and she has learned that she can scrape it off.  although she has raced along a chain link fence to remove it, the coat remains undamaged.  i feel it is well made, and fits better than its boxy shape might suggest.  the velcro across the chest and around the belly offer excellent custom fit.  the soft fleece interior seems to me like it should be comfortable and cozy.  the exterior trim and paw print are reflective, which i like for safety.  it is not crinkly or noisy.  it appears to be intended to be reversible, but care would have to be taken to completely cover the prickly side of the velcro if it were put on with the fleece on the outside.

it is fairly light for a coat.  if it were a human garment, i would call it a medium weight jacket rather than a coat.

my silly bare naked dog just doesn't seem to mind being horribly cold.  i certainly do!",1
"My dog is a diabetic, so I'm not able to her this duck treats. Why did they have to change the product??? My dogs like them the way they were.
Go back to the old product
This is such a shame",0
"Awesome. got the bulbs and i never thought they would grow. well they have started growing and just a few weeks later they are tall, full of life and look just as the picture. Got to my house fast after i had ordered. I like so much I have ordered more!",1
"its size pellet is too big for medium discus, and makes water cloudy. however, the catfish and plesco like it.",0
I love KONG everything except this. My eager hard chewing Lab ate through this in less than 3 minutes. He was down to the bare rubber in 5 minutes. Back it goes. Not for hard chewers.,0
Koi fish did not like it,0
These are great boxes and very sturdy,1
"made out of particle board
not worth the money, no challenge for pets",0
"Unfortunately, this product is now made in China, so I no longer buy this product for my dogs, since China tends to add garbage to pet treats.",0
I use these beds in my dogs' crates and they fit perfectly.  They are nice and just like a cushion.  They wash beautifully and I just drip dry them.  I actually bought two sets so I won't be without them while one is being washed.  The dogs love them.,1
"We got this for our golden retriever puppy, she climbed right out of it using the holes in the sides. May be good for a small dog, but not a puppy that can climb!!! We even bought the net that velcros on top, she busted through that too!!",0
Very bright green large and fluffy.,1
"My little Chihuahua dachshund mix puppy had this chewed to pieces before she had it 24 hours.  Very poorly constructed toy. And NO, it is not ""VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTABLE""!  I feel I wasted my money on this ball.",0
"My finicky cat absolutely LOVES these, enough to make me stop what I'm doing to write this review. I was given these as a gift and soon thereafter I bought THREE more bags. I will keep buying them again and again. Using these, I have been able to train my cat to do things he previously refused to do, like actually sleep in his bed!",1
Never got any results... A total waste of money.... Total 0 stars... App made me put 1,0
"Very cheap nasty plastic.  Practically crumbles in your hand.  I have some older models that seem positively wonderful in comparison.
Extremely disappointed.  Pieces broke off as soon as it came out of the box.
I love these types of filters. Why can't they be built better?",0
Very heavy ball..my boston terrier chewed off the top layer in 10 minutes.  So much for durable. My tiny dog cheddar it up and so will yours,0
Did not produce any noticeable difference in cats breath or teeth.,0
"For the price, I'm super pleased. Have had for over a year and still just fine. Probably wouldn't work for a high energy dog or a dog suffering from separation anxiety where you would need something super sturdy in order to avoid break outs... But for a regular dog that's just gonna go inside and sleep- perfect.",1
Was seriously destroyed within first 20 minutes of my dog playing with it. He played with it by himself (no tugging) and had one of the squeak sections removed within that 20 minutes. I buy these toys so they'll last a little longer than the stuffed toys. This one obviously failed in that regard...,0
No effect on cat,0
Wish they were a little thicker but still work great!,1
These are FAR from odor free.,0
Quality was awful.  It is covered in cheap fake fur not carpeting.,0
"Cats love it - it always attracts them.
I have one cat who doesn't care about catnip - she's immune. But for those that react, it works and the price is great.",1
Cut color but didn't last long at all.,0
"So far so good, has held up to our 4 cat household. The only downside is that the base is a little thin.  The cats tip it over if the corner is not shoved underneath our aquarium stand.",1
took the dog a minute or two before it was gone,0
Used item 3X & the lining COMPLETELY disintegrated. Back seat of new car looks like handfuls of flour were thrown. Cheap fabric used to line an otherwise great product. I am NOT happy about it!,0
"This is obviously a scam. There isn't an animal small enough to fit in it and play let alone a small rat or hamster, it came well packaged, even taken apart for safety and came in an oversized box, but overall it's good for nothing at all but maybe putting catnip in it and letting cats bat it around, it's about as big as a cat ball like those that come on cat scratchers... ridiculous waste of money, even 3.00 is a waste. If you have other uses for something like this other than animals (maybe a goldfish isolation chamber?) then it may be worth it but for me I wanted a pet ball, and this is a miniaturized one at best that serves no real purpose because it's too tiny.",0
"This are indeed the 2+ inch version, and oddly the cats do not like it as much as the smaller 1 inch versions.  So suffice to say if you have picky cats then I would suggest that you avoid these...",0
"Very well made product! I have a 120lbs newfoundland so trust me when i say this brush gets a LOT of use! We have used the furminator brand before (had The medium and the extra large) however after a few months of normal use, it would break apart. So I decided to give this a try and i am so pleased! Its sturdier than furminator and works just as well, if not a little better. It doesn't have the push release button which pushes the hair out of the comb for you, but seriously thats no biggie to me. I never used that feature on the furminators any how as it seemed easier to just do it with my hand. I love this and will happily stay with this company for good!",1
did not work for my dog,0
"had fleas in my apartment (i was getting bitten every night for a week, managed to kill a couple with my hands but problem persisted)... this solved the problem. just sprayed it on the carpet all over the place, and then vacuumed. haven't had a flea bite since. fleas and ants seem to die on contact, and it doesnt stink like other sprays do. i can spray it on my carpet, vacuum and the room is nice n fresh. no nasty fumes i can smell. spiders seem to be tougher to take down, but they die. just not as quickly. good stuff, good price. i have tons of it left; im just waiting for the next invasion...",1
"It's kind of shallow, but it's still cute and I love the rubber bottoms. They really help prevent sliding on my linoleum!",1
works well,1
My birds love it - I have even attracted new visitors (pictured).  These pair perch by the log all day.,1
"Purchased for 11 month old lab. Vibration annoying to dogs ears, made mine crazy and none responsive. Dog cant understand where noise was coming from. I felt the unit was inconsistant. Not good for effective training. Shocked myself several times only felt it tingle on highest setting. Time spent with dog is more effective than collar training.",0
My dog enjoyed them. Would purchase again.,1
"This ramp will barely hold 100 pounds and is narrow, it broke within a year. I would not buy again or recommend",0
"This is the second time I've given Wisdom Panel a try, and twice the results were laughable. For both dogs I tested, the mother was a known breed; only the father was in question. Wisdom Panel did find the mother's breed in the sample, but at a tiny percentage; the rest of the breeds they included were simply crazy. The thing I find most unbelievable is that the results include uncommon breeds like Shar-pei, Chow, and Swiss Shepherd in the mix: these types of breeds are not exactly prevalent in most areas, nor are they running the streets to mate with other dogs on the fly!

DNA testing is entertaining, but I don't think the underlying data they use is complete enough to give meaningful results yet. I bought this for fifty bucks so I don't feel too ripped off.  Two stars for the test itself: easy to use, processed in about 3 weeks, and online reports are fine. The photo below is my half-Border-Collie that they say is mostly Dalmatian!",0
good,0
"I bought this for my russian, I got the XL, which is a good size for him.  HOWEVER, he could not get into it without help.  He actually attempted to get inside of it for almost five minutes, we had to add dirt to the ramp so he can get in.  I  joined a forum for tortoise owners and they call it the death trap.  Tortoises have been known to flip on their backs and drown in these bowls.  A terra cotta planter bottom works so much better.  RETURNING IT! This is not worth me putting my tortoise in danger.",0
Great bed for our small cat! She loves it so much that she stays on it almost 24-7!,1
"The hinge of the front door/flap is so tiny and made of cheap-malleable plastic it didn't have a chance of ever working.  Unsurprisingly since returning my purchase, I started noticing this model at other people's houses.  In every case the door flap is laying off to the side.",0
Nice! Fit my boston good.we got a medium.,1
adorable but broke the 1st day. I have a pug though and he has a very broad chest so maybe that's why.,0
"My dogs hate them and won't even sniff at them. BUT my granddaughter's dog loves them. I don't know why but it seems the Dodd that love them, really love them and those that don't, don't!",1
fine - ok,1
"Such a pretty picture and harmless name. This is a tool for hurting dogs at a distance. It might well traumatise your dog out of doing what it was doing when you pressed the button, but the behavioural side effects are not worth it. Besides, it's just mean and unnecessary. There are smarter ways to train your dog.",0
"My cats don't like this very much. I got it May 21st (it's June 29th now). I've left it out every day and I have four cats. Usually, they can go through a 10 lb. bag in a little over a week. Plus, I have a stray I feed outside. I'd estimate they've eaten a third of it in five weeks - probably time to throw it out.

It looks like it should be healthy and many cats like it but mine don't. Maybe I just got a bad bag? They'll eat Meow Mix and Iams with no problem. That's mainly what they've been eating the last few weeks plus canned food. Although, their all-time favorite is Call of The Wild. I'll probably get that next time since I know they will eat it.",0
They LOVE this food. All three of my cats enjoy this one. They also eat the beef one.,1
Too hard for my kitten.  Did not play with them,0
My cat loves it,1
The shampoo got delivered with no type of seal on it. The product seemed extremely watered down.,0
"I have tried everything from scoot bars to pumpkin, nothing worked, it was costing me $25 a month at the vet do have my pug's gland expressed, until I tried Glandex. This production is amazing. I am a lifetime customer!",1
"I had to return the collar. Sometimes when i would press a button (beep or shock) it wouldn't relay the signal to the receiver. I just can't have that happen. What if my dog was getting near a moving car and i had to call him back with the beep and it didn't work? I could have just gotten a bad one, but other reviews have listed this as a problem as well.

The other thing i didn't like was that the tone volume was too low.

I have since bought the Sportdog 400&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SportDOG-FieldTrainer-400/dp/B000EFL0A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SportDOG FieldTrainer 400</a>. So far it has worked flawlessly and the tone is a little louder than this one is. No communication problems at all, i would recommend that one over this by far. That one also has a 25ft water resist on it, the Petsafe Yard and Park has no water protection. The Sportdog 400 is far better if you are serious about training your dog and keeping them out of harms way.",0
I ordered 100 roaches for my bearded dragon and there were less than 50 in the bag. I will be ordering elsewhere next time.,0
"Not worth the time it will take you to have to ship it back. It came rusted and the wheels didn't work. It was not user friendly to fold to put into car. You get what you pay for. If you want a much better, easier and awesome pet stroller, get the Pet Gear. I paid $160 for it and I use it all the time for my chihuahua. Easy to fold with only one hand and the wheels are constructed much better. Thank you -Jeanette",0
My dogs absolutely loved this but managed to completely chew through it in about two days. I was very disappointed.,0
the reason of 1 star . my dog won't touch it!,0
"I like it. the dog hasn't chewed it up, it's the best value for a low budget harness i could find. nice work, guys.",1
"I've had to replace this quite a few times now because the motor stops working. I've attempted what others have mention to make sure no gunk is stuck, but there never is any in there. Very disappointing.",0
Did not work for my dog and I did not like that it left wax all over my floors where my dog was walking.,0
Goof quality!,1
"This information needs to be known. I used this product right after adding Seachem Prime and found out that I pretty much have been WASTING this product. This is information posted by Tetra to an aquarium forum:

First, ideally you should set up the tank, and let
it run at least 24 hours, then, shortly before you head off to the store
for your first fish, add TSS to the tank. Within two hours, you should
add the fish. Our normal recommendation is to add one small fish per
ten gallons of water. However, you CAN fully stock the tank, you just
need to keep a close eye on it, and be sure to not complicate matters by
overfeeding as well. We recommend this method for African cichlid tanks
since it is best to fully stock such a tank from the beginning due to
territorial issues. For a novice fish-keeper, we'd recommend the one
small fish per ten gallons rule for the first two weeks. Within two
weeks, TSS should have fully cycled the tank and they can start slowly
adding more fish, one at a time.

In regards to ammonia products, yes, they kill TSS. Any type, whether a
chloramines remover or detoxifier, etc, anything that says it locks up
ammonia or removes ammonia. Do not add TSS for 24 hours after using
such a product, and do not add such a product for at least 7 days after
using TSS. The bacteria is housed in a special stabilized solution of
ammonia, so if you remove/lock up the ammonia, you remove all of the
food the bacteria require to live.

If you already have fish, and are having an ammonia issue, it is best to
get the ammonia levels down to below 4.0. 4.0 and higher is just as
toxic to TSS as it is to fish. While 2.0 -3.5 PPM ammonia may harm some
of the TSS bacteria, it should still have some effect. You may want to
do a second dose several days after adding the first one, if you are not
seeing the results you want. Keep in mind, these are bacteria, not a
chemical, so results are slow to see. Give the product at least 5-7
days.

Best temperature for TSS is between 40 and 80 degrees. Freezing and
extreme heat will destroy it. Refrigeration is okay, but not necessary.

You can test the water any time, but really, you should probably wait at
least 48 hours. We expect TSS to start slowly seeding the tank, and
making a difference in about that time. You have to have some ammonia
occur in the tank to provide the cycle needed, so it will usually create
levels or reduce levels to around 1.0-1.5 ppm, and they should stay
there for a week to 14 days, and then come down. Sorry, these levels
would be for both ammonia and nitrite. These are considered stress, but
not toxic, levels, and should not cause any long term damage to the
fish.

We recommend waiting two weeks before a water change. Of course, if for
some reason, the levels go up to a high level again, we would recommend
a change at that point, and another dose. Usually, the hobbyist has
done something wrong the first time, in such cases.

Nope, bacteria should not affect the pH.

Hmmm....be sure the levels are not already toxic, shake the container
thoroughly, be sure to add the right dosage, do not use an ammonia
detoxifying product, and be patient. It won't give you zero readings in
an hour, like some folks think. By the way, carbon does not affect it
but uv lights do...we get those questions too. :-) And just an
interesting point...the large aquariums, such as the Georgia Aquarium,
and the Shedd Aquarium, as well as huge research labs in this country
and other countries, also use TSS as well as the saltwater version Bio
Spira.

If I have not addressed all of your questions, please let me know.

Tetra Care",1
This collar fits our dog well. Love it!,1
beautiful collar,1
My cat loved 'em!,1
Everything is great but the lanyard makes no sense and is a waste. What you think disabled people are going to wear a lanyard saying they are a service dog??!! We get enough discrimination without bad mouthing ourselves.,1
Toy lasted maybe 20 minutes. Not worth the money IMO.,0
"My dogs love the Toothpaste, one of the dogs asks to have her teeth brushed. Half the price compared to local [pet store.",1
"Item is TOO SMALL-for a M SIZE!
I will return shortly!",0
"This cage is junk. Not made for any dog that chews. (Puppies and almost any dog in general). Lasted a little over a month. Don't waste your money, just buy a metal cage.",0
"I love these little cups, they are perfect for persons like myself who enjoy bettas and have many small aquariums so the each have their own unique space. They allow for so much creativity.
I was so pleased to find something ""different"" than the forever sunken ships, treasure chests, skeletons, castles and logs, these are prefect and really allow my imagination a lot of latitude.",1
My three rat boys absolutely adore these!,1
"Used on both my dogs, a pitbull x and a catahoula x, one with very short fur and one with medium fur. Groomed both 2 days before, and the product was totally ineffective.",0
"Dogs Love It, bought 2!",1
"This seemed like a great product until my dog broke the line. There is no way this has a 920 pound break strength, I have a dog that weighs 75 pounds and he snapped it. This would be ok for smaller dogs under 50 pounds or so but be careful and watch your pet when he and she are on this line.",0
"Thought we would try a new kind of treat dispenser and chose this one.  My dog thought it was a joke.  No challenge, not interesting, and frankly she couldn't have cared less about it.  We're going back to her favorite kind.  I wouldn't waste my money on this one.",0
Gate is a great height for small dogs and is easy for children to safely step over.  Design could be greatly improved if the four rubber side feet were adjustable with a screw like many gates on the market.  The rubber feet just slide in so as to not allow for the best and tightest fit to the walls.  Good enough for a temporary solution.  We used felt chair pads to make up the extra space between the side feet and the wall.,0
My dog LOVES these treats and I like them because they're small and tasty. I can give him a few and not add too many calories as we're watching his waistline. Yum!,1
"My dog's favorite treat.  The grocery store stopped carrying them.  Nice size, about an inch across and not too thick.  Easy for my older dog to chew.",1
"Unfortunately this bark collar malfunctioned while on my dog and he was crying and shaking in the back yard as it was continually shocking him.  When I tried to get it off him, it shocked me too.  I did not feel comfortable putting another one of these on him again.",0
Great Nylabone to keep my 11 month old Vizsla busy. She's more interested in this bone than many of the other Nylabone products.,1
It's perfect fir house training and so easy to clean,1
Bought this for my dachshund.  Didn't take into account the neck size.  It was too small and puppy cannot wear.,0
Received the bigger size instead of the puppy food :(,0
"It is important to note that there are 30 pills in the container, but depending on your dogs size, much less doses. It only lasted 2 weeks for my medium sized dog. Also, he willing at the pill the first couple days after I playfully thew it around and got him excited. However, he refused to eat it after that and I had to put the pills in liverwurst. Because of this, I switched to the regular pills since they are smaller and more easily hidden.",0
Great,1
Love this light. You can turn on one or both sides. I have it on top of my exo terra 36 inch terrarium for my ball python.,1
"This is my 3rd cat washroom I've purchased. The first one for my daughter and the other two for my homes. It is fairly well made (ideally check for any scratches prior to assembling. There is 1 part of the instructions which is confusing and if you follow the steps precisely it will require re-work. Other than that, I would highly recommend. My young kitties like it too ;-)",1
"I love this product, the new bottle has made it a messy waste. They need to fix this.",0
"We have been using this for 7 days now.  I bought it for one of our cats in particular, but all the cats LOVE this stuff so they all eat it on top of their food.  We bought this to help with stinky cat poots.  One of our cats is constantly crop dusting the house and it's become rather embarrassing when guests are over. After a vet check to make sure nothing was wrong with KitKat, we decided to try a probiotic.  7 days later I haven't smell a KitKat toot in days. Added bonus the litter box isn't as smelly either!",1
"I thought these were the mini tennis balls, but they're not :( very disappointed, as they're way too big for my little dogs' mouths.",0
Usually Kong toys are the favorite brand of my fur boy but he has ignored this one since the first day.  He may rediscover it as he sometimes does. But it's a cute little bear.,1
great for you cats.  They do not leave any harmful residue behind.  Great for cleaning all kinds of cat stuff and of course using on your cats is safe,1
My little dogs did NOT like this so I will be donating the bag to the local shelter.,0
"Used to transport a small (but long) yorkie on a two hour Spirit airlines flight. He was anxious during take off and tried to get out but this carrier held him securely under the seat. Once we were in the air, he calmed down. Did the job.",1
This works wonders! I have two dogs and neither will go near this and back away from the can when they see me put it on the floor. I'm thrilled with the results.,1
"This has proven to be a godsend for our dogs.  I was so tired of constantly wiping up the moat that would develop around our dogs' water bowl that I was desperate to find something that would work.  Other trays had sides that bent back easily or bottoms that slip all over the tiled floor.  But this tray is sturdy and easy to clean - a winning combination in a house with 2 chihuahuas, a lab/beagle mix and German Shepherd.  Now the water stays inside the tray, the sides are holding up well several months into regular use and rinsing and washing it out as needed is easy peasy.  It's cheap and it works - stop comparison shopping and buy it.",1
"Bought this as a beginner tank for our 6 year old. 3 days after setting up and getting fish in tank, the light stopped working :( Cannot find a replacement anywhere for it, and do now want to send back the whole tank. Dissappointed on that side, but otherwise tank is good. The filter is a little loud but not too bad, just depends on water level",0
Worked well but I left it with my dog for 5 mins and he tore it to pieces. Didn't last though the first day I bought it. If you get this don't leave it with your dog it's not very durable.,0
Dog loves it! Fun to stuff with peanut butter and other treats.,1
"This cat tree is HORRIBLE.  It's poor quality, just some fuzzy fabric stapled to particle board.  If i had know, I could've made a better one myself.  It also did NOT come with screws to assemble it.
The instructions say (WITH these typos):

""NOTE:
1) please confiem all the parts when you get it.
2) plesae follows the digits tp build up the cat firniture step by step.""

BUYER BEWARE.  I'll be returning for a refund.  :(",0
