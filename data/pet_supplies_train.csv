"This product can in a timely manner and in perfect condition. My little toy poodle loves this playpen so much that she'd rather sleep in it, which shows me that it is very much so built for the comfort of pets.",1
Not too impressed.,0
"I'm using these as a replacement for the small filter bag that came with my ceramic cat fountain. Their size and shape offer greater surface area coverage and fit well in the space around my pump. I especially like that they have tight drawstrings rather than zippers, and the fact that there are four of them means they'll last a long, long time.",1
Too small even for one bunny.  Mine couldn't even stand up in it.,0
"Great at scaring off my cat but does absolutely nothing to stop her from doing the same thing later, sometimes even within minutes of using it. So its not exactly the deterrent I was hoping for.",0
Great dog food my dogs love it and haven't had any issues on it at all. I open feed my dogs and have been feeding them this dog for about a year now. As stated in several of the other reviews that there dogs have put on weight when switching to this dog food I have NOT had that issue. My dogs have stayed the same weight and they only go for walks 2-3 times a week and less that 2 miles on each walk. I would recommend this dog food to anyone who wants there dog eat well.,1
"This leash is as advertised. However, it is not for me.

There are not very many good uses for a heavy 30 foot leash. This will always be dragging along the ground, getting wet and muddy, tangling around legs, etc.

If i were to buy another 30 ft leash, I would something that keeps the leash taught so it doesn't drag along the ground.

This may be useful for tying a dog up in a yard, but remember that a dog tied up in the yard can choke itself and should never be left tied up alone.",0
Works Ok but the specification are ambiguous. I wanted a 12vDC pump and when this arrived I found it to be 12vAC. Had to return it.,0
I have a mini yorkie and she doesn't jump out or try to push it down. I'm trying really hard to potty train on pee pads and I think this will help drastically. I will prob buy the pee pad tray made by the same company soon.,1
fine for the price.,1
"So disappointed.  He is a medium in size for his disposable diapers.  But the medium is to small for him.  We were looking forward to having something that would stay on, when he crawls under things.  Great return tho.",0
My corgi loves loves his red bone...especially when I spray some Kong liver/bacon and cheese treats!,1
"After 2 months it burned up and causes a fire at the plug, thank god every thing was on a surge protector and its all that i lost.",0
3 out of my 4 cats will not touch this.  Pretty pricey for alot of gravy & grain & little meat.,0
"Good unit, wished I would have bought it sooner. I made a big mistake by not buying sooner. Do not make the same mistake I did.",1
Supposed to be tough  She tore it up in two days!!,0
"This filter works great when you first buy it. However, I can no longer get the main o-ring to seal and the canister leaks excessively.",0
My small dogs (10lbs) were afraid of the ball. We returned it.,0
"I had very high hopes for this system. I read so many positive reviews, and several negative ones. I know this had about a 50/50 shot of working. Sadly it failed in our home. We probably could have kept with it a little longer, but cleaning up cad feces and urine off my bathroom floor got old real fast!  He did great with the first step.. But as soon as we added the second step with a hole in the middle he began having more and more accidents. Then ultimately kwit the system all together. We're were so disappointed it didn't work out. Back to the litter box, which sucks to clean, but at least it's not all over my floor. Very very disappointed. And our cat is about 5 months old, so we had expected him to catch on quickly. Cats are just not meant to use the potty I guess.",0
cute but very tiny. my little one loves it.,1
Not as advertised.  It looks like a cave but it's more like a bed with a blanket on top.  Roof of cave does not stay up.  Very disappointed!,0
Not very durable. Have only had about 1 month and there's a hole in the area that the dog sleeps. If I wash it it may make it worse.,0
A very Good complement to dog food.,1
The plastic holding the shocked in collar broke after my dog wore it for the first time.  Wasn't even on for more of an hour.,0
"This thing sucks! The water pump is so weak, it barely moves the water. The tank kept getting rancid. I actually took the pump out and just put that in the water bath, which was better than nothing.",0
Our cats spend almost all their time on this jungle gym. They use all the posts to scratch which makes some of the carpeting come off; it still remains highly durable.,1
First bought a large my dog was still able to reach around it. Bought the x-large had it 2 weeks and it started ripping and my dog was able to bend it brought to still get at his back side.,0
It made stinky feet smell go away under her eyes!!,1
the lid does not fit well you have to pull it off rather than twish even though your supposed to twist but overall works great,1
This thing is worthless. I read great reviews but I can't see where any were legit. This has no power whatsoever and might be able to be used on a small kitten but I doubt it,0
Kitty loves it and so do I.,1
"I wanted to love this product and had hoped it would be better toys than the rope toys for my pups.  I have 2 Lab/Hound mixes that weigh in between 55lbs and 60lbs each.  I haven't even had the toys for a week and already one is destroyed and another is unraveliong.  These were advertised as toys for strong chewers but don't be fooled.  My dog not only chewed them apart in a day, but then ate some of the fleece pieces which lucklily he was able to throw up and not have it stuck in his system.  I won't ever purchase this product again.",0
Cat broke the maze toy after playing with it for one day!,0
"The sizes run large. However, I managed to make it work.",0
"item received does not look like the picture, no lining around the jack, thus it  scratches the boot, not good",0
My dogs hate this.  They run and hide when they see me with the container and then hide after I use it.  What a waste this was.,0
"The tool does what it's supposed to do. My dogs fur is too thick even after a thorough brushing for this to get through. I have a Bouvier with a very thick almost wool like coat. The teeth are too fine for him. A silkier coat, this would work great with...",0
"The quality of this product was not as expected. The product was much less sturdy and pale than the picture shows. Even though it is expected that size and color may vary, the picture looks very similar to a product I purchased at a local store in the past. The product I received does not. My dog is not very big, but the horn immediately started to break and fall apart once he began to chew it. It felt and sounded like concrete. I will purchase buffalo horns in the future, but it will not be this brand. I may just trash what is left.",0
Terrific customer service from PetSpy.,1
Noticed difference in 12 year old Doberman. She was starting to struggle with getting up and laying down. We've been using for about 6 months and now she doesn't strain getting up or laying down. Amazing stuff! Highly recommend!,1
Wrong type of Moss - my bad.,0
"For a one cat household this is a great litter box. I use the liners, actually 2 because our kitty makes holes in them, and it makes it very easy to scoop because the clumps don't stick. It is small enough to fit under a bench and very odor trapping. I use Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter and the combination is great.",1
the cats hated it...,0
My puppy hates the smell. She runs and tries to get rid of the smell when I spray her.,0
"I purchased two bottles. One was fine, the other was open. I threw the open bottle away.",0
Great product! Does exactly what it says it will do... highly recommend !,1
Works like it's supposed to and my blue crayfish thanks you!,1
This litter works well with the littermaid system. It clumps well and the cats seem to like the texture of it,1
These have been a great additions to aquarium! Their colors are vibrant and they have been very active and not skiddish like my other dwarf crayfish. They arrived in good shape due to the great packaging.,1
Have a yorkie/ chiwahwa mix and these would not even come close to going through his hair terrible!!,0
"Coolrunner should be ashamed of themselves, inserting Cesar Milan's name into a product that he has absolutely nothing to do with.  I have not purchased this lead, and it may be a very nice lead, I just don't like the false, misleading, and deceptive advertising that is being portrayed here.",0
Did nothing for my cat.,0
"Too small, the carpet is thin and the top is hard.  the cats won't go near it.",0
Dogs love it.,1
"This thing is unusable.  Using it with or with the cap, the cheap and dinky little sandpaper ring slips off within a second of touching the nail.  The stone itself is for fine grinding, and would take way too long.  Save your money and get a real dremel.",0
I really was expecting something more substantial... this thing is tiny and both of the squeakers popped within 5 minutes tops... I'm actually afraid of my dog just swallowing it and he's medium sized. But they sent me three in a package which I guess is cool. I'll pull him out a new one if he destroys the first (he's not too interested in it anymore without the squeak) and of course if he doesn't swallow it.,0
"I actually bought this as a gift, for a dog that I'm the caregiver for. She loves snuggling into the one at my home, so got her one. I have to say, this one is a lot more plush that the one I bought years ago. I may have to upgrade mine. My cat's love this, too.",1
These egg rings work wonders. Less oil popping and makes it very simple to cook over-easy eggs. I've also used them for pancakes and they work just a well.,1
So cute!  Great quality.,1
"Nice leash, build quality seems to be there. The traffic loop/handle (lower loop/handle near clasp) if perfect, right size and padded. Now the main loop/handle is too small and isn't padded. If they tweaked the design were the main loop/handle was the same size and had the same padding as the traffic loop/handle then this would probably be a 5 star lead/leash. Also upgrade the clasp and its a definite 5 star leash.",1
I never needed it so I have no idea if its a good item,1
Absolute trash! I bought two different sizes and my dog slips right out. She pulls it off forward so it's not on her snout. I got her to stop pulling out of the snout so now she just pulls backwards and slips the whole dam thing off. Trash!,0
Our dogs love this.,1
"I love it! I was without sleep for weeks because of my cat knocking on the door all night long, until I found the ssscat spray. It really works!",1
didn't work as expected,0
"The bottle says 60 tabs but there's  really just 58 tabs in it. If you buy this, make sure you count the tabs.",0
I have English bulldog and works excellent,1
have not used yet but i'm sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need,1
"DON TO BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT. HAVE BOUGHT THEM OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE I KNEW OF NO ALTERNATIVE. THEY WOULD EITHER STOP WORKING WITHIN 2 YEARS OR GET SO HOT THEY WOULD BURN THE KITTYS. THEN I WOULD HAVE TO THROUGH THEM OUT. I SHUDDER TO THINK HOW MUCH I SPENT REPLACING THEM OVER AND OVER. THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA CRAP.

If you want a well made ( in the USA) product that also makes heating mats for farmers...Google Kane. They have an 18 x 18 mat for pets that is well built AND they will repair it if need be. It cost a bit more but should last forever (or so).",0
"We ordered two 26 feet flexi long lead 3 leash but we received two 16 feet tape leashes.  We called and they admitted they sent the wrong item, said they would send the right ones with directions on how to return the incorrect leashes.  That was 3 weeks ago and we have heard NOTHING and NEVER received the correct item.  What a waste of money, effort and time.  Sadly the dogs still have NO GOOD 26 feet leashes.",0
Very strong smell after a short time.  Even one of my dogs didn't like it.,0
"Like most every other review I've read on here, everything was going fine with my cat and the CitiKitty up until the moment I cut the first hole. We have been stuck on the first, smallest hole now for the past 3 months. While my cat continues to urinate in the CitiKitty, she absolutely refuses to go #2 with it, and just goes in my bathtub. If I fill my bathtub up with water to prevent this she goes on the bathroom floor.

Many reviewers have mentioned 'the cleanup' that is required of this product, but I think the most gruesome details have been left out; yes, your cat will kick litter all over the floor of your bathroom; yes, when you need to move the CitiKitty to use the toilet yourself, you will spill cat litter all over your floor. But this is the easy stuff. What's really hard to deal with is the 'wet' litter. When your cat kicks at litter that has been urinated on, it gets stuck in all of the nooks and crannies of your toilet; wet litter will be caked around the entire rim of your toilet, where it meets the tile floor. Urine-soaked cat litter will adhere to the nuts and bolts of your toilet lid in the same pattern as you would see rust. It is nearly impossible to remove this, and requires a considerable amount of time on your hands and knees with Qtips and toothpicks. Even then, your toilet will never quite look the same.

My cat could not be more terrified of the tiny, black hole that is the smallest, first step of the CitiKitty. (which is natural enough, since it looks like the sort of thing a predator or a snake would jump out of.) This means that both before and after she urinates, she tries to 'bury' the hole by kicking 90% of the litter into it; so much so that I can't even flush it. So, you burn through litter about 5 times as fast as you would with a litter box.

""Things can get a bit messy"" is the most profound understatement ever made of any product made available on Amazon.com. You are essentially doing away with your litter box, and instead turning your entire bathroom into a litter box.

Even if this product eventually works - and it appears for many it has. I assume all the 5 start reviews are veterinarians of have PhDs in Feline Psychology or something.) you will have to do so much work deep-cleaning your bathroom and toilet, that a decade's worth of a litter-box free life still won't make up for it.

And this is why this product truly only deserves 1 star; not because it doesn't work and hasn't succeeded in training my cat; it's because for an additional penny's worth of plastic, they could have created ridges around the holes as well as the outer rims of the CitiKitty that would have prevented 90% of the litter from flying everywhere. They simply didn't care about how many hours you would have to spend on your knees digging urine-soaked cat litter out of every crevice of your toilet. They didn't feel it was worth the effort, and frankly now I don't think it's worth the effort to complete the training.",0
"So very cheap! And mean the price, not the product! I got 3 for the price I would have paid at a pet store!",1
Ball is very slippery when wet from your dog or snow.  The previous Powzer STAR BALL was much better.  This ball will puncture easily.,0
"Package arrived 2 days later than expected. The product box was used looking and barley closed. I opened the box to use the collars and they were opened. One was marked with permanent marker and they expired in January. They looked to have already been used. I tried to add a photo, but the link will not work.",0
Folds flat and unfolds to make a sturdy enclosure for my aging dachshund who needs to be confined. Tray is easy to remove and clean. I recommend this product as the best for the price under $40.,1
"The monster loves this thing, therefore I love this thing.  He usually inhales his meal in about 26 seconds and using this extends it to a good 15 minutes.  I have to vacuum a bit more now, but it's worth it!",1
Didn't work at all. Made tiny buzzing noise in the motor of the fan and smelt funny. Guessing its just my luck of the draw and not a totally sh*&ty product. Ill just 3D print my own and hope it works.,0
"I wouldn't give it any stars as then I wouldnt be able to comment. I bought this food as an upgrade to what I was feeding my dog. WIthout knowing the cause my dog was vomiting everyday sometimes twice. Soon after it happened I decided to search the internet to see if anyone else was having this problem. I found many search options which said that their dogs were experiencing the same issue. This is the search results you can read the proof here.[...]
I have contacted Amazon and they said they were going to stop selling it which I see they have not. I got a call from Blue Buffalo last night but was unable to take the call. They never called back. I am going to go through the expense of having the food tested. I plead with you to not buy this product or any others they make. Somewhere along the way (maybe when the company went public) things have changed. I will never use their food again",0
Works for cats too although I had to put it on a tray because they flick food out of it.  Much less vomiting now.,1
"WHAT IN THE WORLD?!?! WHY has the price on these gone ASTRONOMICAL? Holy cow!! It was bad enough when they started creeping from 1.79 to 1.99+...and now this?
My kids love these things - even the one who used to not like them has finally started stealing from her brother. It's one of the few treats all of my kids have consistently loved over the years (not all of them loved Ferretone). It's also one of the few treats I still give them, unless they still want to eat the peanuts from their dig box (have had a couple who happily munched them like they were buttered popcorn. Once had a ferret I found sound asleep in a now-1/3-full box of what had been a nearly full one of starch peanuts. *smh*.  Fed him - and all the rest - excellent quality food all the time. Good treats, etc. *smh* Finally had to take the dig box away for periods of time.)
Sorry, ferts - when the last of our current stash is gone, we're done with these, unless a miracle occurs and the price comes back down! *SNORT*.",0
"It's a nice lead but it's a bit springy if that make sense. It stretches, but if that doesn't bother you it's a great leash.",1
"My dog ruined this toy in less than 30 minutes after getting it. I would not recommend this toy and instead you should look into other dog toys. My dog is not a aggressive chewer but she was able to tear this apart fairly easily. And it also seemed dangerous since all of the cotton was coming out and she was trying to eat it. In my opinion, this product was a waste of money and I will NOT be repurchasing.",0
"It definitely works. Needs to be very dark though, obviously. I am trying to figure out everything its picking up - for example, you can see yellow pee on the toilet seat but also a bunch of other white spots. Im assuming that is cleaning product?",1
Didn't work on either dog,0
One of our German shepherds favorite toys from Santa this past Christmas!,1
Mozzie loves it! So I love it!,1
SO cute and so comfy. My kitties Love this!,1
"Seems to stop the barking, but rays allot of batteries.",0
Just looks like a saw blade attached to a slab of wood I coulda made this on my own had I known.,0
This product is under powered and the surface skimmer needs constant adjustment,0
I have used this 3 times kn my black poodle but it still has not covered her gray strands,0
"My rabbit ate the apple immediately, but doesn't like the wood?",0
"This is average performing cat litter with a terrible lavender odor that, through some miracle of science, multiplies the scent that you are trying to cover up in the first place.

The clumping works fine. The absorption is good. The drying doesnt work so well, because of the heavy clay-like formula. There is some dust generated.

But, wow, that fake lavender smell is awful.",0
We love it and so does the kitty,1
"Harness is made with nice materials, but fit is extremely poor. I owned the Premier Easy Walk harness for another dog before the company was bought by PetSafe. While this new reflective version is a great value, the plastic buckle and cinches are too large and fall in the wrong places. The previous version took some adjustment, but managed to work comfortably. This reflective version has excellent material and is a nice idea, plus comes with a great leash, but the large plastic parts end up rubbing against my dog's elbows or digging into her arm pits. You can see this in photos and product literature yourself. So, the original design has been reworked. It is not possible to move the snap buckles in particular. By comparison, other harnesses with similar buckles locate them higher on the dog's back and in front. Why put it so low and also near the dog's joints? It is as if the product has not been tested. Many customer reviews can't be wrong. Bottomline, if your dog has a shape that will accomodate this harness, great. Otherwise, this is no longer the best no-pull dog harness.",0
Works good,1
THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING SUCH AN AWESOME PRODUCT.  I AM A RETURN CUSTOMER AND MY DOG IS SO MUCH HEALTHIER...,1
My goldendoodle is in love with this thing. She rolls all around the house trying to get the treats out. Great toy to occupy large breed puppies.,1
My cat loves these 'fish'. She is on the smaller side and these are perfect for her to throw around and chase. I squeeze them a little to release more catnip scent and she goes 'crazy' again.,1
My 7 month old puppy had this torn apart in the first 5 minutes. :/,0
"this product is easy to clean, lots of micro bubbles and  no deterioration.  works well.  5 more words to submit review, there",1
"Love these bags, make taking my do out so much easier always have them attached to her leash. Good quality",1
As Promised,1
great,1
"My dogs love these. I have smaller, Shitzu sized dogs. If I had to do it over again, I would have gotten the smaller sized squeaker. This one is a bit big for them. But they play with them happily. It's just hard for them to make the squeaker squeak so they don't play with these as long as they do with smaller sized ones.",1
"Super easy to install and my little guinea pig loves it! She hides under it, sleeps in it, jumps/pops on it. Such a wonderful and cute addition to her home!",1
Wire coating was coming off or just not there to cover the wire. It is flimsy and the latches do not line up properly so it is very difficult to latch. Would not buy this brand again.,0
"I've only used it a few times, but for my labradoodle, it seems to works great. She is young, but pretty well behaved on a leash. My chocolate lab, on the other hand, im not sure yet how the leash would work on her. She isn't as good on a leash. It does take a bit to get used to how it detachs from the colar, but it is a good length for walking, car rides, and trips to the vet. I like my dog to be at my side when walking on a leash, so this is the perfect length for a medium to large dog. I also have a small dog, and it would be too short for him. It would be nice to have a wrist strap of sorts, because I don't think one person could walk two dogs with two of these leashes. The reel fills up your hand.  No way to put two in one hand.

Oh, and the package came a day early and in good condition, so that part is good too.",1
"I've ordered both the 6.5 inch and 9 inch.  My dog loves both and this is by far his favorite fetch toy.  He will play forever with it. The 6.5 held up for over a year, until I accidentally left it outside and he started chewing pieces off of it.  I just got the 9 inch, and it's much heavier.  It flies better since the smaller one was hard to throw in the wind.  However, the smaller one was more flexible and we could play tug'o'war with it...the big one is not conducive for pulling.",1
Easy to set up and study enough. Just have to get my dog to go inside now...,1
Our cats love this climber and it's sturdy enough that they can run up and down it without tipping. Looks good in my living room. We've had a bunch of complements on it. A real improvement over the usual ugly carpet pole.,1
"How you are supposed to use this harness is a puzzle. The instructions are contradictory. At one point you are told to adjust the harness so that the leash ring is positioned below the height of the rings on the side. This is important because the 'no pull' feature depends on the chest strap with the leash ring having enough slack to pull to either side. A picture shows a dog being led with the leash attached to the ring in this position. However, if you try this on your dog, the leash droops and she/he will constantly be stepping over it. At another point, the instructions acknowledge this issue and tell you to put on a flat collar and the harness, and clip the leash through both rings at once. Doing so will pull the harness ring up to the height of the flat collar - but, as far as I can tell, that defeats the 'no-pull' purpose of the harness. Then there is a picture showing the leash attached to the harness, but then fed up and under the flat collar, and out over the dog's back. I can't see how doing that maintains the 'no pull' purpose of the collar either.

So, flat collar or no collar? If no collar, how do you keep the leash from tangling in the dog's legs? If you need to add a flat collar, what's the use of the harness?

Despite the self-contradictory instructions, I see advantages - meriting a rating of two rather than one. (1) When the dog pulls (nothing in the design of this harness prevents pulling), he/she doesn't choke or gasp as might happen with a flat collar or slip lead. (2) The position of the leash ring does make it easier to gain your dog's attention - and that makes it easier to train him/her not to pull. (3) Ignoring the instructions regarding a flat collar, and using the harness alone, I have had some success walking our 85 lb labrador. By success I mean that the harness facilitates reinforcement based training in ways that other solutions (flat collar, slip lead) do not.",0
"I think I like these as much as the dogs! I wouldn't say they are indestructible because we have had to buy a few of them so far, but they do hold up pretty good for the amount of torture they are put through.",1
Collar completely killed over after less than two months of use.,0
"Made of pumpkin, potato starch, chicken meal with vitamins and papaya, these grooved bone shaped chews please my dogs. They come 22 in a resealable bag. They have a strong pumpkin/carrot smell. Although made in the US, customer service could only provide information on where the proteins were sourced. In this case, I was told, the chicken meal was from the US. They could provide no information about the origin of  the other ingredients except to say that they get folic acid from China. (There is no folic acid in this product.) They do seem to have fairly stringent safety protocols, but it would be nice to know where the food stuff and supplements actually come from.

I can't say that I have noticed an improvement in my dogs' breath or dental health. They are not long lasting but the dogs seem to enjoy them. The dogs haven't suffered any negative side effects and the chews haven't stained anything.  Fine as an occasional treat, they are a fun adjunct to regular dental maintenance and care.",1
My kitten loves this blanket!,1
Our miniature dachshund loves her squeaky toys. We bought this for her hoping the squeaker would survive like one has in one of her other toys. No such luck. A dog with a strong predator instincts will disable it as she did.,1

"These pet combs are great! The comb works well on all types of fur. Cat, dog, curly, straight. I love that it has 2 sizes of teeth. You can comb first using the large size, then again with the smaller size. This comb is very strong and seems like it will last a long time. Great buy for the price!",1
"Experience was great,  received within 2 days.  I have a happy dog!",1

"My elderly cat has decided she wants to lay on my kitchen table.  Ive scolded.  Ive put her in the garage.  I can not keep her off.  I read online about available deterrents.  I came upon this product.  Within an hour of arrival I placed it on my table.  30 minutes later I found her laying on it nonchalantly while my husband expressed his. know-it-all  grin and asked,How much did you pay for this?  I then flipped it over to the reflective side and waited.  She immediately returned and hopped up on the table .  Returning this",0

"I purchased because one post said they tried and could feel the warming..... well you must have to give off a lot of heat to get heat from this pad.  I tried it and I got NO heat from the pad, ended up giving it to the dog for her use.  I am a dialysis patient and it gets really cold in the chairs when sitting there for hours, I was hoping this would work to help keep me warm......  Bottom line is its not for human use ..... dog appears to enjoy.",0
"We have tried several products with our 50 pound, 12 year old Basset Hound and nothing seemed to work, but this little suit did the job.

"I never expected Amazon.com would SCAM customers just to eliminate Prime shipping on ""Arm & Hammer"" Unscented Cat Litter.  I scrolled through most pages listing this product (EverClean), and it appeared as if all of them had the ""Prime"" designation.  Also, the prices were similar to what ""Arm & Hammer"" charges.. I did not think that Amazon.com would stoop so low. Diid you get a hefty contract from EverClean?  It's my opinion that it's a lousy product, especially when dust flies up my nose and mouth and all around me, then settles on everything in the room.

I sincerely hope if only one customer reads this review, I will consider my part done!",0
It is supposed to be an excellent feed for my Cockatiels.  Only I am not sure just how much they really eat since I mix it in with the other stuff that they eat.,1

It does the job!  We scoop a lot and this works just fine for the job.  We would buy it again.,1
Great product. He cant stay off of it. Fast Shipping.,1
I received the ball in a timely manner. It is a heavy duty rubber ball. My problem is that the sound did not work after my dog had it the first day. In reality after 2 hours it was not making any noise at all. Don't waste your money.,0
dogs can actually play with this and not tear it up as easy as most dog toys,1
"I am a big Fluval fan,but this is the second of these heaters that has cracked when simply being  removed from the water. Apparently can't handle the change in air temperature,even when heater is not on.",0
Got this for my lab/shepherd mix.. very nice and well made. Perfect for her.,1
"I put it together and put it down on the ground for them to play with, and at first a few of them tried, but the holes for their paws are too small and the ball is too heavy for them to move very easily.  Now they completely ignore it.  And these are cats who will play with pretty much anything: wadded up bits of newspaper, pieces of cat chow, a sock, the cap from a bottle, anything.

But this toy is completely ignored.",0
Awesome product!,1
Great Kennel with good updates and features.,1
"My cat used to leave about half of her wet food in the dish, pushed out to the edges (of the plate or bowl) to turn into dried up cat food jerky. Since using this raised bowl, a lot less of her food goes to waste, and none of the pieces slide over the edge and get stuck to the floor.",1
This will not be used to climb mountains but will be used when taking them to the vet.  They are not  happy with this but I am.,1
"I have an older, mixed breed dog that just refuses most dry food.  Spot's Stew is the one brand that he will eat and has been eating for
some time.",1
"I give this a 2 because both of my dogs loved it.  I have a Lab and a Border Spaniel. Both large dogs and both can be aggressive chewers.  When the first bone arrived Monday afternoon they fell in love.  To the point I had to quickly order another one because of the fights over who got to chew on it.  The 2nd bone arrived on Thursday.  About 8 that night my Lab started wheezing like he couldn't catch his breath.  I checked his mouth and nothing I could see. This happened twice in about 30 minutes.  He was chewing on the new bone.  About an hour later our female threw up her breakfast in my office.  They woke me up 5 times between 11 and 7 to go outside, literally dancing at the front door.  The ONLY change in their diet has been these bones.  They are both happy healthy dogs and this whole experience is extremely out of character for both of them and upsetting to me.  The bones quickly went up out of sight.  I don't know if it was something ON the 2nd bone, as they were passing them back and forth, or if it's something in the ingredients but I'm not about to take the chance.  Bones are going in the trash.",0
Our dog likes the taste but the bag came with half of the peices broken/crumbled up. Will be buying a different brand next time.,0
My dog's favorite chew toy of all time. It lasted about a week.,1
works great keeps tank clean,1
Our squirrels went nuts (no pun intended) for these!,1
"Terrible color!  I love purple for my clothes, not my environment. Our bedroom is in blue and green...
Litter scattering, After almost 13 years, my team - a brother and a sister - can't lose the habit of ""covering up"" after use. I find the stuff all over the place, especially my bed....
And your claim about length of use is bunk! One to two weeks...",0
smaller than expected,0
We use these on our boat.  They are perfect a day on the water.  At the end of the day they clean up easy and collapse for storage.  Pups love 'em.  We love 'em.,1
"My dogs eat them right up, not sure how they work because it's winter.",1
Scam.,0
"I wish I had used this earlier. My Cane Corso chases small wildlife, including birds, and is not a big fan of small dogs that are the preferred canines here on Sanibel. Before buying this product, I was told it was cruel. As a result I tried a lot of other products all of which resulted with Luca breaking from my grip or pulling me over. One fall resulted in me requiring major knee surgery. Poor and Stupid me. This collar keeps Luca at heel and my grandmother could now walk him safely. Don't listen to the hype that this product is cruel. I love it.",1
I've had so much trouble trying to find a good size cage that is big and doesn't cost a fortune until I came across this one. I wish I would have found this sooner. This is a very spacious cage and very durable. I've seen some bad reviews about it being cheaply made and falling apart but I haven't had any issues with it. I did have to replace the wheel with a better one. Mine didn't want to work very well. Other then that I love the cage and my little robo hamster seems alot happier. I will definitely buy another next time.,1
Great harness connectors for dogs. I don't worry when my dogs want to put their heads out an open window.  They are strapped in the seatbelt. Great for sudden stopping - dogs stay safe on the back seat and pressure is only on the chest.,1
"These are fantastic.  Well made and worth the price....my cats love them, and even better, they are holding up to tons of play time from multiple cats.",1
"This was awesome at first.  My cats loved it, but the pump broke after 6 months and would not work.",0
"My cat sheds easily, and his fur gets on this collar pretty easily. It's a little hard to clean once the fur and other hair is on it, but otherwise it is a good product.",1
"Not the same color as in the picture. Sized up so it does fit but the blue is dark navy, looks almost black in dark lighting. Disappointed because our dog is all black and we wanted the shirt to stand out more.",0
My dogs won't eat it!,0
deficient we return,0
"Messy, did not slow our dog down, and I was concerned about him eating the silicone as it would not stick to the floor.",0
I have bought several bags of this litter and it was a great value. The price has more than doubled and it's no longer worth it. It's too bad because it works well and was very affordable.,0
"I have a 20-25lbs dog and this is WAY too big for him. He is a good dog and doesn't try to get out of it but, if he wanted to, he could work his head out of this collar on the lowest setting. Whatever size you think you need, go a size smaller.",0
It's perfect size for my pets. The plastic feels heavy enough that the edges won't rise. The lip helps keep the water in. The plastic is soft and flexible so I'm sure it won't crack if it gets stepped on. I would highly recommend it.,1
Very messy. Had to place a large mat under it to keep food off of the floor.,0
"My bird absolutely loves these. They are easy for her to eat. I mix them in with her regular food so she has to forage for them a bit, otherwise she would probably only eat oat groats. Good for her health. The price is decent on Amazon. I really like the bottles they come in too, which makes it easy to keep them in one place and avoid spilling anything.",1
Excellent ! My 3 dogs have allergies. Have used Blue for years.,1
"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I bought this at the supermarket for my young dog, who wound up becoming quite sick from said product, resulting in a visit to the veterinarian. A couple of weeks later, I met two other people whose dogs also became sick from this, and who also had to see their vets. I seriously recommend avoiding this product!",0
"Our dog absolutely loves this.  The faceted surface allows the ball to bounce in unpredictable directions, which the dog loves as he chases the crazy thing.  Two paws up!",1
This is entirely too thick and heavy even for my chew-crazy lab puppy. He tries to drag it around because he loves chewing it but can't carry it. Won't be his favorite long though.,0
I was disapointed by how poorly this until performed. It did not work for very long and was affected by the elements! poor construction.,0
"waste of money, it's difficult to clean and is too small. threw it away after 2 weeks of using it.",0
Dumbest thing ever. Jellyfish never sank properly.  They just float up to the top and their tentacles get hung up in the water pump. Might work pretty good if the jellyfish were neutral buoyant but they aren't.,0
Tried to order this twice and both bottles had leaked all over before they arrived. We'll try a different product with a better design.,0
My cats love this harness.  So easy to put on and yet more secure that other harnesses I've tried.,1
"Super heavy thick plastic and my cat hates it,  It sticks to carpet making it impossible to use as a chase toy.",0
So cute but doesn't stay on so not good,0
I loved these boxes but my cats don't.,0
"Very plush and colorful with true ""Chanel"" cross-patterned stitching.  Just slightly smaller than expected, but super cute nonetheless.

I will be using it for display along with a few other plush purses purchased.  All in all, very glad I made this purchase.",1
Dogs would not eat out of it or drink out of it,0
"I have an older rabbit that has been struggling a little. I started giving him joint supplements a couple of months ago. Last night he jumped up on the couch. He hasn't been able to that for about a year now. So, if you want your aging rabbit to be able to tear stuff up again, I highly recommend Oxbow Joint Supplement.",1
Only flavor of the pucksi/inserts that seems to pop out of the ball almost immediately. All the other favors take my dog an average of an hour to eat through.,0
My dog loves her Dingos,1
"This 'gentle' leader promptly tore the skin off of my 2 year old German Shepherd's nose. It is apparently, 'non-returnable for hygienic reasons' from Amazon (very un-Amazonian). Although, Amazon processed a refund as an exception avoid this product at all costs! Look for a shoulder based harness instead. This is a terrible tool for your dog and should never have been made.",0
"My 8 year old lab loves his new bed, he can sprawl out and not have any part of his 90 lb self fall off.  It is exactly as described and provides so much support.  I would sleep on this bed.  In addition, I love it because it is sleek looking and isn't an eyesore as so many of the beds we have had.  I just wish I had discovered it sooner.",1
"Smells like vanilla.  My dog has never had a nylabone so I didn't exactly know what to expect with ""nylabone flavor"".  While she doesn't exactly love it, she's gotten used to it over time. Next time I'll be looking for more of a chicken, beef, liver etc flavor to be a little more guaranteed that she'll like it.",1
"best stuff ever for scrapes, bites, hot spots, etc.",1
Not a bad price for 8lbs of bird food.  I have a parrot and a conure and they both like this food.  I used to but Eggcite bird food but it's cost has went up to the point that I can't afford it anymore.  This is a good quality bird food at a reasonable price.,1
No complaints here...great to have this 40 pound  bag delivered.i have 4 dogs and they all seem quite happy with this brand.,1
My cat's love this!!!! I mix it with their wet food and they gobble it down.  I love this product!,1
"This product is ""NOT"" heavy duty as stated.",0
"The only issue is that my german shepherd tore his to shreds after chewing for about a minute. We purchased a new one and it's still his favorite toy, we just have to take it away from him as soon as he brings it back.",1
"I have been using it about a week for our American Bull Dog (#85).  It seem sturdy enough, I just wish the handle was a little bigger.

Product update:  after only a few months the retractable feature stopped working.",0
"They are great treats but my dogs were never interested in spending time trying to get food out of something. They do play with the toy that is suggested to use with the treats, but just as a ball. There was nothing wrong with the product, just not a good choice for my dogs, and very expensive to use just as treats, which we did.",0
"The wobblerz monkey toy is well loved and enjoyed by all 3 dogs in our house.  We have 3 older med/lg herding dogs (7-13yr; 35-65lbs), all three of them have played with this toy and seem to enjoy it.  We are easily able to put dog kibble and small treats in it.  This toy does not hold a lot of food but enough to keep them interested and moving it.  The food takes me about a minute to put in from open to close.  This is not a way to feed our dogs but just something extra to keep them physically and mentally active.  The monkey seems sturdy and I expect this monkey will last a long time in our house.  I have used this toy to play tug with our Austrailian Cattle dog and Kelpie, the toy did not look any worse for wear (not really a good toy for tug but I was trying to test durability) although I expect that younger, more destructive dogs, or larger dogs would be able to rip the monkey apart (as any stuffed animal) eventually.  I highly recommend.  We may be getting another one of these for Christmas so they don't all have to share 1.",1
I'm disappointed in the antler I received.  It is very small in both length and diameter.  I'm even rather worried that my 7 month old puppy may accidently be able to swallow it whole.  I guess I expected more for the $$.  Wanted to try out Elk antlers but will go back to Newts Deer Antlers.,0
Too small!,0
"I had to return mine for a refund, it came in shattered in pieces.",0
"This was a great product for me to try, as putting my dog in the car always ends up in a bit of a hairy mess!  I have taken an old sheet before and simply cut holes into it for the seat buckles, but this is SUCH a better idea!  I love the idea that it is waterproof (fortunately, I haven't really had the opportunity to test that part though!).  This seat cover fits great in my car and I love that it has flaps that extend out to make sure everything is actually covered!  I also love that you have access to the seat belts, as well.  My kids are a little older now, but I could completely see how useful this would be under children's car seats or just under the children themselves, and wish that I had this product many years ago!  The fact that it is black works well for my dark haired dog and it keeps her hair off the tan leather seats in the car.  I would recommend this product to others.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.",1
Great product easy to fit medium size to my female Belgian Malinois.,1
I originally bought a bottle of this from the local essential oil store. My pug was itching constantly and loosing her hair because of it. She would itch until she was raw. She has been taking these for about six months and hardly ever itches. I noticed a difference in days after starting the treatment. Definitely recommend.,1
Works very well and my gold fish seemed happy.,1
Replaced lost one that we had for several seasons. This one barely lasted a month. Previously purchased items worked for a few years with battery replacements. Now the dog can easily pop the plug out (material seems to have gotten softer) and the electronics are extremely shoddy.,0
"We've been using Greenies Pill Pockets for years, but my elderly Golden Retriever who has cancer (and thus requires a lot of medication) has become picky and won't eat the normal chicken or beef Pill Pockets.  He's even learned to spit the pills out and eat the pocket.  However, the Roasted Duck and Pea Allergy Formula Pockets must be too strong for his nose to penetrate and detect the pills, for he gobbles then up regardless of their medical contents.  This has helped keep us from trying to hide his pills in cheese, cream cheese, little sandwiches, and other creations.  However, if you are hiding capsules or any decent size content, be absolutely sure to get the pockets for Capsules only. The package says ""Capsules"" (and not ""Tablets"" or ""Tablets / Capsules"". The packages come with 25 pockets each.  Although expensive, this is a great product.",1
Went together easily and the cats love it,1
My cat loves playing with this. He has so much fun.,1
got this bulb on the 12th of November and it dead on the 19th only 7 days....I've used these in the past too and their life span has never been great at all...but a week is a new low...ill be looking for other bulb brands.,0
"I searched through MANY similar products before choosing this one.  We have an arthritic 90-lb. dog and many of the other products just didn't seem sturdy enough, were too narrow, or otherwise unsuitable, but this one works perfectly.  It is not that heavy, comes completely assembled, and the neutral color blends with most any dcor.  It took some coaxing to get him to use it the first time, but now he trots right up to the bed.  Highly recommended.",1
"I was nervous these bags would be flimsy for the price. My worry was unwarranted - these bags are sturdy, easy to tear apart, and are GREAT! I still cannot believe what a great value and product they are!",1
Seems to be doing the job and cats like it so 5!,1
Great customer service and product.,1
"I didn't pay attention that this is more of a pate, but none the less my two Whiskas eaters stick their nose up at this style and yet they love the other Seafood ones.  Rarely do they leave wet food on their plate, but this does and usually some item of clothing is used to cover it over....little stinkers.",0
"i bought the bark collar for my two small dogs,whene i recieved the collar it was bigger tha n i imagened.it also was missing.the vender replyed to my reqest and sent a battery and i ryed the collar on my arm and it is to strong for a small dog. dawg gone",0
She loves them!,1
Exactly what I needed. Durable and nice colors.,1
"I was told that these collars were mean and barbaric for dogs. But my doggie is big and my hands are weak and I couldn't walk her anymore as she really pulls. This collar has been a lifesaver. It does the job. She is not in any pain, as they are not sharp prongs. She just knows that they are not comfortable if she pulls and right away stops. I can walk her now and she stays put. It's thick, good quality metal collar, good for big strong dogs. She so very well behaved with it on. If I didn't have it, she would never be walked. Thanks!!",1
"This was pretty easy to put together.  I did put a front wheel on upside down but with a screwdriver for leverage, and a flashlight, I was able to press in the side wedge and remove the wheel so I could put it on correctly.  My only criticism is that the zippers have no stop on them so it is necessary to be careful because restarting them is a bear.

Bought this for my little schnauzer.  He is still getting used to it.  Once he is used to it and gets in with little struggle then I will take him for a stroll in the house.  I am looking at a goal of 5 miles per day to my favorite coffee shop and back home!",1
"My Shih Tzu frequently gets gunky ears.. This cleanser didn't remove the waxy buildup on the inside of his ears, so I had to purchase another brand (which worked better and cost less)",0
"Bought in September 2016 and stopped working in August 2017, didn't even last a year. Description states it has a 2 year warranty-how do I do that?",0
My dog loves these.  I have to be honest since they are human grade ingredients I tried one too and they DO taste just like a Blueberry Muffin.  I love Three Dog Bakery and get most of my dogs treats from them.,1
nice,1
These are awesome.,1
works for our dogs,1
"Endless entertainment for wild and crazy wiemaraners!  The souper size is great. In two years they have never chewed it down to a dangerous level where we have to be concerned about internal parts breaking off, the thing is solid. The only downside it that it is loud and could chip the floor when dropped.",1
This listing seemed to be a price for three balls. I was extremely unhappy when 1 arrived. I would never have paid this price for one.,0
These toys are INVINCIBLE.  My dogs can ruin just about any toy a man can buy.  These things will stand up against the test of time.  And the dogs seem to like them.,1
"I bought this about a week or two ago for my dog Winnie, from the moment she got it she was in love with it. Even without any peanut butter. I have read reviews of people saying it's hard to clean, just run it under warm water and you're good to go! I don't know why but I have a chicken one, peanut butter one, and sweet potato one but her all time favorite is the mint one, I have never heard of a dog picking mint over chicken.",1
Amazing price. Same quality as ones I've been buying at the store.,1
I've used this product in the past on my dog from the store and worked well but when I bought this product on amazon it didn't do anything for my dog. The one I purchased for the store lasted a month where this product lasted maybe a week if that!!! ,0
Just got this today! Love love love it! Only down fall... I honestly believe it's over priced.. Other than that it's great!,1
My babies love it.,1
"I received a bag of Purina One salmon flavored food with a Urinary Tract Health bar code and label affixed to the bag.  My cat can't have salmon, so I donated the food to the local shelter.  I'll be buying my cat's food in person from now on.",0
"Low quality kibble, they also false advertise as NON GMO, yet, the meat animals are still fed a GMO grain diet from confined feed lots, soy, corn grain, filled with GMO. So, if you claim NON GMO, shouldnt the meat sources be fed a NON GMO diet? Nope, not the case. So much better out there, not to mention the animals they source are pumped full of antibiotics, vaccines and kept in confined feed lots. They tried to ""clean"" up their image, but it was all misleading and half truths.",0
"I let my brother's chocolate lab try out a bowl of this dog food. Ruger is a healthy young dog that doesn't have any health issues at all. When I put the bowl down in front of him, Ruger quickly took care of the food in record time. So regarding the taste, I think that's an easy 5 stars.

Then...you look at the ingredients on the bag. Chicken and fish are on there, as are tons of things that you probably shouldn't be feeding your dog. As already mentioned, three of the first six ingredients listed are soy based. That might not sound too bad at first, but then you'll notice the artificial food colors from petroleum and coal tar.

Do you REALLY want to feed this stuff to your dog now? I mean, after I saw that, I wanted to go give Ruger a huge trough full of purified water and maybe a magazine with pictures of Lassie or something.

If you can afford something better, please buy it. If you're feeding your dog cheap food, as long as it has better ingredients, stick to it and avoid this stuff.",0
This is great for keeping insects out of the dog food.  The wheels are a nice additional to move this around very easily.  Maybe a little expensive but works well for all dry pet food.,1
perfect !,1
"We just got this tank for our young son's first fish (male beta). At 3 gallons it's really only suitable for a beta and not much else. The filter tube that run up the middle takes up a lot of space in the tank and makes decorating difficult. We had to settle on a tall rock and plant combo to give our fish a place to hide since most hollow rocks or other hiding places were too wide to fit between the tank wall and filter tube. After adding our fish we quickly realized the filter wasn't going to work for him since betas don't like currents in their tanks. When running it is quiet and very gentle in the lower half of the tank, but the bubbles disrupt the surface. Our beta stayed in the lower half of the tank until we unplugged the filter...Literally within a second he was up checking out the surface. So we've now removed the filter altogether and this made the tank work perfectly for our needs. I think I could have added some nylon over the top of the filter tube to make it work, but I'd rather do more water changes and have the tank space the tube takes up than use the included filter. My son LOVES the light options and so far the LED's are working perfectly-we only have them on for a couple hours in the evening though. I gave this tank 4 stars because it makes a very nice non filtered beta tank....If the included filter were designed differently I would have given it 5 stars.",1
"I got this because it was cheap and that is what it is, cheap. It does not extend so unless my 3 year old was doing cleanup it is useless. But unfortunately his hands do not reach so he cannot use it. Very disappointed. And, it does not have a bag holder as shown nor did any bags come with it. :(",0
"My review of this was not posted.  After the receipt of this coat, we noticed an aggressively foul smell in the house.  We traced it to the jacket.  At the time of my last posting (3 days)  hanging it outside to airout had not worked.  It has now been at least a week, and things are not better.  I would NEVER put this toxic junk on an animal.  Caveat emptor!",0
"I have ordered this bed 4 times. Of those 4 times, 3 boxes were missing the screws to assemble the beds. It is beyond frustrating. They are easy to put together. One bed has already ripped. :-( I would not recommend this product because of poor packaging, the fabric isn't durable enough, and there are no replacement covers.",0
Mine must be broken because you can hardly see it light up and it stays on red for minutes at a time. Hopefully i can get a proper one because they look fun!,0
"My dog is a hard core chewer. She loves to rip things apart. She hasn't shown much interest in this item. When she does chew on it, it is a great product.",1
My cat loves these!  I put two together to make her a nice comfy bed!,1
The racheting mechanism broke after a week.,0
"My girls love this food. I've tried many other types and brands, but always come back to this.",1
Does the job to keep spilled food and water contained.,1
Cat loved it but figured out how to stop it in 4 days,0
great quality!,1
This a very cute dog toy. I wish they made it without the stuffing as my dogs have the stuffing torn out in a matter of minutes. The outer shell lasts a long time and my dogs love playing with it. I have purchased several of the Tuffy toys and love them. Hoping they will make them soon without the stuffing. :-)),1
Didn't even last a week on our dog. Strap broke easily and right in two.,0
"Tried this for an almost 4 year old dog we brought into our house.  Practically saturated an area with this spray - no go (pun intended!).  Tried it several times with the same result.  For a dog that was supposedly used to going outside, this spray did nothing to indicate to our dog where to go.",0
Feels a little too cheap and smells way to rubbery for my dog,0
"poor quality, my kids broke it on the first day.  If you are gentile it woudl be ok,.",0
"Not worth the money.  I worked for 3 days and stopped making any sound.  No way to replace battery want my money back.  We get so much cheap junk from ""Made in China"" .",0
"This item has ""Cotton"" in it's name and again in it's description.
THIS ITEM IS NOT MADE OF COTTON!
All fabric in this item is nylon.

The listing needs to be updated to reflect the proper fiber content.",0
Very good product. Better then the other cones.,1
"Ordered these and found out that the size I ordered, which should have been the correct size, was too small.  I did give them to the animal shelter in hopes that one of the smaller dogs could use them.",0
Meh. That pretty much sums it up. The hay cubes are really hard.  I'll stick to the messy loose stuff from now on. These were convenient but my bunny didn't care for it.,0
Not enough foam to go all the way around the inside seal of the door. But plenty of silicone,0
"I WAS VERY HAPPY RECEIVING MY DOG TOY,SO WAS MY LAB,BUT THE VERY SAME DAY OUR MUCH ANTICIPATED TOY ,AFTER  MY DOG'S TUG WAS TORN .....WE STILL PLAY WITH IT BUT WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED BY ITS QUALITY AND DURABILITY.",0
"My cat didn't like this one as much as the Gourmet Carnivore, but it still looked and smelled good to me!",1
"This is possibly the cutest wool doggie sweater I have ever seen. I thought it might be poorly made, but it's not. It's lovely and warm and looks really well made.",1
Appropriate name for this cat toy! Cat does act crazy and loves these so much I had to buy the 2 pack since she loses them immediately under furniture...,1
"I completely misplaced part of the filter and order this.  It works great.  I think I have a very old fresh flow because the filter is slight too high and I can't completely close the two pieces of the fresh flow, but it is hardly noticable.  The flow is great even though there isn't a control valve.  Great price.",1
This is my puppys' favorite treat.,1
"My vet recommended this supplement for my cat about 8 years ago, mainly to help with his bladder, but also because he was born with a deformed spine and ribs.  His vets were unsure if he'd make it much past the age of 5 yrs, but my boy is just a couple months from turning 10 yrs and he is still able to climb his cat tree, jump up on the countertops, and has an overall excellent quality of life.  I'm sure these capsules are part of the reason he is still doing so well.  He gets 1 capsule per day.  I open it up and sprinkle the contents on his food.  Works out perfectly.",1
My dog loves it.  He's been giving me dirty looks since I ran out. Reordering now!,1
"Product did the exact opposite of its purpose. My dogs anxiety and nerves were highly elevated after placing the awkwardly constructed wrap on him. He wouldn't even move, just sit there staring and shaking uncontrollably. I left it on him for 1-2 days to give it a chance but had enough and took it off the poor guy and instantly he started running around again. Money well wasted....",0
"This is really good quality!  I was surprised since it's just a costume, but it's a nice little shirt with embroidered wording - a LARGE is just the right size for our 17 pound Jack Russell Terrier.",1
"My ball python loves this cave. And since he lives it, he's in there a lot. And seeing as the hole where he enters is too small for my hand, being able to take the entire top half off is really convenient. I love it as well, and it looks great in my terrarium.",1
"I like it very much. It currently holds two harnesses, two leashes, and two collars for my dog. It holds them well and looks great.",1
My cat eats out of this bowl.  I don't really know what else to say.  He eats out of it well.,1
It is by far the best tic and flea collar that I have ever used.  I have just purchased my fourth one.  Fleas and tics have not been a problem while using them.,1
"In less than 3 minutes, my 20 lb. Cocker ripped  the bell out if the bone.",0
Keeps the pup off the furniture.,1
It smelled ok but my dog wouldn't lick it up.,0
Quick delivery. Great quality and held up nicely. All bells are still jingling.,1
"It does measure the bottom correctly but good luck getting the dogs foot in it!!!!!! The opening isn't wide enough and they will not pay for return shipping! Even though it's misleading!!!!! The bottom fits but how are you supposed to put your dogs paws in it, if you can't get it in the opening!!!!!",0
"This makes my dogs' hair stiff and sticky and the bug repellent quality wears off very quickly. It also has a very strong, unpleasant odor.",0
"This has to be the cutest outfit I've purchased for my dog yet!  It is ADORABLE.  I have an 8.5 lb Morkie and the small fit her perfectly.  I started out ordering a medium, but after more consideration I opted for the small and it fits great!  I contacted the seller the day after I had placed the order for the medium and asked for a small instead.  I received the small 2 days later.  Finally, a seller who actually conducts good business.  I would definitely buy from them them again.",1
Works awesome to keep the mess from splashing on the cabinet behind.  Larger than expected.  Can hold bowls for large dogs too.,1
"I have bought Silly Squeakers in the past and they were excellent. In the past 3 months, I bought two bottles and in both times, they only lasted one week.. The squeaker just fell out. I am not sure what they have done to their manufacturing process, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically.",0
Color not what I ordered.  Didn't think ordering green would come as lime green.  Picture was showing hunter green.,0
I can't really rate this product because I haven't seen a change in my puppy's skin/coat. I hope I see a change soon.,0
"Great leash -- carry it with me for our daily walk -- just in case I need to restrain my companion.  Yeah, the leash material is a little rough, but that is no issue for me.",1
Much smaller than they appear. The 3M stickies included don't really keep them together. Just moved and had to get some. Figured it was a deal at the price listed. As you can see from the photo two together are quite small. I won't be ordering these again when it's time to replace them.,0
"My dogs loved these bears. They lasted about 8 months before I decided they needed to find a new home in the trash can (they found their way outside many times through the dog door). Great for tug of war or a good game of fetch. I love that there is not much fluff inside the toy. The arms and legs of the bears eventually became exposed ropes, which was fine by me. I would highly recommend these bear toys. If your dog is a heavy chewer, they might not last too long, but then again, you probably shouldn't get your dog something that is cloth and rope.",1
too much noise..run powerfull but too much noise.,0
"This hay is a little greener than the crap hay I was getting from the store. However, my guinea pig will not eat it.",0
"I waited to write my review to see if my dog liked the mat. She does and it works great. I did buy a larger size because she likes to stretch out when she is laying down.
I only gave it 2 stars because somehow the foam or padding on the inside shifted and has bunched up on half of the mat and now we can't get it to lay flat any longer. Because of this lump she avoided the mat for weeks, but now she sort of uses it as a head rest and her back legs hang off the other end--I guess half a cooled off body is better than none.
If anyone has been able to fix the bunched up inside I would love some tips",0
Dog loved it but it made him sick every time he ate it for some reason....also it made him drink a WHOLE lot more water too  really wanted it to work out but it just didn't for our dog,0
The log doesnt fit and the whole house is off and I got a lot of broken pieces :/,0
Flashlight did not function. Unfortunately I missed the return window.,0
"AT THE MOMENT THIS IS ALL MY LARGE CALICO CAT WILL EAT WHEN IT COMES TO CANNED FOOD, HE IS FICKLE AND MAY CHANGE HIS MIND AT ANY MOMENT!",1
"Great to test if the cat wanted to use one, total garbage otherwise.",0
Very nice bed for the price.  I bought this for our 10 year old greyhound mix but my Saint Bernard has taken it over.  Will have to order another one.  You can feel the egg crate layer under the cover but beneath that is another layer of very nice sturdy foam.,1
So easy to assemble ND high quality!  Bought two !,1
It's a pee pad.....what can you say about a pee pad? Good value....good absorbancy..........I guess the scent is good because the puppy seems to like it.........................,1
"The cubes seems to be broken down a lot when I got them, I ordered the smallest package to see if my Guineas liked it. It came with 8 whole compact pieces and just more than 1/4 to 1/2 the bag was broken down hay. My guineas do not enjoy these. But I was dissapointed that the hay pellets were as broken as they were.",0
excited about updating all 4 of my pet's id tags!  They turned out great & so convenient!!,1
"I bought two of these and only got one, the package said one...my order clearly says two",0
"It's a lot of food but garbage food. Turns everything Red in the tank. My fish are pooping Red, my filter is Red and even my corals have turned Red but my fish are the same. Caution: don't be cheap, buy a better food for your fish and ignore this product.",0
"Didn't seem to make any difference in my Labs atopy. He had severe allergies and I tried everything, including cooking for him. They only thing that helped was Ventalog injections (steroid) at the vet. I knew as a nurse this left him open for lymphoma, but at least he had some quality of life while on the injections. We tried many things and the Allerderm Spot-on was one, along with Atopica (an immuno suppressant like steroids) and immunotherapy (allergy) injections but he continued to itch, scratch, loosing hair (I can't remember how many times I asked for skin scrapings hoping it was a deep seated mange); he was pulling the skin off the pads of his feet. In the end he did succomb to lymphoma after 10 months of chemo. He had no pain and tolerated the chemo great. But he was the most allergic dog I've ever had and I was wilingl to try anything to make him comfortable.",0
"This doesn't work as an automatic waterer. We tried turning the spigot down and adjusting the waterer itself, but neither worked. It either doesn't refill at all or overflows. No middle ground. Now we just have to turn the water on to fill the bowl each morning and then turn it off once it's full.",0
Received the product today and it didn't come with hardware.  Very disappointed,0
Just got these in and they look great! Very realistic looking! We got 4 sets of the 2 packs for our 55 gallon tank. They literally have only been in the tank for 15 minutes and all of our fish are checking them out and 1 of our lemon cichlids is already claiming his! :) Awesome! Love making our finned friends happy!,1
"I'm happy we picked this dog bed after researching for so long. We wanted a dog bed that would be supportive for our dog when he sat on the hardwood floor. The memory foam seems to be great quality and the bolster sides are perfect for him to lay his head on. Very impressed with the overall look and quality of the bed. The cover seems like it will last a long time. We have only had it a few days, but love it so far.",1
I have a small dog (under 10 lbs) and this is just the right size for transporting her in the car to vets and other trips.  I know she is safe and protected.  The seat belt slips right through the top handle so I know she is secure.,1
"By far the best product I've found for pulling fur from my 2 cats off quilts, blankets, even my microfiber couch!  And quite frankly, I haven't replaced the original sheet yet and it's been months - the vacuum pulls the fur right off the sheet, so no need for replacements!  Best $5 purchase in a long time!",1
"My dog seems to be allergic to poultry so we thought we would switch him to this lamb-based formula.  Usually he is a good eater, but my dog had one smell of this stuff and wouldn't come back.  I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain.",0
Cute toy but my cat tugged on it and made ALL of the treats fall...,0
"The cat tore this up in no time at all. I had expected it to be more durable, than the toys that are found in the store. Very overpriced for the quality of it.",0
Very thin and cheap.  Does not work very well-does not make a clean cut.  Do not waste your money.,0
"The ""Large"" doesn't even fit over my 60lb Boxer's head, lol. I would consider him Medium. It's  not like he's a Great Dane. These run small so order one or two sizes bigger than you think you'll need. I'll have to send this back and get a different brand because I don't trust their sizing.",0
Cat hated it. Would not even go by it. Waste of money and time.,0
Great ar first about 5 months of use and one of the springs broke. I was still able to use (kind of). Then a month later the other spring broke! Defines not buying this one again looking for one better and more durable.,0
"My cat dgaf about the pole but loves the fish to pieces, literally",1
"This might be a decent product if it actually arrived.  E-mailed the company and got a reply that it was shipped separately from another item...interesting I never received a 2nd tracking number nor did they provide me with one, seems like they just didn't ship it.....would have expected better service from a higher rated company on Amazon, but that's the digital age for ya, no accountability and excuse after excuse as to why something didn't get done.  Hope you have better luck than I did, and if it happens to you I hope you get some better customer service.",0
"I had originally rated this 5 stars and shouted from the roof tops about how much I loved this product. That was when I had only one cat who consistently has large, hard poo. I adopted a kitten three months ago and this litter box has been the bane of my existence ever since. He has somewhat soft poo so the rake gets mucked up every day and the box smells terrible. The litter clumps up and sticks to their paws and fur and they smell like old urine for an hour after they use it. I have had to take it apart and scrub it with bleach weekly and have used SIX refill trays in a month because they have gotten so disgusting (that's $80 worth of refill trays). I had some leftover Fresh Step clumping litter laying around,so I poured it in a plastic tub for them to use and it is already less stressful and time consuming. Looks like we're going back to the basic litter box.

If you have a large cat with large poo that is easy for the box to rake, I definitely suggest this. If not, this is way too much of an investment to still be such a disgusting hassle.",0
Overpriced.,0
"They don't stay suctioned to the side of the tank, at least not for me!",0
My dog loves these - and it makes giving her meds so easy. She thinks she is getting a treat!,1
"Works great! The first time on vibrate (@ setting of 40 ) our Pom went around in circles and didn't bark again for two days. Since then we have used the Beep and it also works but not for as long. We have not had to use Shock yet. Be aware they learn quickly when it is not on them and also that you are controlling it from that ""mysterious little black thing you are holding"". I whole heartedly recommend this collar. We have tried many other devices but this is the only one that works---and doesn't have to use the painful shock mode.",1
"Not a fan. I think the extra clip on this collar is supposed to be for easy-release, but it's too awkward for that. What it does, however, is limit the range of corrective motion in the collar. Not necessarily a good thing. The Sprenger brand does not have this extra clip and is better for quick corrections. Sprengers have a tendency to tarnish with frequent swims, though, so it's a trade-off.",0
"Total cost of this item is around ten dollars including shipping. This wouldn't be so bad if it did an acceptable job.  However, even on the fine toothed side, it will only pick up the largest flea, missing most of the others. Before you buy, make sure your animal only has very large ones!",0
This helped our very skittish feral kitten feel more comfortable inside the house.,1
"I applied the solution on my cat after giving him a bath and completely dried, I noticed the next couple of days that there were still fleas on him, so it didn't kill the larvae at all.  Maybe I should try Frontline instead.",0
"My cavapoo Marley is my buddy and just like my kids I like to make sure she is eating healthy.  I've heard so many horror stories about snack made out of the US harming dogs. I love that Annie's Pooch Pops are all natural and made in the USA.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach so all natural is always good for her. This box of treat is in a cute box a ""happy meal"" for dogs.  The box had doggy fries, a burger, and several cookies.  Marley loves them and I feel good about giving them to her.  If you are like me and give your pets or family's pets gift this is a really cute idea.",1
Save yourself the money and go buy a carabiner because that's the only thing I use from this purchase. I now use my cheaper carabiner when I misplace the solveit one. This harness sucks lol and I've never used it after fitting it on my pug I realized her harness with the carabiner would be much safer and more comfortable,0
Saw results within 4 days of using the product. Good stuff!,1
"Both of my cats want to lay with this, so its whoever gets to it first! I'm sorry I didn't get 2. I tried to reorder another right away, but they were sold out!",1
No fleas so no problems,0
Love it! Not nearly as loud and clunky as the plastic dispensers.,1
"I started to use this product on my Jack Russell/Boston Terrier mix about 2.5 years ago. It seemed to work pretty well. About two years ago he developed a terrible chronic skin condition that I had to use topical creams and wipes to help control, along with periodic steroid treatments.  He had large red angry looking spots all over his body. This last summer, I noticed that despite using the Advantix II my dog was loaded with fleas. I decided it was pointless to continue the flea drops if it wasn't working. About 2 - 3 weeks after stopping the treatment, the red spots disappeared, completely. Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. I can't help but wonder if the 21-55 lb range is too much pesticide for dogs on the smaller end of the scale. If the product still worked for him I would consider going to a dose recommended for smaller dogs. However, I figure it would be completely ineffective at this point in treating fleas.",0
My ferret loves it,1
"Excellent value, quality, and service!",1
My cats love this food and I don't worry because it's made in the US. It does appear to have less filler and more nutrition because my cats are eating less and pooping less since I switched them to this food. 2 paws up!,1
"I've been using this for roughly a year and half with my dogs. My first dog does not have severe arthritis, I only got it because his joints were ""popping"" he also has had surgery for a slipped disc. The popping has actually stopped and he seems to move a lot more smoothly. He also LOVES The taste, and he is an extremely picky picky dog.
I've also used it with my mother's sixteen year old American Eskimo/Jack Russell Mix and he has SEVERE arthritis. My mom was about to euthanize him because they weren't getting results with rimadyl. The dog was starting to drag his rear end, and could not really stand up or walk.  And with just being on Glyco-Flex III he's done really well, its been roughly a month, and we still have another two weeks for it to take full effect. We have also started him on Hylox over the next two days.
Overall, its been a great supplement! I'd recommend it for any dog over the age of eight or younger for larger breeds (danes, etc.).",1
Did the job and for a less expensive price than the name brand.  Would definitely purchase again.,1
Love it,1
This litter had large pieces of hard clay(?) that got caught in their paws. It was loaded with dust and was tracked all over the carpet and furniture. I would never purchase it again. I am now using Fresh Step with minor dust and tracking.,0
"Our girl was originally supposed to be my husbands sidekick when we adopted her and at the time I didn't want a dog. My husband is in the Army and his job is Field Artillery so hes of course in the field training off and on adding up to him being gone for about 5 months out of the year - not at once though. Our son was only 3 years old at the time and with my hubs being gone so often, I didn't want the added stress of a puppy. So when we found our sweet girl up for adoption at 10 months old and we knew that she was the one (it was her ears that sold us on her) I told him I would only allow a pup to join our family (especially if she was to be his mans best friend) if I got to be in charge of her collars. He agreed, unwillingly, but he agreed. Over time though our girl, Molly, eventually became my sidekick and my emotional therapy dog as I suffer from mental illnesses because like I said above my husband is gone a lot so naturally she became mommas girl as I am her main caretaker. Plus, I am her one and only bone provider. Anywho, Miss Molly absolutely loves getting new collars, especially colorful ones! Ive gotten her a plain black one with a few rhinestones on it before and her face just said, meh. So for her being my emotional therapy dog, the least I can do for her is surprise her with new collars once every 3-4 months and give her countless bones. When I received this collar, I fell in love as did Miss Molly! Its well made, has nice padding to make it more comfortable, and its super cute! The price is very reasonable as well. Molly went bananas for it and was showing it off for about 2 days after equipping her neck with her new frosting. I also love the clip buckle since Im not a fan of the buckles that slip into the little hole leaving 4 inches of collar just dangling there. Im 100% sure that I have found our forever collar crafting company and definitely cant wait to get my girl a new one in a couple of months when this one gets old and super dirty!",1
Works great and easy to use,1
"A vet recommended this litter box system to me so I gave it a try.  It took some time for our kitties to adjust but the results are amazing.  The main benefit is the total lack of odor.  No stinky urine smell.  Yay!  The kitty pee flows thru the pellets and is absorbed by the pad in the pull-out tray below.  How often the pad needs to be changed will vary based on the number of cats you have, but average for our 2 cat household is once a week.  Another benefit is that the pellets don't stick in the cat's paws so there is no telltale tracking of nasty kitty litter.

I know people who have tried every iteration of litter box that has been on the market.  None of them have lived up to the marketing hype.  This one does.  It's easy, there is NO odor and no tracking of litter.

We love our kitties, but not litter box stink and mess.  This litter box system is the answer.",1
Great and my bearded like it.,1
My dogs love these things!,1
"We have a bulldog and we have to wipe down his wrinkles every day. These wipes work great because they are not scented and do not smell obnoxious. They are gentle enough for my dog's skin in between wrinkles, but get the gunk out.",1
Made our dog vomit,0
"My pets are ""well behaved"" drinkers and eaters, so this thing works for me. I had the issue of kicking the water bowl with my feet and spilling water by doing so. When I kick it accidently now there is no spill, so it saves my hardwood floor.

The material is just fine, no plastic feel to it at all.",1
"This is one time I'm sorry I believed the good reviews.  What a colossal fail.  I have a 6 pound cat, but the area in which to do business is only about half the size of what you see, the other half is behind the divider, so he's a little cramped in there.  Bless his heart.  The divider is what separates the litter.  The top should snap onto the bottom and form a seal, but it's not a good enough seal to keep litter from literally pouring into the floor when you go to roll this thing over.  I had to buy three times more litter in the last month than I normally do, because it would leak out the seam.  Once it ever leaks the only way to get the lid back on is to take it all apart and clean out the space where the lid goes, with a toothpick.  A TOOTH PICK.  On top of that it only gets the big clumps....it does't get the smaller stuff, so I end up scooping anyway .  So....I spent way too much money on the box, it take 3x more litter, I spend probably easily 5 times more actual time fooling with it, and still end up t scooping..  So it doesn't save time, money, or aggravation.  It costs, extra time, money and aggravation.",0
"This is the second one I have gone through and both only lasted a little over a month. I've cleaned both at least once a week, but don't last very long. I will likely be looking for another solution.",0
They seemed to be old and dry.  My dog won't eat them.  She had eaten these before so must be the box that I received.,0
"Well, my bunny loves it at least. If we don't keep a steady stream of these logs handy, he would chew through everything else instead. But even these biggest ones don't last for very long before it's nothing but dust.",1
"I could get my puppy to even crate himself willingly with these treats! He loved them, the only thing I disliked was the terrible loud crunchy sound it made. It sounded as if his teeth were cracking on it. Packaging is a big wasteful, otherwise these were great. I would buy again.",1
"Resonably prices, easy installation, and very durable.",1
The add was great but the merchandise was not delivered.,0
Kind of worked. But doesn't last long,0
I'm very happy with this. The wheels actually stay on and function the way they're supposed to!,1
"Too slippery at first, so roughed up the perch.  My Amazon loved it after that and would use constantly.  But it just died after only having it six weeks.  Seems like a pretty regular problem with this product after reading other people's experience also.",0
"did not fit my2012 jeep liberty, now I""m stuck with it.",0
"I bought this for my Yorkie, and it is way to heavy to use with her.",0
They fit pretty well and seemed to be well constructed.  Seams tore at the rubber padding on the second day of my dog wearing them. The reinforcement also didn't go high enough so the neoprene got worn down as well. My friends dog had some other brand of dog boots that lasts the whole week without issues.,0
My CAG's are having a great time with this. I was actually surprised since they are sometimes afraid of new things. They took to this quickly and enjoy climbing it or just hanging on it.,1
"As others have said, it has a VERY strong smell. Otherwise, I love it. I let it air out for two days, and then brought it outside. It still smells pretty plastic-y when you get close, but I can't smell it at all in our bathroom. Fits well with our XL box.",1
"While my dogs love this treat and I love they are grain free, this is ridiculously over priced. This 5lb box is $10 at Sams Club.",0
"It was easy to assemble, and it held for about 2 minutes. The instructions said to make sure the suction cups and the window was cleaned before applying and I did, but it didn't make a difference. Best to save your money and buy a different product. Learn from my mistake.",0
My pooch loves this bed awesome value for the price easily could have been sold for more,1
Problems with excessive micro bubbles,0
"Great product, great price, fast delivery",1
Great stuff. Cats love it. Haven't had any of the kitties go outside the boxes since we've switched to this litter. I'd reccomend this to anyone with kittens.  Buy 2 and get free shipping.,1
"Yes!  These are super cute, the handle is nicely padded and the clip is very sturdy - love it!!!  Matched these with Comfort Fit Pets black harnesses for small dogs - so cute together!!",1
a little smaller than I imagined but works well,1
"I loke Kong products.  They are very durable and functional.  I leave several stuffed kongs for my retired racing Greyhound while I'm at work.  But, this one was not a hit with him.  The center hole seems too narrow to put anything enticing in it.  The slats along the outside are too narrow to clean easily.  I feel like I need to run it through the dishwasher any time he uses it.  I've tried stuffing a little peanut butter in the slats, but it made more of a mess than anything.  I'll keep trying with this, maybe cream cheese or something.  Overall, not the most requested Kong in my house.",0
"When I received the lid was cracked  Decided to repair with a bit of duct tape.  With that being said, the whole litter pan has issues.  The lid is very flimsy and continuously gets misaligned with the pan.  The pan has weird edges and corners where little can sometimes cake up (if using clumping litter) making hard to clean. I also purchas d the larger Catit litter pan that has a much better design and is more durable.",0
"Works well!  Kitty likes it.  Batteries drain a bit faster than I would have expected, but not enough to drop a star.",1
Second one that I ordered.  Seems to work good.  My cat has ear problem that continues o bleed.  I can wash one and use a clean one each day.,1
Within a week of giving my older pit these chews on a daily basis we could see the limping and stiff muscle issues he normally was plagued with were not bothering him as much. After a month he was back to running a mile a mile 4 times a week with me with no problems. It was like he was a teenager again. I will forever use them now. They must taste great as well he loves them.,1
dog loves em,1
"This ramp buckles and shifts, making metal warping noises that are very startling for a pet, which makes it totally useless for us - but this was for a potbelly pig. The ramp buckle/clip to hold it closed is messed up. Yes it is nice to have something that locks it shut, but the strap is too long which makes a gap. When you pick it up, this gap swings open (a couple of inches) and can whack you in the leg if you are not very mindful. Also, the surface is very rough - which is great for traction, but don't let it rub on your car seats or touch your clothing at all!",0
I wish these were sold with no hole for the breeds with little to no tails. I have a Boston terrier and she has no tail. The tail hole is a disservice to her and me because the menstration goes right through the hole every time. I try to raise the diaper up but it eventually scoots back down and she bleeds through it. See nasty pic - Had to be verified somehow.,0
This stuffed toy has held up better than any others I've purchased for my Border Collie.  The fins are frayed some as we play tug of war every day.  She has played with the shark for more than a month and it is still in very good shape.,1
I was expecting a bag of balls and got a bag of plastic dust instead. The balls seem to have been made out of an extremely brittle plastic judging by the pieces I got in my bag of plastic dust. The shipper sent the bag of balls in an envelope and it appears the package was processed as an envelope. When the package got to me I thought it was a letter because it was about the thickness of a letter but it made a strange jingling sound. This sound turned out to be crushed plastic and bells interfering with each other. Not a huge loss or worth the trouble to send back but not something I plan on ordering again.,0
"I was instantly disappointed to discover that it did not come in the color shown in the picture.  I specifically wanted a tan one, as I have a Golden Retriever who sheds quite a bit, and did not want a dark mat where his fur will be constantly evident.  Secondly, this was not a five minute project as advertised in the assembly instructions.  I am fairly certain, however, that it could be a high quality product if the pre-drilled holes had been drilled correctly to allow for the ease of assembly the manufacturer claims. Another problem I encountered was the mesh mat included in the box wasn't so tight that it took two people pulling on it to get the poles close enough to the support legs to be able to put the screws in.  The screws are metric, so after you've stripped the cheap wrench included for assembly, you'll need to have other arrangements when it comes to take it all apart again to wash the mat or replace it.  After forcing the whole thing together, despite the fact that the holes in the poles were misaligned (or something!!), the bed was so warped that it did not sit level on the floor.  I suppose my dog would be able to sit on it and that his weight would, in fact, force the leg down, but that's not the point.  When my husband came home and saw it teetering on the floor, he took the whole thing back apart and reassembled it.  After about 45 minutes of tediously tightening the screws one turn at a time before moving to the next, he had it together and slightly more level.  THIS IS NOT A FIVE MINUTE, EASY TO ASSEMBLE PET BED. Don't waste your money or your time shoppers!  Shop for something else.",0
"Does what it is supposed to do - keep the back seat clean!!! Good product, would buy it again!!",1
"Easy to use and relatively cheap water additive for oral hygiene of pets.  I have 3 dogs and 2 cats that share the same water bowl.  One cat boycotted the additive for two weeks and sourced water from everywhere else (toilets, sinks, cups of water, the shower).  After two weeks he gave up and uses the water bowl like normal again.",1
"Great, works as expected.",1
"Way too much maintenance required. Extremely off-putting for me. The instruction book scared me off with the amount of cleaning they recommend. I  am not willing to spend that time on a water dish.

None of my three cats were interested either.

I simply add water to the canned food and encourage water consumption in that manner.",0
I've had this for three months and I'd like to sue for false advertising. Urine that goes over the side of the litter box leaks right thorough this cheap plywood and stains the hardwood below it. It also retains the smell of cat urine. This piece of crap ruined my hardwood floor. I want a refund!!,0
"Moved and had an infestation and I have not death with fleas in decades. I tried all natural treatments for 2 weeks and still infested. After using the (Zodiac) shampoo, carpet/ upholstery powder, and furniture spray all in one fell swoop and repeating the carpet/ upholstery powder, and furniture spray 2 days later we had a cure. 2 months later still no issues.",1
Pink Color is nothing like the picture.,0
great value,1
Fine for big dogs. Not good at all for small dogs. Even though I purchased size small still too big :(,0
Dog throwing up like crazy.,0
I got this today..But it came in broken,0
Does not hold a charge.,0
"Very difficult to screw container in.  Other model we had, we only needed to set it in.  Poor design. Ultimately, I went and bought a 3 gal jwater bottle and used that instead.",0
SUPER CUTE!! But the Velcro straps were weird and didn't really fasten :/ Needless to say she wore it twice.,0
"I was excited to try this, as I have tried other Nylabone products and have had great durability. This oddball broke almost immediately, my dog was able to get two of the sides off within a few minutes. Pit tested and not approved.",0
My dog ripped all of the covering off in less than two hours of play. Not happy with the durability of this product.,0
Good,1
My 2 year old Yorkie/poodle mix can not digest this food. Atleast 6 hours after consuming this food he will vomit it back up. I have had full bloodwork and X-rays done on him and nothing. Must be this food. Do not feed your animal this food. After doing further research I have found a website containing stories of dogs who have passed away from this specific food. Please stay away from it and do research before changing your pets food.,0
Very cute and exactly as shown in the picture.,1
"I purchased one of these as a Christmas gift for my 5 cats and all that is left is disappointment! Initially it ran good and stopped every time a cat put their paw on it (my oldest male would basically sit on it.) The cats would go and sit by it telling us to turn it on because they want to play. We found the batteries go very fast, they really should have a plug in option for it! It ran for a little over a month of intermittent use (so long as we could keep batteries in it) and the motor was done.  My cats get much more enjoyment out of their other toys that do not require batteries. This  is a  poorly designed waste of money!",0
This doesn't really work all that well. I wouldn't recommend this item.,0
"I bought several nylabone products recently since one of my dogs has decided to start destroying every plush toy we own. Out of the three varieties that I got, this was by far the favorite. The only thing that concerned me was that my min. poodle mix very easily tore off chunks of the product, which I had to then snoop around the house picking up least they pose a foreign body concern!! Overall, I think this is a good chewie for supervised play. I would not feel comfortable leaving my dog to his own devices with this product.",1
Didn't even fit on the can. Enough said. Don't waste your time or money. I would look elsewhere for covers.,0
"Found that just our footsteps in the room would set it off.  If we turned the sensitivity level down so our footsteps didn't set it off, then it wasn't sensitive enough to pick up the barking.  Stopped using it all together.",0
Wow!!!  Great quality and great fit!  Love this product and will definitely order THIS BRAND in the future.,1
"came very neatly stacked and packaged, and they also came very fast. I love the sizing of them because it helps me not waste as much of the crested gecko diet I use, seeing as crested gecko's don't eat very much in the first place.",1
"Adopted a huge lab who is just like a big 14 year old ""ADD"" child. If his attention is drawn to a jogger, neighbor etc he bolts out of my unfenced yard. Initially, I was fairly pleased with this remote collar - with a few issues... they make a big deal of including a lanyard... and the opening that is supposed to ""accept"" it doesn't go thru and so the
lanyard is worthless...  a concern about the quality of their engineering.

I was very disturbed about a very rude typed statement in the box: that the unit can not be returned without accepting very unreasonable terms. I found this offensive (as well as non enforceable since it wasn't agreed to prior to purchase...) so I don't have a lot of faith in the seller and didn't bother to return it even when unhappy.. Haven't bothered to contact them about the lanyard not working or the fact that the plugs don't stay in the opening to recharge... meaning that sooner or later a water drop will land in there and destroy the collar and I will buy another brand.

The rang (distance) advertised is grossly exaggerated - assume it will be effective at a fraction of the distance they claim.

Look elsewhere... at this price you deserve a better attitude from the seller and better quality. This is a very expensive item to be so poorly designed.
It does seem to be helping to train my huge ""add child"" not to run off.... I would suggest a different brand.. there seem to be several others similarly priced - I would suggest a different seller and brand.",0
"******THIS IS NOT A CHEW TOY!**** If you are looking for a chew toy, Kong has options for that, but this is not one.  That said.  I have 2 labs.  They play hard.  They love to tug, squeak, and fetch!  Most soft toys don't hold up to them for more than a day.  This has!  It came almost a week ago, and still looks great.  My dogs knew what it was as soon as I left the mailbox.  They were so excited.  It's the same shape and idea as the original Wubba, except this one is covered in canvas type stuff, and the bottom ball squeaks.  Boy does it squeak good!",1
As advertised,1
"Expiration date October 2018. Went to open and entire container full of mold. Unopened for couple months, but stored in box in cool, dry location inside house. Assumed OK with that expiration date. Clearly not.",0
"Great quality fast shipping easy assembly.  Was easy to use.
Have had this 3.5. Months and my 2 year old pug has broken the back mesh area /window out.",0
"A Great Product & it is made in the USA
It keeps the floor dry & is very easy to clean",1
Good,1
my turtle will not eat,0
My cat has been wearing one of these for months and she hasn't frayed it by scratching. Durable and pretty :),1
Does not keep my 22lb Cockapoo supported inthe waterf,0
My Dog loved it!!! I highly recommend it for bigger dogs. He even sleeps with it and it has proven very durable (he tends to destroy every single toy he gets).,1
"Not much power, can only be used in side.  My Labrador looked at it in disappointment when I fired it outside and the ball did not even make it halfway across my small back yard.  Plus he destroyed the tennis balls that came with it in a few minutes.",0
THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS! I measured my dog to fit the size and weight requirements and this barely kept her above water causing her to panic and submerge herself. The weight of this jacket actually serves to combat it's buoyancy. I've traid adjusting and re adjusting and this product does not work.,0
Great mat. Good price.,1
"This is the first time I used Comfort Zine instead of Feliway brand and I will never use it again! My understanding was that they are the same product. Absolutely not! I have used Feliway for years with my 4 cats and it always worked. I always know when it is time to refill because some of the cats start to fight with each other and one pees in a specific place outside the box. I always clean the urine appropriately with products specifically made for this. I plugged 1n 3 Comfort Zone diffusers. Within a few days I started to find puddles of pee on a daily basis in unusual places. Every single day! I would clean carefully but the problem occurred again and again. I tried all kinds of things, placing a new litter box there, cleaning with a different agent, nothing. On day I realized the pee spots were in the vicinity of each of the diffusers. I removed all three and there is no more peeing in that area. It has been 2 weeks since I removed them and I have not had further problems. I would not recommend this product unless you want to keep cleaning pee!",0
"Cats both chewed it for a while, then walked away and totally lost interest.  I don't think they liked them.",0
"Disclosure - I did not buy my harness from Amazon - Sophie needed to try it on first.  A few weeks ago I did buy a harness from Amazon which had a clasp on the back & had to return it on receipt as the clasp could not be opened.  I took Sophie to Petsmart yesterday to try on harnesses.  Most of the so-called soft harnesses were not soft at all, quite sizable  & the back fasteners were difficult for my old fingers.  Worst, small was too small & medium was too large.  About to give up I spotted that little harness with no clasps at all.  It goes on on over the head & a slide adjusts the tension.  It is small, soft & very comfortable.  Sophie is not a big puller, but when she does pull the old collar was choking her aged neck, so a harness it is.  So far we've had good walks with this, she's worn it all day and doesn't seem to mind it a bit.  Sophie says 5 stars and so do I.
Amazon seems to have 2 brands of this type harness, both looking the same, so check them out.",1
Love love love. Wow do they stay on the dog even if she tries to get it off ! Very small though. I'll include a baby pom pic wearing one at 1lbs. And my 9lb. Chihuahua wearing two. So you can see the size difference.,1
"My dog had a bad digestive reaction to this food. I replaced it slowly as I do any new food, but when she was eating this food exclusively, she got sick on it. I had to throw it away.",0
"Amazing.  I have a long-haired cat who gets mats constantly.  No other brush even comes close to removing the hair as quickly as easily as this.  5 minutes with this brush, and I'd removed enough hair to cover a whole new cat.

One complaint: my cat doesn' like it as much as the cheap-o brushes from the store that are more akin to a human hair brush.  He thinks that style of brush is akin to a kitty back-massage tool.  This brush, not so much.",1
"My dogs enjoy this food and it keeps them regular. An employee at Petco recommended it. My dogs' coats are nice and soft, they don't shed as much, and their poop is more solid so makes clean up easier.",1
"I bought this to help my 8 yr old labrador with ccl tear get up. I never got the thing installed correctly. No good videos on how to do it. Metal hooks  for attaching harness front to back are very heavy and cumberson. Adjustments not easy to make.

 I ended out purchasing the Help-em up harness, it's well worth the extra bucks. It also has a videos on correctly measuring your dog for harness and attaching the harness. It's  a breeze to use the Help-em up harness, unlike the nightmare of trying to adjust this one.",0
"Solidly built.  Nice finish.  A little more time could have been spent cutting bars correctly.  cut a couple myself to prevent my new puppy for hurting his paws.  There were some overhangs that were slightly sharp.  No biggie, only took me 10 minutes.",1
Perfect size cage for my 6 parakeets - 5 English budgies and 1 American parakeet.  Very roomy and there's enough space for each bird to stay at when they fight.  I got it at a very low price - it was an awesome deal for the price!,1
"So this thing is pretty big for my Cavalier King Charles, but that doesn't stop her from trying to chew on it.  She loves it, I would love to find a smaller version of this.",1
It says they are chews they are hard tablets that my cat will not eat no matter how I try to disguise it.,0
good size and my cats loved it,1
This product did not work the animal was still covered with fleas a day later.,0
"Although it is pricey, it is definitely worth it. The set up was minimally difficult. I live in the Midwest, and we have also been able to use this in the snow because of the nice rubber tires.

We bought this for my 90lbs pitbull that had ACL surgery, as she couldn't walk as far as her fur-faced brother during Her recovery. We have only used it as a stroller so far, but expect to use it as a bike attachment this summer. We would recommend this product strongly!",1
"I have 2 Pitbulls that love them, they last for months! My dogs are 75 lbs and 62 lbs and they chew them nonstop. I would recommend for every dog owner who wants something made in USA & safe for your dog to chew that won't break into little pieces after hours of chewing! A+",1
"I purchased a collar in Sept and one of the prongs broke off already.  I am having to order another one quickly so our dog can be outside.  there is not time to install a new system and we have other dogs with the same collar so we don't want to change systems, and it works well when the collar works, but disappointed in the quality of this last collar purchased.  for this price, it shouldn't be breaking.",0
"Amazing!  Love this, and so convenient!",1
My dog loves rides in the car - she can see out the window and loves every minute of it.,1
It fell apart right away,0
Loved this tank until about the third week after it was set up. Wife texts me while at work that waters all over. Leave work early and get home to half the water gone. Ruined hundreds of dollars in books and also got onto a laptop. After putting the 2 fish in it into a emergency tank I had laying around we saw a large crack at the bottom of the tank. Guess I won't be buying glass fish tanks online anymore.,0
I first saw this and thought wow that would be great to use for our new puppy. We have a Boston Terrier and less than a week after we purchased it he was able to put a small hole next to where the opening is which in turn ended up being big enough for him to get out. After trying to repair it he then figured out how to now get in and push to roll it like a hamster wheel. To say the least we cannot use it anymore for him as I am worried it will not be safe. Unless you are purchasing for outside where you can stake it down I would just say be careful of using it in the house especially since my 5 lb dog was able to tip it and roll.,0
Makes my dog sick!,0
"My 5 Border Collies love it. Tried other brands, they didn't like the flavor.",1
"I'm not sure if I was doing something wrong, but even putting this product on my dog made it look like it was plugged into a 240volt outlet.

I really should have video'd it, but was worried I'd be called upon by Animal Services. This was just in my house. I thought if I took the dog for a walk, it would pay more attention to the surroundings. 10 feet into the walk, people were stopping on the street asking why I was abusing my dog.

I returned it and got a full refund. Probably just my dog as I have numerous friends that use these types of collars and they all swear by them, but my dog would have nothing to do with it. At least Amazon was really good about returning it and getting me my money back",0
The size is great. But it leaks like crazy! I can usually tighten where the threads are (my kids can't). But it also leaks out the drinking part. We refill it once or twice a day it's so bad. We only have one baby bunny. We are so disappointed!,0
"I have a 40+ lb black lab/pit mix.  I gave it to her the other day and she loved it.  I put a treat in it (looked sort of like dried fruit) that was stuck in there a while.  She enjoyed chewing, licking, and trying her darndest to get to it.  I think she's a serious chewer at 10 mos (she does some serious damage to anything that squeaks), so I'd say I like this toy and I'm glad I got it for her.  It still looks brand new.  And.. I learned that if a treat gets stuck in there, just throw it down at your patio and it will shoot out the one end.",1
not any better than using vinegar.  to expensive to not work well.,0
"My dog uses it and it makes cleanup simpler which is why I bought it. So I would recommend this product. My only complaint is that I was tapping it on the sidewalk to shake the water off after I washed it and a corner chunk of the plastic broke off. This could be a problem if it gets to full, but I have been careful not to let that happen.",1
Works well. Just as described!,1
WORKS WELL.,1
I did not like the bottom of the pen held on by little tabs of Velcro! Any small animal can get it loose and escape the pen!,0
"The answer to all my grooming needs! Gets so much hair off your pet!
Using this on my cat and dog (about the same size).. and its incredible! Purchased a second for my mom's pet!
Definitely recommend!",1
"Looks great on my blue eyed cat. He hasn't messed it up, but he's an older cat.",1
"You know... I bought this product for my parakeets. I didn't know they could eat eggs... But I figured, ""Hey! They're healthy for us, so why not for birds too?"" I like to try to give them a diet with variety. So I cooked the eggs, I even made some extra for me. I took this product out of its packaging, and ran it under water--You never know what chemicals could be on it... Anyways, I put the egg into the bowl-- and wah-la! It has the perfect mold for an egg. It fit perfectly. I anxiously went upstairs and opened my birds cage. I noticed the ridges on the end of the bowl, that allows it to attach to the inside of the cage. I was juuuust about to clip the bowl into place-- when it hit me. I didn't even realize what I was doing. I have never been so ashamed of myself. In my opinion, this product is disgusting, wrong, and against nature. Birds are meant to fly outside in the wild-- not to be in a cage. It is very wrong to keep birds away from their natural habitat. I felt like I was opening jail doors to feed an inmate their dinner. This product made me realize how selfish people can be. Please, think of the birds.",0
"I normally buy PetSmart's 'Grreat Choice' puppy pads (50 ct.) for around $15, for my older cat. Recently, when I saw these at a local Walmart Neighborhood Mkt. and they were $3 less for the same amount (50 ct.) and said they were made locally in Dallas, I thought ""Alright!""...then my cat used one. ONCE. And it leaked like a sieve (and no, claws are not the issue). I guess these other people with glowing reviews are either using the additional ""Training Pad Holder"" or their animal has a teardrop-sized bladder, cuz these things are FAR from being ""leak-proof."" I will be calling their bluff on their ""Leak-Proof Guarantee"" posted on the front of the package. I'll stick to PetSmart brand, they have NEVER leaked in the 2 years I have been using them...and seem to be of substantially better quality. Avoid OUT! Dog Training Pads with ""Moisture Lock"".",0
Too difficult to reach up and close the water outlet.,0
"Very poor construction of materials. It only lasted 1 day before the seams started coming apart in the silky lining. My 1 year old laid on it and the seams busted and the stuffing started coming out. Also it is advertised as being 4"" thick, but that is only the outer ring of stuffing. Very displeased",0
Just right for a table top.  When decorated and fish added it's so pretty.  Came with starter fluids and good directions with 2 wk and 4 wk. additives. Hood light is a little dim during the day but looks great at night.,1
"Came broken, stupidly small, slits too big, and scoop is too small",0
"I bought this comb for a Maltese and it doesn't work well at all. Although it looks nice (only reason I gave it 2 stars) it doesn't glide through the hair like some others so is pretty much useless. I do have the Safari 7 1/2"" and small 4 1/2"" and they work MUCH better ! The Safari combs run smooth through the dog coat.",0
Really good cat food.  Its just pure chicken.,1
"Scented bedding is NOT SAFE for small pets and causes respitory distress and illness, even death. Please use only unscented paper or aspen bedding do your hamster, gerbils, guinea pigs, ribbit, etc.",0
"Great dog bed and case! The fabric is a super soft microfiber, and while its very thin, its very durable. Easy to remove and wash, dry on low and it won't shrink. Replaced it once in a year and a half, because our lab eventually gnawed a little hole, but that was to be expected. The bed itself is fine because its protected by an additional waterproof layer, which is awesome! Only thing about that layer is it can make an annoying crinkly noise when he scratches and readjusts himself. But he loves this bed and its holding up great! I highly recommend it, its definitely worth the money!",1
My cats always run to me whenever they hear the crinkle of the bag. They love their Greenies. The Greenies are great for hand feeding the cats since they like them so much. They are excellent for training.,1
My dogs Love these !,1
"I was first prescribed this shampoo by my vet, due to my english bulldog having bumps along this skin from ""allergies"". After using it I have noticed the bumps going away...this is the second time I buy this shampoo (due to my pups frequent skin allergies) & it is great!
The attached photos are between a 2 week time period, and what a difference! I followed the directions on bottle and bathed my dog 2 times per week (for 2 weeks).",1
Love this type of collar. My dog can't back out of this type of collar.  I wouldn't buy any other type.,1
"Great steps for my aging boxer. She is around 65 lbs, and these stairs support her just fine. It took a few days for her to get used to them, but now she can get on our couch. They are simple to put together, and a great size for a couch. If you are wondering about height, we use them for a couch, and have another taller set for our bed, which is much higher.",1
"The Vet recommended this for my cat and he is much improved . . . we saw improvement within two weeks.
He has been taking it twice a day for two months.",1
I don't know if my cat is has super hero strength or if it just didn't meet my expectations but first day snagged and unraveled.,0
excellent,1
My cats are not interested in this at all.,0
"I use NatureVet products for my dog and have had great success with them.  These enzymes, however, smelled really bad and made my dog sick.  I had to stop using them.  I have used the NatureVet powdered form of enzymes in the past and had no difficulty with that.  I really like the NatureVet line of products, but these just did not work for my dog.",0
"Yes, not what the picture shows. Seller very nice and worked well with me to return, but did not bother to tell me they were regular xpens",0
"My bird loves it !! I have a cockatiel & he loves it.  As soon as I put it in his cage, he took a nice bath.  Love it.",1
It doesn't glow!! I wanted for my pet to play in the night and no results,0
Didn't work. Our dog wants no part of it. Doesn't collect very much hair and what it does collect is near impossible to get off the glove.,0
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT IS COMPLETELY MADE WRONG, NOTHING MATCHES UP SO YOU WILL HAVE TO ALTER IT.  IT IS NOT WORTH THE TIME TO DO SO.... I promise you will be returning it. It's junk. So disappointed .",0
nice!,1
My dog loves them but many were crushed into powder and/or extremely small pieces.  I guess I can spread it on her food but I bought them as treats not food.,0
"GREAT product, my cats love it!!
Only negative is the scent does not last very long.",1
"metal side vent was broken 1 month after receiving the crate. I'm having a problem trying to find a replacement part for the Ultra Vari Kennel 32"" 30 to 50lb crate. Also, I'm too late to exchange the product for a new one.",0
Cats throw up eating this,0
"I replaced this cartridge less that 2 months ago and it's already spent. I've always used the spectrapure madcap DI cartridge in the past and have never been let down as most lasted over a year when I had my 90 gallon tank. Now with my 24gallon tank this ""mixed Bed"" took a crap after just 2 month. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra couple bucks and get the MaxCap DI cartridge.",0
my dog loves it,1
"Having followed the directions to the letter, this product nearly killed my betta!

I added melafix to my little guy's tank to treat a mild case of fin rot just last nightl; the product smelled pleasant (a bit herby and floral- active ingredient is tea tree oil after all) but did make the surface of the water look a bit greasy.

I didn't think much of it but then when I woke this morning it was to the sight of my previously active (albeit slightly tail-tattered) and vibrant betta lying unmoving at the bottom of the aquarium. His fins were tightly clamped and I honestly believed him dead.

A little while after doing an immediate 90% water change, he has started swimming and begging for food again, but he still looks a bit sluggish and seems to need to rest often. I've never seen him like this.

Absolutely nothing has changed in his tank, other than the addition of this product. Since he was fine last night and seemingly at death's door this morning, I can only conclude that melafix is dangerous. And if it did this much damage on a largely healthy fish, I fear that using this could be a death warrant for a truly sick or injured betta.",0
"Cheaply made, does not stick to walls.  Your lizard will fall, and it's super annoying trying to re-stick the hammock only to have it fall 1 minute later...",0
"This is a cute harness for a small pet. I got a medium for my little 7 lb Shih Tzu, a pretty good fit.  I also have the white one.  Seems to be well made.",1
"We bought this food for years.  I just thought they had changed the bag design.  I did not even think that it might have something to do with the terrible diarrhea my ferts were having.  Then, I did some internet searching and found out that a lot of people were having problems with the new formula.  The minute I read that, I took their food away and ran to the nearest pet food store to buy some Orijen cat food (since there are no stores here that sell ferret food and I didn't want to wait to switch them).  The diarrhea stopped immediately when they started eating the new food.  I am so disappointed as I considered Wysong the best food for my ferts.",0
"They are supposed to be odor free, but they stink!  Company apologized and said I could return them.  I had no problem with the 12 inch sticks I purchased earlier and my puppies loved them.  Company suggested odor comes from humidity in bag and that maybe I could leave them out overnight to dry.",0
"Incredibly dull, will barely cut my cat's hair.",0
Beautiful but won't stay on my naughty cat.,1
"My large pup will play with this every now and again. Nice and heavy-weight, but my dog had ripped the two bottom legs off the bear within 10 minutes of play the first day, and had the bottom squeaker out by day two. If I keep it, I'll have to drill a second hole in the toy so as not to create a vacuum with my dog's tongue stuck in the inside hole where the squeaker used to be. I probably would not buy this again.",0
Waste of money,0
Easy to use. My little frenchie is barely fazed by  it. I also provide treats throughout the entire mani/pedi. ,1
"I ordered these because we had just gotten a new puppy and they were ""spill proof"", well that's an understatement because you can never get the water/food out! The top lip is concave underneath so when you go to pour the contents out, it just gets stuck in the edge and doesn't come out. Makes it VERY difficult to clean or simply pour out the water. I have already purchased a new set of dishes.",0
Our hamster is a heavy boy. Hence the name Poofy Moo Cow. The wheel attachment comes loose when the hamster runs in the wheel for extended periods of time. It slowly unlatches and the hamster did escape. Luckily he didn't get far and found his way into a bag of food. We are taking the cage back tomorrow and finding something safer to contain Poofy.,0
"I am delighted with your scaredy cutter for my 13 pound shitzu poodle!  I found your product by accident on amazon while I was looking for a pair of scissors.  Your product looked kind of ""cheap"" - but the price was so low that I took the chance and ordered it.  It worked great, it was quiet compared to a clipper, it was fast, and did a better job then my expensive electric trimmer.  The hair on my dog is very fair and tends to fold over making electric trimming difficult - but your product works well with his hair.  I have recommended your product to my dog owner friends.  You guys are going to make a lot of money with this product!",1
"very flimpsy. Measure ur door first! I didn't :(  Our cat wouldn't try to use it at all, it is too shaky.",0
Perfect size for gerbils! Top is a little hard to open and close.,1
"I thought I might have found my new natural Kitty Litter.  (Well, not for my personal use but for my cats  ;-)  )
We had purchased Swheat Scoop in the past and liked it but the price had gone up and it's just TOO expensive so we were happy to find this corn alternative.  Natural Kitty Litter at a reasonable price is much needed on Amazon.

We ordered 3 boxes (Add On Item) for $6.16 each.  We were VERY excited to purchase a corn based natural cat litter at a reasonable price.
Here are my main 3 reasons WHY I won't purchase it again.

Number ONE--the price has tripled from what we paid.  We actually purchased 3 boxes for the same price they are now charging for only ONE!
So, that right there would be enough reason NOT to like the new price.
2nd problem is the box.  It has NO plastic liner so it leaks profusely!  Every time you move the box a ton of litter comes out onto the floor and you never really get it all back when sweeping, so a lot gets wasted.  And really, who has the time to be continually cleaning that up?
3rd---the box says that this is NO TRACKING CAT LITTER.  That is actually FUNNY and a completely untrue statement in every way.  I vacuumed our Master Suite and then cleaned out the 2 litter boxes before we used this new corn litter.  The very next day, I saw tracking all over our travertine floors.  I was truly surprised.  We only have 2 Cats and we had never experienced this before.  I remarked to my husband that something was all over the floors.  We were very surprised that it was the new cat litter.

Consumers will put up with a LOT if they get a healthier product for their pets that is reasonably priced but those 3 strikes might just be TOO much.  I'm sorry to say--for these reasons that I DONT recommend this product.  If they line the box, work with reducing the tracking and drastically reduce the price--- then I would be more than happy to make it a regular purchase.

 If it was super cheap--yes, it might still purchase--even with the massive tracking.  I would transfer it into another bag--which is what I ended up doing, but at the new price, forget about it!",0
"I've used these for years in Miami rentals, that have musty old house smell, mild mildew, and old smoke or whatever past renters were up to. It works great and I've recommended it to several friends with pets, seems to help there, too. I'm so glad I found this product. I change mine every couple months, when the sponge is completely evaporated. No fuss.",1
"I purchased a 12 pack and found rubber band and blue plastic parts in two of the first four cans I gave to my new puppy.  The first can i thought was just an anomaly.  After researching on the Internet, seems this is a common and well-known issue with Blue Buffalo for years.  Suffice to say, I'm no longer a customer.",0
Works great on my 5 gal,1
"Not enough long bolts, not able to write on animal label, food and water would not stay hooked on door, cable ties not long enough or hand released, pet I.d. Tag useless, pad in cage useless the whole thing poor quality.",0
Doesn't seem to stay powered on. By the time my cat is interested it has just shut itself off. May need a fresh battery.,0
"This was way too small even for a 4-5 lb puppy.  I was disappointed, but I plan to order a larger size.  I had one before in the middle size and loved it.",1
I have to say I am impressed!  The quality of this harness is impressive.  I am a very picky individual but have nothing to complain about since the quality is excellent and very heavy duty.  I purchased a large in blue and it fits my 70 pound and 100 pound pitty's perfectly.  For most dogs 50 pounds and up a large is the perfect fit.  The D rings are very heavy duty and this is simply made to last.  I highly recommend purchasing this!  I will be purchasing several more for all my other dogs.,1
Nice but I would get a larger one next time,1
Ok so it doesn't work at all. My Chihuahua has marks of tears and I have been giving her the prescribed dosis every day for almost 3 weeks and NOTHING has changed. It's a clear rip-off and waste of money.,0
I've used it on my dog (short hair) and my cat (long hair). It seems to work well on both so far. Have yet to get the bunnies to sit still for it though! lol,1
"At Walmart it $9.95 for a 7oz and for as many tanks that my family has this is a great deal!!!
Will last for about a month between 3 of us. Will be ordering another soon!
Shipped in 2 days also.",1
"This is definitely not for aggressive chewers.  My dog had one of the ends off in 10 minutes.  I had high hopes for this one, it looked like it might hold up for at least a few weeks.  It was completely destroyed in 2 days.",0
My cats love tunnels and I purchased this one at Petco--very disappointed. The tunnel doesn't stay expanded so unless I shake it out it is just a flat heap on the floor.,0
Good size.  Less litter on floor near box.,1
Works ok.  Kind of light weight.  Will do for a 10-12 pound dog.,1
"These are the WORST pads EVER!!! I pick them up after my dog urinates, they are so bad, urine drippes on me and my floors are ruined. DO NOT BUY! OK they're forcing me to put a star against my better judgement",0
"I thought since the holder seemed raised, the bowls wouldn't be so deep.  I need raised for my arthritic cat, but these bowl turn out to make her bend over as much as regular dishes on the floor.  A great thought, but I need shallow dishes.",0
"Love it! Easy to use and quick for cleaning accidents. Very handy. Not expensive. Love the brand, never have had a problem with bissel.",1
My puppy figured out how to climb out within an hour. Bought the cover she was able to climb and get out. I just wanted to have her in one area until she is trained. I don't like crates but this is not a good option. I was thinking exchanging for the portable one .,0
These help our dog so much!!!!,1
VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Description mentions the superb seal and tube but ONLY the bottle was shipped!  Obviously useless without that part.  Picture(s) all show bottles w/tubes and no where is it noted that this is BOTTLE ONLY!,0
"Fast delivery and was the size advertised! My Dog loves Antlers, she is Great Dane/Pit bull mix..keeps her very busy!",1
"I wish I could speak to the actual product I am reviewing, but since I never received it, I can't say a thing about its quality, safety, or function. I also want to make it clear that I am NOT writing about this seller. I purchased a Springer directly from the company who makes it (Eaton Enterprises) on May 8th. I received a confirmation that my order was processed, and that is the last I ever heard from Eaton. I never received my Springer and despite several emails and phone calls, I have gotten NO response. It is now July 14th. I think this was plenty of time for them to get back to me. The Springer sompany gives terrible (read: no) customer service, and in fact, stole $65 from me.

If you really want to buy a Springer (which I really did want to do), definitely buy it from a third party like Little River or some other Amazon seller, as they will probably send you your product. DO NOT order it from the Springer company's website. But you should ask yourslef if you want to support a company like Eaton who steals from their suctomers and then dodges their calls and emails. Imagine dealing with them if you have a problem with your Springer. Save yourself the headache and frustration. I plan to try the Happy Dog suggested by another reviewer.",0
"Meets my and my dog's needs, and controls odor.",1
"I have found this product to be well made.  Zippers are easily accessible, and have worked very smoothly.  It appears to be designed with a lot of thought.  We use it for auto transport for a 7-pound kitty, opening only one side.  That gives her plenty of room to move around and get comfortable.  Our cat took to it right away.  She had recently undergone surgery, and seemed to find this a nice haven while recovering,so we left it fully expanded until she recovered.",1
This is awesome! I would highly recommend to anyone! It is so easy and convenient!,1
"Very easy to use and charge. VERY HIGH nighttime visibility compared to similar products. I love it, I can see my puppy perfectly at night when I let him off leash.",1
"This thing filters like a beast.  The only con is it is LOUD and needs to be cleaned and rebuilt to get it to quiet back down.  The flaw is in the 2-piece impeller design.  I don't know why Fluval did this.  Other than the noise, I am really happy with its filtering ability.

Update:  I can no longer make it quiet. I have tried rebuilding it multiple times, and tried every tip that I could find on the internet. This thing is terrible. It's loud enough to Wake the Dead. I'm going to contact the manufacturer to see if there's anything they can do.",0
Didn't slow my dog's eating down at all and the rubber ring on bottom does not stay on very well. I will say however the color is nice and the construction of the bowl itself is good,0
"This is a good little catnip toy. There is only one thing wrong with it, and that is that the catnip isn't super easy to put into it.",1
Works wonderfully,1
cover came off within a day,0
This is a great doggy door until the plastic around the edges gets brittle and cracks. Once it cracks it falls off and doesn't seal the door completely and lets in the air & bugs! When it's windy the door stays open because the plastic won't form a seal! Unfortunately we have the patio door insert and have to keep replacing flaps! This is the 3rd one in 4 years!! Make sure if you purchase this it's not installed in the sun or the windy side of your house!,0
My PUG LOVES this Kong toy. He just goes crazy over it. I have actually purchased a few of these over the years.,1
this is a very small net and I was expecting a much larger size. the net can only be used for getting debris out of the tank or for very slow fish.,0
came broken until i get a new one one star im upset ,0
Great product,1
Plants arrived green and heathy without any sign of wilting or rot. Quality product.,1
My cats love this! It was easy to put together. It has high levels for them to climb to and then lay down on. It has room for them to play with each other if they're on different levels. My kitten likes the higher cubby hole to lay in. Its sturdy enough for my 13 lb cat which was important for me while looking for a cat tree. Be careful not to rotate the perches up high once they're screwed in because they come loose and your cat can spin off and fall. Also supervise them when they're playing with the dangling mouse because they can fall while trying to get it. We put it close to a higher piece of furniture and my cat decided to jump to it and it was scary so we have to make sure he doesnt plan on doing that again if he gets up high.,1
"My JRT lunged at something outside the car and ripped the skimpy securing straps right out of the seat. He still loves to ride in the seat but as he is propped up, I would prefer to have him secured in the seat. I find the  process of securing the booster into the car's seat quite cumbersome. He is my co pilot so this poses a problem when I have to move the seat because a human is riding with me. I also feel like I need to wrap an xlong bungee encompassing the seat back and the entire booster for the booster to be well secured.",0
Way too flimsy,0
Product measurements were wrong.,0
Poor quality. I sent it back.,0
"I bought this for our eldest cat, who developed periuria two years ago (pees on my spot on the couch when he is mad at me) and who is now attacking the second eldest cat randomly. He has had a complete work-up by my vet and the feline specialist at a university hospital ($1400 worth of tests) and has nothing wrong with him except for arthritis and a grouchy disposition. We tried Comfort Zone Feliway diffusers, more litter boxes, scooping the littler more often, and he is getting Glucosamine injections every three weeks for the arthritis. Nothing worked for the aggression or periuria, so I tried this product.

This is a purple collar that comes in a sealed bag. When you open it, it has a lot of white powder on it, that smells a little like lavender (it is pleasant at first, but after awhile may be annoying). A lot of the white powder will come off as you handle the collar, but this should not concern you according to the box, as some of the pheromone has permeated into the collar. It has some deep grooves/perforations at one end, that make it a breakaway collar - if you pull the collar will tear apart. I read the other reviews where people said it would not break-away; I don't know if those are older versions, but the box I bought specifically said it was a breakaway collar, and it is - I tested it myself at the end of the month. It is slightly difficult to adjust to the right size, but not terribly so. It lasts about a month if worn continuously. If you only use it intermittently, you need to put it in a sealed Zip-loc bag during intervals, so it will last longer.

This product did nothing to help my cat. In fact, he went and pee'ed on the couch a few minutes after I put it on him. - he didn't like the experience of having a collar put on and taken off several times in a row to get the size right.  Otherwise, it did not change his behavior for the better or worse.

It did occur to me to try spraying Comfort Zone Feliway spray daily on a regular breakaway collar, instead. We will see if that works...",0
The dog hated it.,0
"I would like to return it as my dog is covered with fleas and I found a fully engorged deer tick in his ear that had obviously been there for at least two days so now we are hoping that he does not end up with Lyme disease.
I bought a second one for my sister in laws dog and he is covered with fleas as well.
So I feel that I should be refunded my money that I paid for both of these products.
I have been happy with everything else that I have purchased through Amazon but I will probably never order any Seresto product again.",0
"My dog seemed to like these at first but then started turning away from them at times, telling me that he wasn't crazy about them. For a ""training treat"" I want something that's more appealing to my dog.",0
My male cat got his urine blocked by crystals. The first thing my vet asked me was what was i feeding him. Stay away from their dry foods at all cost. Usuaslly people buy it cause its really cheap. But guess what i payed 700 bucks to get my cat well again . Their wet food is ok but the dry is really bad for them. I started him on cat chow blue bag and he never had a problem again. I do mix water with the dry and he likes it. He gets his water needs before he eats the the dry food.,0
"I'm sure this bench had good intentions, but when it arrived it was incredibly small! My cat doesn't even fit on it, nor does he use it because its made of cardboard.. u can't even tap it because it'll flip over.. there's no way an adult cat could use this as a scratcher unless its anchored to something somehow.. this bench is better suited for kittens i think.",0
My goldfish love it!,1
"very good quality, but did not try them yet.....",1
"This bark collar works very well.  Directions were a little unclear though.  1) do not keep your dog's tags on - they jingle and can set off the collar without them even barking.  2) My dog always has a harness on - I read in one spot not to use the bark collar with a harness and in another spot that it was ok to use a harness. Using the harness works fine as long as it doesn't get in the way of the bark collar.

My dog learned very quickly. If she starts barking in the house, we put the collar on and she instantly calms down without even another peep from her. (she has learned that she can still get our attention with a little 'dry bark' but that's much better than the annoying bark saying "" I want to play"" at 10pm.",1
Lats two cases my cats wouldn't hardly bite.  Must have been a bad batch.,0
"Used this on some very stiff stirrup leathers and it helped soften them. It darkened the leathers a bit, but I expected that.",1
"I bought these from my local grocery store. Crunchy chicken and turkey. My cat loves these and comes when the bag is shaken.

This also makes check ups and nail trims much more bearable once you get your cat trained to these. I had my cat spayed recently and she normally hates me checking how the healing process is going. After a few check ups now she doesn't mind knowing she'll be rewarded with a treat afterwards.",1
Bottle arrived cracked leaving calcion in the envelope. Leaked all over the bottle and the crack is at the very bottom.,0
Works well.,1
Great product works great.,1
Lid is nearly impossible to put back on the bottom!  Very Cheap. Plan to return it,0
"Had not tried any freeze dried liver with my dog before, and having read about it thought I would give it a try in his training.

First, the chunks are so big (long, wide and thick!), that you need to break them into tiny bits yourself. Some of the chunks are super hard to break with your fingers, which if you need it quickly is no good.

I was also disappointed in my dogs response to them. I thought he would go crazy for them, but didn't get any more enthusiasm than I do when I use his kibble. He much prefers freeze dried turkey.",0
"Great product...I use it every day with my Dog, Carlee...have given at least 10 of them to different Dog owners...these are not at the name brand pet stores that I could find",1
"Not a review writer, but absolutely soooo impressed and in love with this dog tag. Bling tags in petsmart cost $20!!!!!!! And they aren't even close to as cute and sparkly. Super impressed and will order again when we move in a year. Great price.",1
Cant beat the price! Pleasantly surprised of the quality for such a low price. It was easy to put together (took me maybe 15min). My kitten loves it!,1
"My cat loves these and nutritionally they're better than many treats.

HOWEVER.  They decided with my most recent order to get rid of the lid with the flip top corner for dispensing, and now you have to remove the entire cover.

While this probably saved them 5c, I won't buy them anymore.  Too much hassle to take the whole lid off and put it back on, and the lid probably won't stay in one piece with all of that bending.",0
Way too small a waste of money,0
Everyone needs to understand these are NOT 30oz bowls. They are 30oz mislabeled and actually 20oz. It just so happens I need this size as well so I am going to keep them. Not happy about the price though. Amazon if you read this you need to look at what you are selling in these.,0
"My boyfriend and I each ordered one of these. I use it for my crested gecko, and he uses it for his bearded dragon. They both give accurate readings and can withstand a variety of temperatures and humidity ranges. My gecko lives in a humid environment that's typically 70-80F, while my boyfriend's bearded dragon lives in a dry, hot environment. This product accurately reads the temp and humidity, which allows us to better care for our pets. I'd recommend this to anyone with a reptile!

It works better than your standard plastic Frisbee but she can still destroy one in a about 2 hours. She usually chews a hole through the center and then wears it around her head like a Halo. She is my little devil doggie.,1
"I cannot sing enough praises for this dog food. My dogs love it and they stay healthy on it. I have tried many brands and flavors and this one just seems to be perfect in everyway. It's also a five star rated food and thats a must with me, Highly recommend.",1

terrible material I have a basset hound and he chewed thru the front and got out. so now I face the front of carrier towards the wall since the door doesnt work anymore.,0

"I did not like the fact that that I did not receive all the colors advertised. There wasn't a green shirt, instead I received 2 orange shirts, 1 red and 1 blue shirt. Very disappointed.",0
"The size small that I received is too big on my dog. I measured him and ordered accrdingly to the size chart. It keeps slipping off of him. I used my Amazon prime 2 day shipping to receive it fast because my dog keeps having accidents. It came right on time. The item seems to be very well made and cute, but it has become a hassle of keeping it on my Chihuahua since he can wiggle his way out of it.
 * If the seller can send me an XS, that will fit my furr baby correcrly, I would be willing to revise my review. *",0
We used to buy Vermont Chew man products for our black Lab and they lasted well.  Not this one.  the puggle destroyed it within a day.,0
"Let me be clear, I love the product, but I have had too many severely dented cans over the years, so this is the end of the line for me.  No more canned pet food shipped direct from Amazon.  And the dented cans are always in the MIDDLE of the case, so you don't see them right away.  Never again.",0
These rocks are tiny. Not usable by any cichlids over 3 inches... I feel ripped off!,0

"I did all the research, got a 5 gallon tank with filter (adj. to low current), and a heater. I did weekly 25% water changes. Every betta I got died of swim bladder. I was advised by aquarium shop to get this tank and just added a small heater (sold by hagan) and presto!  No more sick and dying fish!  I do weekly nearly full water changes and he is still happy, active and alive after over six months!  I like to add a pinch of aquarium salt when I add the water conditioner and a wee bit of stresszyme. He has a plant and a betta hammock and the big bubble nest he frequently makes for decoration. If my fish is happy I'm happy. I made my 5 gallon into a guppy tank. Despite other reviews I have proof that works for me...no more dead bettas.",1
I actually would have loved this but for smaller dogs it does not always fit correctly (especially the back legs part). My dogs back legs would not stay in this.  Would be Perfect for cold weather.  Returning this was a hassle and required many emails.  I was afraid to size down because I did not want to have to go through another return process. This is not something you want to purchase online as your dog may not fit and their customer service can be a hassle.,0
"Not very impressed - it's very noisy which is distracting for the cats. It's not very engaging for them. The laser is nice, but I think the design is a little lacking and cumbersome. Its just too loud and ostentatious.",0
Used as directed and my dog became very ill...ugh.  Won't use it again.,0
"I have a small dog of 15 lbs. One day while walking her the collar just pulled open where it connects. Luckily my puppy came to me but this could have turned out much worse. If I pull at the openings, it opens every time. Do not trust this collar. I expected more from the Kong name.",0
It's ok. It did it's job but started to come apart a month after I installed it. I guess that's why it's not $100,0

"I have a 12 year old pit who has suffered from manic incessant air licking (not as a result of seizure) that would last for hours. His bottom lip was raw and no medication helped. He recently started getting up and pacing at all hours of the night, urinating in the house, and staring into space, seeming to be lost. A combined regimen of Sam-e, omega bites, and melatonin has significantly reduced the licking, eliminated the peeing in the house and staring into space, and had no effect on the night pacing. Its a huge improvement and Im thrilled were all getting some relief.",1
I been ordering this for years but this time it's not the same. It's thinner and lighter but looks same till you feel it almost feels like a cheap knock off.,0
"Love the filter feature, since we live in Arizona and the water is very hard here. The last bowl I had ended up with a calcium deposit ring in the bowl that looked rather unpleasant. I also upgraded from a 1 gallon to 4 gallons since I now own 2 dogs. I only have to fill this once every week or so. Only thing is, being 4 gallons it is HUGE and very hard to get the full jug from the sink back onto its base, its so heavy! So i only fill it 80% of the way to make it easier on myself.",1
"It took me awhile to review this product. Fore  my dogs are potty trained  and i wanted to include that also.  I am allways happy to recieve a discounted item to review! However  few are this good regarding pet smells.  It worked on my nieghbors puppy spots  And yes the puppy as far as we watched did not return to that spot again.  WE then took it upon ourselfs to spray the whole rug even though it didn't need,  and  the puppy then went on the kitchen floor over night and not the rug.  It actually is helping with the potty training. In conclusion Barker & Pooch's Stain and Odor Eliminator is super effective and you can feel great about using it because it is safe for the environment and the entire family including your four-legged members.",1
"Good product. Needs a few safety pins in places to keep from sliding down, but otherwise a great investment. I wish I would've found this product earlier. I would recommend this to others.",1

Works for our dog!,1
"All four kitties LOVE these Temptations treats.  Even if someone is feeling a little punky and doesn't want to eat their regular food, they ALWAYS take some Temptations treats.",1
awesome,1
Do not buy! I have bought different more expensive brands in the past and never had any problems with them. I decided to try this brand out since they were so much cheaper. However I put 2 caps on our cat and my husband got some of the glue on his finger and it made a chemical burn on his finger he said it hurt pretty badly. Our cat was crying very loudly in pain and I was wondering why until we figured out that the glue was burning her also because it's not a thick liquid it runs out of the caps and into their fur and skin around their pad. The other more expensive brands have a glue that is much thicker and dries VERY quickly and doesn't run out. Also when comes in contact with your skin it doesn't burn. My recommendation is to spend the extra money and buy the better name brand caps. I go for soft claws brand.,0
Catahoula puppy put a hole in it in under 6 hours.  I needed something to keep her occupied and this certainly did it but i can't afford to keep buying these.  :-(,0

I was shocked when these came to the house.  The pouches were small and only 4ozs.  You can buy the same treats from Wal-Mart for the same price and it is an 8ozs. packet.  You actually get more of the treats in the package.  The package is double the ounces but their were more than double the treats.,0
Junk Plastic Buckle. Broke on a 70 lb German Shepherd Puppy. What a Joke. Do yourself a favor and def don't buy this. It is complete Crap.,0

I've been giving this to my 90lb doberman for the past few months and his coat has never been shinier and soft. I highly recommend this product if your dog has flaky or rugged hair and skin.,1
"Great product! My cat does not like the regular brushes, and he tends run away from them. With this glove, he lies down on the floor for me to pet him. I like the size too. Not too big, not too small.  I have small hands and the adjustable wrist Velcro helps keeping the glove in place.",1
I love this bowl. It looks very nice and is a great size for my 100 pound boxer mix. He is slim and tall and this adds the height to help avoid bloat I like that the legs fold in just in case I need it closer to the ground.,1

Work very well. I  like that they last a long time,1
We have purchased this litter box two times now. We thought when the first one quit after six months it was just a Gluck. We purchased a second one. The same thing happened. The conveyor quit working. They want me to buy a motor for $14.95 plus shipping. The parts should be replaces for free the litter system was less then 6 months old. I don't think I will buy a third.,0

Impossible to clean as the poopies hide in the pellets and 1 only a small 6lb cat so her small poopies are hard to find.  Next the smell.  Urine desolved the pellets.  Following directions of filling box 3 ""s or so.  I need to change entire litter box every couple of days to get rid of smell.  Will not recommend or buy again.",0
These vary too much in size with most being too small. Good for a toy variety dog I suppose. Blah.,0
I got these for my dogs for Christmas. I had no idea they would love them this much! They chewed them fake hours!,1
"This raincoat, size small, was listed as for an 8-12 inch dog (base of neck to rump). My dog is around 14 inches and this coat was huge on him. They will take a return, but charge $5 (you pay the return shipping, and they dock you $5 for the shipping you got free on the way out). Since the item was only $9.42, it makes no sense to pay to ship it back and then be docked another $5--that's right around the cost of the coat. So make sure you get the right size the 1st time.

The coat itself is cute, easy to get on the dog and a decent value if you can get the right size.",0

And then the fencing was all tangled up,  it took forever to untangle it.  I would not order this again.  And I couldn't return it because I couldn't get the fencing back in the box.  I wanted something I could walk right into thinking it was 5 feet tall when it's only 4 feet tall.  Disappointed.",0

Ordered a small for my 20 pound Boston Terrier for our night walks. I would order down a size. My boston has a huge chest so I figured she'd need a bigger size but this one is way too big.

My vet opted to having me feed Marley a food completely different from this. So, I can't recommend this puppy formula food.",0

"Disappointed. I love this idea and jumped to order the embroidered collar.  The collar is too large for a cat. In order to get it tight enough around her neck so she couldn't get her jaw caught in the collar, I had to cover up the name and phone number. Even then, there was so much overlap in the collar that she was still able to stick her paw in between the folds of the collar and pull it off. I would not recommend this product for a cat.",0
"I had very little confidence in this product when we purchased it, however, we have a 12 pound  black and tan Chihuahua whom we love dearly eventhogh she has always had a strong 'doggie' smell just a day or so after a good bath. So, we tried this and upon reciept of it, we bathed her and then gave her no other water except  that with this Pet Beverage in it as directed.

She normally had to have one or two baths per week in order to tolerate her in the house. But, it has been almost a month and she still has no bad odor whatsoever. Of course, we don't indtend to stop bathing her but we are kindly testing this stuff and so far, it is amazing. Also, I thought the price was rather expensive, but I ordered 2 one-liter bottles and so far have only used half of one bottle. So it goes farther than one would expect. It is well worth the price.",1
My 9 month old puppy had this torn up within seconds.,0
This is the best scoop around.  Arrived on time and as expected.,1
Love it! Wish a came with a cord though. It works wonderfully with our other one. Our dog can now go further and have room to play!,1
"The Breeze is a much cheaper investment than similar items like he Littermaid and ScoopFree. My cat has never been a finicky litter user (I've switched 5 times on the poor little guy)so transition was not a problem here. I find the odor control using Feline Pine than the provided pellets is much better. I have stuck with the Breeze pads however, they are very absorbent and my Johnny is a serious pee-er.

The best thing about the tray below is the fact you can rotate the whole thing without touching the pad. This is very useful as our cat pees in the exact same spot all the time (a major reason for switching from traditional litter in the first place). I do have a single cat however and given the use here I would imaging more systems would be useful for multiple cat homes.

There is some spillage of the pellets, but that is way easier to sweep up than traditional litter! I've mixed some baking soda with the pellets and poured some on the pad with good results and keep an air freshener in the room. All in all, this definitely beats handling traditional litter for me!",1
Was told it would work. It didn't.  Bad seller,0
Only used it twice so far but seems to be excellent...cat seems happy,1
The ball did not giggle.,0
It is so cute but all the tags a small but it's more like an extra extra small. if they send me a return label and the next one is the right size I will change my review. otherwise just know they run very small.,0
This product saves me a ton of money of vet visits for my golden retriever. I use it as needed - as soon as my dog starts flopping his head and his ears look a little dirty.,1
"It seems to work good HOWEVER the collars are horrible. My Dog got it off 4 times, the last time was off somewhere out of range and we can't find it. Trying to figure out new collars to buy. Won't put the other dogs on until I find new collars. Not sure if I can buy a replacement for the 1 dog???",0
My ferrets love these. They are a healthier option for treats and are good for their teeth.,1
"Great price, does the job",1
"these are our everyday walk-the-dogs bag and a staple. Nice tight little package fits neatly and easily into pockets, pouch, or backpack. Must say, having big (clumsy) fingers, opening the bags for pickup can sometimes be frustrating & tricky, but eventually you learn it....to a degree, 4 stars for convenience - would be five if there was a 'tab' to assist opening.",1
Elliot the Cat thinks it is perfect.  Sorry couldn't resist.  He is about 18 pounds and as you can see fills the bag.  He loves it though.  In fact he won't come out.  I would not recommend this for a pet that is any taller than a yorkie though as my rat terriers are too tall for it.,1
All the cats love this!,1
"Okay. Yes the stuffing shifts. It is like an under-filled bean bag.  It is noisy when my dog moves on it. All that is true.
My dog is 175 lbs. No matter what he does, he is noisy. If you have a dog this big, you are accustomed to noise. The farting, the licking, the drool...oh my gosh the drool. Which brings me to the waterproof (noisy) material. Bonus! I don't have to wash his bedding. I just wipe it off, that is if he hasn't rolled over and wiped it up with his own fur. Dirt just sits on top, so I shake it off outside.
I have 2 inside dogs and 2 inside cats. Every animal in the house loves this bed. I have even had a teenager join the dog while watching TV. To me, I don't think it looks all that comfortable but my dog hasn't slept anywhere else since we purchased this (unless a kitten took it over, in which case he pouts until we move the kitten).
Bottom line, my dog loves it. It's his and he knows it. He is 8 years old and he has ruined many a couch. This is keeping him off my down filled couch? Yes, I'll keep it.",1
"great product could not believe how fast it got here, just as i needed with 2 puppies,. loving it, thai you indeed",1
They smell really bad and not enough enclosed for the money,0
Just started using these. Think they will be good in traveling cages.,1
Used on my 50lb black Labrador puppy twice. It ripped at the leash clip during the second walk. The light worked well. Please improve,0
It did not work at all for my dog :( it did work for my sisters dog and she was the one that recommended it me so I gave it to her.,0
"I have a 65lb, 5mo old chocolate lab puppy who can unbuckle himself while wearing this seatbelt harness. He is buckled in, hooked to both the lap & shoulder belts, but he has figured out how to unbuckle the seatbelt & from there, the hook just slides right off... Sigh...",0
The Gentle Leader head collar is a great tool for controlling large dogs who like to pull.  I like the color options.,1
useless. does not work at all,0
my god loves this.,1
"Good, a tad heavy.",1
my cat not a fan,0
This did not fit that well on my 04 GTOs front passenger seat. Also the middle strap ripped off when I tried tightening it on the second day but decided to re-sew it myself,0
"I am happy with the ingredients in this grain free formula. All 3 dogs I feed it to really loved the taste. However, one of the dogs had diarrhea all over the house during the night.  This is why I removed a star. The other dogs had no stomach issues with it.",1
"Purchased for my labs who inhale a cup of dry food in under a minute from their puzzle-bowls. They love picking their lunch snack out of these - one dog throws his, the other likes to rock hers and tip the food out the side.  Dishwasher safe and it mixes things up for them each afternoon (as opposed to dining from the bowl).  I'd buy it again if anything happened to the ones I have.",1
This is the best kitty litter I have ever used!!!!! My cats litter box is in the living room and no one can ever tell that I have a cat. I am very displeased that I selected prime shipping for this and still have yet to receive it in three weeks later,1
The roof was damaged. Box was damaged. Must have shipped from China via bicycle. I will fix because it's to much trouble to return. Not a happy consumer.,0
Dog adores them and I'm hoping to save on vet dental bills.,1
"Keeps my dog from getting poison ivy (for the most part) but the velcro comes apart easily when he's running through the woods. His leg has gotten caught up in it a time or two due to this velcro problem. It is also a bit long for his short torso. if it were 1/2in-1in shorter it wouldn't rub on his back leg pits as bad. all in all though, it does what I bought it to do-keep poison ivy off his belly.",1
Looks like a cat collar. Poor  quality. Could literally not even see it on my big dog. Sorry but its worth about 2.00 not 20 some. I sent it back.,0
"Great odor destroyer!  We have a dog and three cats, so odors can be a challenge.  Tried a lot of products,  but very happy with the performance of Pure Ayre. We don't like toxic products, so are happy that we can safely use it directly on the dog (as indicated on the bottle) in betwen baths, and on his bedding in between washings.  Really makes a difference.  Love it!",1
"Don't waste your money. Sizing is off. Ray Allen.com will not stand behind their product. Inquired about getting an extra piece of strap so it would fit my dog and they would only sell me an additional buckle. For a $90 vest, I would expect better service. Going a different route. What a shame.",0
This product works way above my expectations!  My nervous cat Jackie is so much calmer when I use this product than when I don't.,1
Great brushes,1
Easy to put together and the cats love it!,1
Works well.,1
It is not certified organic when it is put into a bag. It has to come from the farm alone in a truck or with all other organic material. It cannot be shipped with any other products as it loses its  Certificate,0
Timer is crazy and inconsistant,0
"When we first used in on our 1 yo yapping Bichon, he seemed to look around to see what it was.  That lasted about a day.  After that, no matter if we were pushing the manual button close to him, he didn't bat an eye. We have no idea if it was working.  I would have returned it but - of course - we lost the receipt.",0
My cat loved this at first and enjoys it even more when I sprinkle catnip on/in it. She'll occasionally scratch the floor part of it like it's a scratcher and she sometimes lays on top of it for awhile but she doesn't use it enough to justify saying I love it in my opinion.,1
Too small,0
Doesn't work very well. My puppy not that startled. Really don't use it.,0
"Our family avoids GMOs like the plague and that includes what I feed our beloved Golden. Had I realized that these contained corn syrup AND sugar, both containing GMOs, I never would have purchased them. Had I known they were not made in the USA, I would not have purchased them.  The one time I neglect to read the negative reviews it turns out I really should have.  Corn syrup? Sugar? Lead? Synthetic ingredients? GMOs? Stay away!!!",0
"This nail clipper is so much easier to use than the one we had before, the guard is nice because it stops you from accidentally cutting too much of your dog's nail. Highly recommend!",1
CLUMSY.,0
Good price and Article doing his description. Fast shipping.,1
"I bought the freeze dried minnows and none of my 4 cats will eat them. They were all interested in the package and wanted to sniff them. 2 licked them once and walked away, 1 didn't go further than sniffing it, and the other put it in her mouth, just to spit it out immediately.

I've never purchased anything for my cats that none of them liked. Very disappointed.",0
Just what we needed for Colorado rain and snow!,1
My cat didn't originally like this lounge and took time to persuade her with some catnip. Now she uses it when I'm not home as if she doesn't want me to know she likes it!,1
I like these bags because of their size.  I have two mastiffs and the bags do a great job.  The bags are wider than other bags and it has made pick up so much easier.  I highly recommend for larger dogs.,1
The only thing I would add to this product is a 1/2 inch opening wire mesh floor above the slide out tray.  Would make for longer lasting bedding and easier clean-up.,1
Due to NO packaging I lost 3 cans from dents so severe it opened the cans,0
"I purchased smaller heated houses that my cats began to use after a couple of cold nights. When I introduced this larger one, my 18-year old female took it over immediately. She even uses it during warm afternoons. This is a great product!",1
Everything we expected,1
"We used this product designed for kittens (8 - 10 weeks old) and under 5 lbs.  The product worked; however, it also burned the skin of one of the kittens which resulted in the loss of fur around the application area.  It scabbed over and will more than likely scar.  Due to the results of this product on one kitten, I will NOT use this product again.  The other two kittens received the same amount of application and were okay.  Nevertheless, I'll look for an alternative method other than this product.",0
"Bought these for my Pomeranian and she loves them! I wanted something that squeaked, was light weight, and came in a package of more than one.. and this was EXACTLY what I was looking for! There are 3 squeakers in each toy (one in the head, one in the middle, and one in the tail). Also since she now has three, she doesn't just focus on one to rip apart. They're actually lasting longer than her other soft toys. These are a great buy with a great price. I would highly recommend! (For small dog owners)

"According to Super Pet, the wood they use is oak and fir. WHICH ARE BOTH TOXIC TO CHINCHILLAS. DO NOT BUY.",0
"My English Bulldog has several allergy issues, like most Bulldogs, including dietary.  He has been on this food for over a year.  He loves the taste but would probably eat anything I gave him.  Since starting him on this food his dietary issues have been at bay.  High quality ingredients.  I give my Rottweiler another food from this brand that she also loves.  She does not have dietary issues but I figure if the quality is good enough for the Bulldog then I may as well have the Rotty on it too.",1
Perfect,1
Runs very small! But oh so adorable! And good quality!,0
My dogs like it!!,1
it seems to be feeding the cat double amounts at each feeding.  we are trying to correct it.  cat requires monitoring of amounts of food,0
My yellow ripped through the bedding within a day. Mostly durable except for the light weight fabric on the under side of the bedding.,0
Trash cats don't like the high step and poop outside of it,0
"It tells my dog to stay in the back seat.  However, it would in no way would ever stop him.",0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this litter.  Clumps SUPER hard and lasts much longer than normal clay scoopable litter.  The clumps DO NOT break apart and there is no odor or dust.  Yes, it tracks, but almost every litter does.",1
"Really thin and small. Not worth the money. Would be a better deal to go buy women's pantie liners.

"I did not like this cone at all, it's too heavy. This cone also smells horribly like patchouli, now my house stinks like the thing. I'm throwing it away because I can't stand the smell of it!",0
My dwarf rabbit won't have anything to do with this contraption!! Bummer purchase,0
"I've tried many, many different  treat bags. All of them are good in some ways, and not so good in others. Here's my review of the Tuff Mutt bag:

Pros: 1.  Holds a good amount of kibble
  2.  Material seems very durable
  3.  Poop bag slot is a great idea
  4.  Comes with a starter supply of poop bags
  5.  The extra zippered compartments are handy

Cons:  1.  Elastic, sliding cincher at the opening means the bag is either open or closed; a hinge is more convenient (although hinges are prone to breakage)
  2.  The belt that comes with this bag is of poor quality:  it's very thin, scratchy, and doesn't keep its shape.
  3.  The extra zippered slots are tiny and can be difficult to access

I ended up throwing the included belt away and using a belt from a formerly-used treat bag, which I sewed onto the Tuff Mutt bag.

All in all, I do like the bag, and will continue to use it until improvements have been made or until I find a bag that I like better.",1
"I have 4 adult cats and 2-4 month old kittens.  I also trap, neuter and release ferals.  I give this to ALL of them and I have no gastrointestinal problems whatsoever.  The kittens had diarrhea when I rescued them but within a week of taking this, no more problems.  I give it everyday in their wet food for their immune system.  I would highly advise all pet owners to do the same:)",1
Wonderful crate for my maltese puppy.  It has enough space for a puppy her size.  I especially love the color and it is sturdy.,1
"Great product.  I own two 8 year old Shih-Tzu dogs, and this is far and away their favorite treat.  In fact, both dogs know where the kabobs are stored in the kitchen, and they both lay down near that kitchen cabinet in hopes that they'll get a second or third treat for the night. For me, I  like the fact that they don't gobble them down in 30 seconds.  At least for my two little dogs, the kabobs take about 10 minutes for the dogs to chew through and gobble them down.",1
Dog loved them and helped with her itching,1
This was so worth the money. It only took about 13 days once the lab got the package. We have a blue heeler/border collie!!,1
Dawg thinks its comfy!,1
I Got this for my French bulldog (that weighs about 26lbs) and it looks really good. durable and great quality.,1
"This product seemed wholesome and it was a clever idea to use dried cod instead of rawhide. I am unclear how it can say U.S.D.A. Approved etc. as it is Made in China.  Perhaps that is why they don't show the back of the bag where Made in China is clearly written. Does the approval mean the USDA examines it once it is exported?  I doubt the Chinese are importing U.S. chicken... Plus, the manufacturer noted is TDH Group, not Qingdao Tiandihui Foodstuffs Co., Ltd. which appears under the product name if one should choose to review it.",0
"Bought this April 2016 it's now February 2017 that's a pretty good run for a heavily used inexpensive cat grooming toy. My cat loved running through this while I played with her favorite feather toy. Sprinkle catnip at the base, kitty nirvana lots of stretching and grooming. She used this so much it's now leaning to the side and she still grooms on the lopsided  bristle, kitty don't care.",1
"Waaay tooo small!  The description of this item says it will fit a medium-size dog but apparently they mean a medium-size SMALL dog, like a toy.  Even the tag on the garment states it should fit a miniature poodle, like mine.  Neck to tail he's 14 inches and the length is just that, but the body of the shirt is so tight and narrow with little stretch there was no way this would fit my dog.  Didn't even try to put it on him.  Too much trouble to return, so I will donate to our Poodle Rescue....gotta be some babies over there that can wear this thing.  Very disappointed and my dog is still cold!",0
"I tell you over and over these are so wonderful for teeth and gums of my 2 Minni doggies.  These are and do beat the prices
At any pet store in town.  thank you.",1
"Broke after the first use, way to small, didn't expect the size I got. Not very happy with my purchase.",0
My dog loves these treats,1
"Way too big even using measurements and weight. I would love to be able to exchange for a smaller size. Not everyone has the time to immediately receive package, wash dog and try it on ... so I missed the return date by 2 days.",0
Good,1
"Our cat loves this toy...however, day 1, one ball went missing and a week later, two balls are missing.  She's not a rough cat but the balls come out easy (and I can't find them)!",1
My cats LOVE these! What a great price.,1
"Good golly, I wish I'd come to the land of liners sooner. Not friendly for the environment, but leaves my nose much happier. I think it's far smarter to use these for clumping litter than having to rinse out the pan (now that I live in an apartment and can't just hose the box out in the yard - it's just a plumbing problem waiting to happen to dump rinse water down any kind of drain.)

Very sturdy and fits perfectly over my cat's extra big, extra deep pan. Fan for life.",1
Perfect for our new kitty to keep him safe while we're away!!  Great price too!,1
"Clumps great!  There's really no noticeable forest scent.  Really, I'd suggest using an additional product for odor masking.  I'm considering tossing some feline pine into the mix.",1
"I was excited to use this,but I have found it useless in removing algae from my freshwater tank glass. In addition, it picks up gravel and scratches the tank glass.",0
"This crate is lightweight and really durable. Unfortunately, my puppy chewed off the clip that the zipper is supposed to be secured to, but it's ok since he doesn't paw at the screen too hard.",1
"Love the concept but it arrived defective so I was unable to use it. Could not try it out for
fear it would harm my long haired Chihuahua of 4 1/2 pounds.",1
Hold ups really well and my dog loves them.,1
Dogs couldn't care less that they were getting sprayed! Still kept barking,0
I took a chance that my turtles would love this and I was right.,1
I bought this product for a second time since my puppy chewed the cord off the first one.  When i received the product it was obviously used because it was coated with dog hair!  I had to o clean it and use it because i had no other collar!!! I was extremely disappointed!!!,0
Perfect,1
"This thing is amazing! We own two siberian huskies and their shedding can be horrible. With this tool, it hasn't stopped the shedding but what a huge improvement on getting rid of the loose hair. We've also noticed a dramatic change in how soft their hair is after using it. Great product!",1
This was a good and inexpensive set of toys.  They are not the best quality but my dogs don't really try to destroy toys.,1
Not as good as I expected,0
easy use ez install,1
Griz approves.  Begs for more all the time.  He's is a rescue cat who was  starving - so is in the ravenous mode all the time even when full.,1
This is a great product especially for finicky or picky dogs.  Typically we give our dogs dried food but our recent addition will not eat unless it has gravy.. now she literally drools while waiting for her food,1
the dogs want anything to do with it,0
"I love this new leash! My dogs are about 28 lbs, and are very strong. This leash enables me to have very good control of them while walking for an hour. I highly recommend this product! I bought the leash for larger dogs because mine are so strong, and I'm glad I did.",1
My dog liked watching me roll it around but would not amuse himself with it. Gave it away.,0
"This bed is nice and soft, and seems like it is good quality. It is a very good deal for the price. I bought the 22X6"" size for my kitten, but my 50 pound dog curled up in it instead and seems to really like it.",1
"Please be aware that Dog Food Advisor, a website that rates dog food on quality, has given this product 1.5 stars out of 5.",0
"I don't often take the time to write product reviews but this product is worth the time!  I have had small, countertop betta tanks for years and most recently added one to my desk at work.  It was a real pain changing the water in an office environment so frequently.  I purchased a small tank with a built in filter that was worthless.  Not only was it loud but it did not keep water clear. After some searching, I found this TOM filter.  This thing is amazing.  Not only is it SUPER quiet (I often wonder if it's actually on) but it keeps the water crystal clear!  Now I only change the water about every 3-4 weeks and could probably go longer but choose not to.

I would absolutely purchase another one if the need arises.  Great product!",1
"This gives peace of mind for my family.  We have a fast road in front of our house and a black dog.  Letting him out at night (or day) causes us to worry.  With this, you can see him VERY easily and the large reflector patches are glowing white.  Excellent design that fits him perfectly.  Highly recommended!",1
"My dogs went crazy with these.
They loved it.
Very durable. Lasts ling time.
I would get them again.",1
"9 Lives Cat Foods is one Meal my Cats really Like and enjoy eating it. Tender Carvings with Real Chicken and Salmon in Gravy, one of the many Flavors that is Good for them and I get it Locally. 100% Completed and Balanced Nutrition with all kinds of Vitamins and Nutrients all supposed to be Good for Cats. I can get several Meals out of each Can of Food. My Cats are a little Finicky so I have to try different Flavors and Brands all the time, they enjoy eating it maybe twice a week, they don't eat a lot at one time, they are Nibblers and they like to eat many little Meals. I have tried to give them other more expensive Cat Food from Popular ""Specialty Pet Shops"" or other ""Food Boutiques"" for Pets, however, they didn't want any of that, they Crave and like eating 9 Lives.

"Really nothing special to say about a cat collar - but it's been on my cat for several weeks, and it's still on!  Most collars come off and disappear within a few days.",1
"I just received this item in the mail and we were very excited to get it all set up.  Unfortunately, the parts didn't all fit together.  Practically nothing lined up for part ""C"", i.e. the shelf part that tops the box but isn't the top part.  Literally, the holes & grooves simply didn't line up.  We called the customer service number and haven't heard back from them.  I don't want to send the whole thing back, but I might have to if they don't respond & send us a replacement part!  I saw a complaint about this earlier, but figured they had this straightened out by now.  I cannot recommend this product.",0
"Xylitol is in this product.
It KILLS dogs.

Thank you.",0
"The Kong name is why I purchased this product.  The stuffing is all over the charcoal carpet.  My daughter (who I sent this to) is not a happy camper.  Do not buy this product if there is a chance your dog may tear a toys seam!
I would include a picture but it only allows movie uploads!",0
Okay but not well made especially the food dispenser. Keeps falling from the base and lid will not close. I have seen cheaper one that were better made.,0
We were using another kind and was not getting good results with it. This product really works and now we and our two cats are much happier!! Thank You.,1
Makes my fish tank very colorful!!!,1
"Have been using this kit for over a year now.
Its an essential tool for any fish keeper.
Accurate.  Good instructions.
Highly recommend for all fish keepers - novice to pro.",1
"I love this hoof pick, and it works perfectly.

Previously I had one that looked like a bent Flathead screwdriver.  This has been a fantastic upgrade, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",1
love love love it....worth every penny,1
The netting detached from the handle pretty quickly for not being used very often.,0
It was everything I wanted and more. Simple to install and looks adorable.,1
I opened the package and left it on my kitchen counter. Came back home later and my entire house was stinky. It smells so strong of rubbing alcohol I wasn't willing to even test it on my pet.. I don't want him ingesting that. Tossed it in the trash.,0
"they were bad, humid, not good at all",0
"I bought this one specifically for the promised no leak.. well, still leaks.. it's okay as a bottle overall but.. meh",0
Excellent product,1
Works great after you spend the time and effort training them to use it. It's great.,1
"Grease was coming out the bag, and I didn't think it would b three very large bones n the bag",0
Not safe for pets,0
Amazing booster seat ! My Griffon Belge got used to the seat immediately and often sleeps during our daily car journeys. Fully recommend.,1
my poor cat has many allergies yet Blue Buffalo Freedom cat food does not aggravate them. His coat is silky and shiny since we began feeding him Blue Buffalo and he has no more bumps on his skin from scratching! I'm sure it is such a relief to him.,1
"I have ordered many products.  Nothing worked on my heavily coated Siberian.  I tried the Furminator and it didn't work at all.  I was at wits end and so was my cat when I ordered this as a last resort to shaving.  It works amazingly well. I'm not even sure how it works, but as soon as I ran the rake through my cat it came away with tons of loose fur.  On tough mats, I rake it through gently a few times and it almost always works!  Sometimes I have to gently hold the rake and push the knot into it, but it really seems to gently but incredibly strongly remove most of the mat!  You need to keep cleaning it out because it takes away so much fur and you want it to keep getting a good grip.  I wouldn't even try it around the face or neck area.  I use it mostly for the lower back.  It's the only thing that works!!",1
Love also got my Mom to buy 4 more for her dog outside,1
Velcro is good and strong but these do not stay in place around penis. Having to use both band at the same time to cover male dogs dripping genitals.  The padding is also not very effective.,0
We did not have good results with this product.  Our dog chewed off the clamp used to secure the pad in place about an hour into the first time we tried to use it.,0
The bowl was much thinner metal and than I thought it would be and the hose connection broke before we had even attached to the hose. My main problem with this product is that within two weeks it has a rust mark at the water line.,0
Great for taking your animal out with you. I might buy more as I have 3 cats. If we would need to evacuate these would be great. Good price.,1
"This Kong was a gift from my puppy, Velcro, to per pawpal puppy, Lizzie.

Lizzie loves her kong.  Her human mom, Anna, and her human sister break up the treats in various sizes before putting them into the Kong.  That way some pieces come out easily while Lizzie has to work for others.

Lizzie and Velcro could be poster children for Kongs.",1
"This gate has been awesome in our house! We recently adopted a Pyreneese/Golden mix that had been abused and abandoned. She is taking a bit of training to discipline, but in the meantime we needed a way to block the entryway to our kitchen to keep her out of the kitchen trash and the cat bowls in the room behind our kitchen (poor kitties kept getting their bowls cleaned out!). This gate is tall enough to keep her out and the door is super easy to open one handed to get through. The bonus is that it will also keep our grandson out of the same area when he comes to visit now that he is walking everywhere! We have just stood the gate up and did not mount it to the wall. Our dog is not a jumper, so no worries with it being knocked over. It is nice and sturdy metal. Definitely a great purchase for us.",1
"Nice product, my puppy loves them...",1
this didn't work on my dogs so im bumming I spent the money that I did on it....it just wasn't enough to make them stop barking :( I think my next option will have to be shock collar...I will contact supplier and see if they can help me  :),0
Might be a useful product if my dog would use. She just doesn't like it at all.,0
The dogs eat it but way to expensive,0
Seemed to be well built but my 5 month old puppy chewed it up in less than 15 mins. I emailed the mfg and they never responded to me.,0
I have a Lhasopoo and her hair type needs constant grooming but she is sensitive about her paws. This works great on all areas but around her paws she has a tendency to try and yank away which sometimes results in the knot getting yanked instead of pulling through the blades of the comb. Still overall a nice product for maintaining dogs with hair instead of fur and preventing matting and the need to cut out chunks.,1
"High quality, great price and very fast shipping. My dog was able to learn to use the bells quickly following the enclosed directions. Highly recommend",1
"My cat is used to Fancy Feast Grilled but eats all the gravy and leaves dried out pieces that I have to add a little warm water to for him to finish. So, I tried this product for Gravy Lovers which he does not like because it is minced, he prefers the grilled pieces, he does not like classic either.",0
I liked the old scent a lot.  No issues with allergies myself so I can't comment - plus I only use it for litter box odors and not on the rug.  Anyhoo.  The new scent has this fake chemical cleanser smell I find nauseating.  Reminds me of the cheap motel room smell you get stuck in because nothing else is available.  I'm looking for a replacement product,0
"The reviews for this item were very helpful when deciding on a cover for the back seat. My fiancee and I have a black lab, collie mix; even though he is a little older than three months, I went ahead and order this for him! He likes the feeling and color of the fabric! This cover actually helps him cool down, since our seats are black and hot most of the time. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone! By the way, very quick shipping!",1

Bulk is best chickens and ducks love them!,1
the bottle comes out too easily...very disappointing.,0
I could see what looks like water droplets in the valves and the item arrived loose in an envelope from China.  Does not appear to be a new packaged product.  Maybe it was tested for reliability before shipping but I don't like seeing water droplets of mysterious origin in products that are not indicated as used.  I threw mine away rather then risk failure or contamination with the mentioned water droplets.,0
As for myself they are find but my fish simply won't eat this stuff,0
"I bought these for my dog, I even tried measuring his paws to make sure I ordered the right size but they did not fit. They fall off very quickly.",0
Very small good for a dog well under 10lbs,0
Sharp and blunted... Safe for your pet's sensitive areas.,1
I have been getting DGP for my elderly giant schnauzer for a few years now.  It appears to really help her.  Thank you.,1
Did nothing to help or hurt our dog during the storm.,0
"We have been ordering these for 11 months now and they perform flawless, I just wish they were cheaper because a 100 per month becomes expensive but again fantastic product!! AAA +++",1
My 1 yr old German short hair pointer had the end chewed off in less than an hour. I wouldn't recommend this product.,0
"We tried these on our arthritic 9 year old min pin.  Used the whole bottle and followed the instructions but unfortunately we did not see results on our dog.  We really, really wanted these to work but we're disappointed.  We never experienced any trouble giving these to him.  He loved them!",0
It may work well for a dog with a long snoot.  The dogs with pushed in faces can't get the water.,0
"I bought this in an attempt to curb my cats urge to drink from any and every available faucet. At first, I thought this was a great solution, but she didn't like it. I ended up spending a couple weeks carrying her away from the faucet to this fountain in attempt to redirect her urges. Even now, a month later she only begrudgingly drinks from the top of this fountain, and never drinks the falling water as she likes to do from the faucet.

After about a week, I think I might have figured out why she only begrudgingly drinks from this. After the first week, every waterline was black. I rinsed the coal filter exceedingly well before use, and let the fountain run a while before pouring the water out and putting in *pre-filtered water*. Even after that I got a black gunk at the waterline, at the bottom of the bowl, and building quickly (in a matter of days) on the edges (I fill the fountain to near capacity). I've kept the fountain on a counter to help the cat transition, so I know nothing unusual is falling into the fountain.

This is the fourth time in one month I've seen the fountain look dirty, with grime at the bottom of the bowl, on the sides and building at the waterline. The pictures are very mild compared to how yucky it was the first time, which was just terrible 1 week after start of use.

Anyway, after I found the grime the first time, I cleaned the fountain and wiped away all the black. A week later, it was back again, though not as badly, and every few days I find it like it looks in the pictures. It's not serving the purpose I hoped it would, my cat doesn't like it or the water it filters, the sound of falling water is LOUD even with the fountain as full as you can manage, and it's high maintenance for cleaning. For the price, I expected something more efficient at filtering, cleanly, lower maintenance, and at the very least, something my cat would drink from without constant encouragement.

Wish I still had the box to return it.",0
Poorly made. Doesn't hold small pills. I don't like this product and would not recommend it,0
Cat loved it!,1
Our dogs love it.  Been a satisfied customer for many years.,1
"My bantams  and guineas go nuts for these, they are spoiled birds.",1
My dog loves it he a lab/cattle dog mix weighs about 80 lb he can stretch out curl up whatever he feels like with plenty of room,1
I am not happy with the quality. The plastic is thin. The snaps are likely to rip because it's so thin. I bought a medium for my Bichon and it's really tight. I wouldn't recommend this coat.,0
I have to say the customer service is hands down beyond excellent! I bought this 2yrs ago and thought I had a 5yr warranty when in fact I only had a one yr needless to say I contacted them with a concern and they replaced it with no problem! This works wonders on my 200lb mastiff ,1
"This is a really great price for a large quantity of good bio media!  The 5 pounds of media will fill a gallon canister filter. These ceramic rings are comparable to most of the brand name ones, and better than some of them.  While better or equal to the brand names, it is the cheaper than any other generic one I found.

There are some new designs of ceramic rings with a really rough surface they claim will result in more beneficial bacteria. The are knock-offs of the legendary ""Bacteria House"" product.  They are much, much more expensive and not without drawbacks, which raises doubts for me that they are actually better in the average person's aquarium filter.  Those extra rough rings were designed for use in wastewater treatment and koi pond filters, where the very high flow rate of water in those applications helps keep the media rinsed free of debris build up.  In a typical aquarium filter with lower flow rates, the rough surface texture of those rings will trap lots more debris, which reduces the effectiveness of a bio media.  I want the bio media in a filter to have a surface texture that is small enough for a bacteria or archaeon, but not so large as to trap fish poo, dead plant leaves, and uneaten food.  The ceramic ring bio medias like this one, were deliberately designed to reduce the accumulation of debris on the media, while still providing a porous structure for beneficial microbes to colonize.

Before I started using these in my filter, I wanted the test to see how porous they are.  Unlike plastic bio balls that only support bacteria on their surface, ceramic rings should also allow water and bacteria inside the media.  To test these, I dipped the end of one ring in some red food coloring.  It quickly sucked it up like a sponge, and the entire ring was an even red color.  To see the inside, I wrapped it in a paper towel and smashed it with a hammer.  The inside structure of the media was also evenly red.

Unlike a sponge that compresses and loses volume when water is flowing through it, ceramic rings keep their shape and volume.  These ceramic rings are small enough they will fit well in small spaces without leaving large voids.  At the same time, the hole through each ring is large enough to allow free flow of water and resist clogging.  For a good bio media, I don't want a surface area with holes big enough for visible things to grab hold and live.  I want tiny microbes to move in and make their home within and on the surface of the media.

I have been keeping fish for nearly 50 years, and I have tried lots of filtration media in that time.  The price, size, shape, texture, and porosity of these rings made them the perfect choice for me.  I am using them in an over the tank, wet-dry filter and in canister filters for another tank.  They will work with any hang on the back filters that is shaped so water can flow freely through the media, such as ones that have a compartment for carbon media.

Being one of the cheapest ceramic rings available, you may not want these if you enjoy bragging to others about how much you've spent on exclusive brands. ;-)",1
"I hate to have to write a 1 star review but I'm doing to prevent others from going through this unpleasant exercise.
The Mattress never expanded. After unpackaging this bed my arthritic friend Lexi and I anxiously watched, for 4 days, so she could rest her old bones on it...it never fully expanded. We were both very disappointed.
I'm going to attempt a return. Amazon wants the bed back so that leaves me with the task of somehow repackaging this beast in a way that UPS will accept for shipping. I was looking to comfort an old friend and ended up with 'Mission Impossible'.  It's hard to believe they're still selling this item (check the 1 and 2 star reviews) and to top it off it's listed as an 'Amazon Choice' item.
Bottom line: If you want to remain a happy person don't take a chance on buying this pet bed.",0
"I have 2 cats. One BIG one small.

Worked nice for a week until I noticed my cat pooped on floor.  Went to clean it & noticed pee under litter box. This happened twice.  Thank goodness I had the foresight to seal it. So, I need to buy a litter box with top, but most don't fit. I'm probably going to take the door off & the back to make room for your average litter box with top. Plus the cats are scratching the door up. Bummed.

IMPORTANT~The measurements inside are smaller than stated with door closed. 18.5 "" is the true depth with the door closed. This is important.

MATERIAL PREP~ I also was concerned about the material soaking in urine over time. To help with that issue, I brushed on 2 coats of clear coat inside & on door edges to be able to wipe it clean when accidents happen. Glad I did. It did turned a slightly yellow inside due to clear coat, but necessary.

This item would be ideal if it came with a litter box with a better spray wall or they lacquered the parts to resist saturation.",0
Great toys and what I have given my dog to play with hold up OK not for a medium size dog,1
"Tower itself is not sturdy at all. Leans to the side & wobbles a lot when my cats jump on the top part of it. The middle part doesn't stay still, you can literally turn it to the right for hours & it never tightens. The middle part is also not a hard surface, it's just the material they used to wrap the other gray parts of the tower... maybe they were going for a hammock effect? Either way it scares me when my 10lb cat lays on the middle part due to it not being a hard surface at all, it literally looks like it's about to snap off. The bottom part is a great size though.",0
"Our labrador had an awful allergy. She would get an itchy face and rub it all over the walls until her face bled. We tried benedryl at our vet's advice, and it didn't really help. I did research and found out it could be a grain allergy. After I switched to this product our dog stopped rubbing her face raw. Both of our dogs seem to think it's delicious, too. Well worth the cost.",1
"I have a 40 lb Red Heeler that plays hard and chews harder. This is the one toy that's outlasted them all. LOVE it! We can tug with everything we got all day and this ball goes and goes. The first one started showing a couple small cracks after a year so I gave it to a Rotty puppy to extend it's useful life. Bought another and after another year no cracks at all. It's much better than anything I've seen at Petco or Petsmart.

It's worth noting a slight issue that's related to the animals teeth/jaw size and the persons finger size:
It's a little tricky getting my fingers in the holes for tug wars, but he knows to wait until I'm ready. I have to watch and be careful if his teeth get a little stuck on the holes sometimes. No biggey he gets himself unstuck easily, but still we have look out for each other when playing with this ball.",1
Stinky and stale...yuk!,0
It works.  What more can I say?,1
I like this thermometer. It suctions to the tank glass and you can put it were ever. It is not that hard to read the temp. I would buy this again.,1
"I've gotten several bags of these pig ears and they're usually great.  This bag was awful.  They aren't chewy at all and they're super small.  My dog eats them like chips, when he has interest in them at all.",0
"VERY SMALL! I'll be lucky if this lasts my dog half a day. The squeakers are about 1"" in siE and are it well padded so a single bite will render them useless. Save your money.",0
Does what it is supposed to. It beats getting a mouth full of dirty aquarium water.,1
"My experience is similar to the other one star reviews.  It started beeping when I put it on, it beeped when the dog walked, it beeped no matter what my dog did.  Any little noise or shaking or walking set the beep off.  Upsetting and unhelpful.",0
I am not happy with these as the plastic tabs provided do not fit into the window to hold the cover in place.  They are large enough to protect the door but will not fit as shown in the picture.  I do not want to use the velcro provided as I am afraid it will damage the surface it is affixed to.  I bought them because I thought they would go into the window space - which would have been perfect.  I will have to return them.,0
Poor quality..they broke it within 10 minutes.,0
Too big for my little dog! :(,0
"Only been running for 4 days, but so far-so good.  Watched BRS video on how to install.",1
Thanks for a wonderful toy for our furbebs! They love it.,1
"Easy to use. Pill gun and bam, done.",1
My little dog just loves sleeping in her little bed since I have this in there now. With her sweater I know that she is nice & warm. great product.,1
Made for a tiny dog not anything I could use.,0
"I bought one of these fleas about 3 months ago.  It was excellent quality, stood up to a very rigorous german shepherd puppy.  It had a red collar around its neck.
We recently moved, and the old flea was lost, so I ordered a new one.  I ordered the exact same item, but when it came, it wasn't the same.  It has fur around its neck instead of the red collar, is quite a bit smaller, a slightly different color, and i could tell immediately that the quality was far inferior.  Our first flea with the red collar was awesome, the best dog toy ever!!
The new version with the fur around its neck is a terrible imitation.  Im not sure what happened but it is no longer the same quality.  Hence the conflicting reviews on here.  Older versions were fantastic, the new ones just plain suck.",0
"I bought it for my 95 lbs American Bulldog. The lead is strong and soft, the only think I did not like about id is that the snap hook is small/medium and could not be used to fit large D ring that most large dogs would have on their collars... I just bought a new snap hook and installed it on this leash.... love it!",1
Works very well and my dog loves them!,1
This the best spray catnip I've found that my cats like.,1
"I never like to give any product 1star, but this toy deserves it.  I searched for ""aggressive chewers"" & this toy got great reviews.  My 9 mo old black lab who is normal; not a Marley, chewed through the pocket & had all the stuffing out of the shark within 3 hrs.  Loser toy for him/ me & now I have to pay for shipping to return it when I am Prime.  I would add a photo but the screen blacked--out for some reason.",0
"I'll say is shocks, I strapped it to my neck and let the dog go crazy, its really not that bad, after all human necks a lot more sensitive than a dogs. I personally didn't like the product. It worked for a while I think, but are dog doesn't bark much to begin with. We go the thing to stop here barking when i came home late, and between living in a family apt. complex and my wife getting up early for work, a shock collar was the alternative to spanking the dog (which was how we trained her to be quiet but now she's just being a smart b***) After a month the collar has started to make that warning sound when she shakes. WTF its only suppose to do that if she barks... I should have just spent the extra $50 and bought a real training collar... my advice save your money its crap after a month",0
"Keeps my puppy so fresh. Kodas coat is so smooth and fluffy, no more stinky knotted haired pups. I give him a bath using Pet head shampoo with a little Doggie fragrance and he keeps a sweet smell to him instead of dirty now. Smell doesn't last super long but it it keeps him as I said ""fresh."" Pretty satisfied",1
Our Tibetan Terrier puppy (4 months old) LOVES these! All natural and a great buy!,1
"I'm sorry, the smell of the product is so awful, I have to throw it away and get something else.",0
"My dog, who is a 6 month old Labrador, had this for 20 minutes before it was shredded into five different pieces.  If I buy from this company again I will seriously have to do my homework.",0
Didn't work for my dog. I've wasted a lot of money trying to combat allergies in my dog naturally. This was one more mistake.,0
"I bought this harness to help my obese cat exercise. He was too fat for it. It fit my other cat fine, and he loves it!",1
"This is a great carrier, but too small for my 12 lb. Jack Russell Terrier.",1
"Yes, yes and Yes!  The bag arrived on time And my cat is eating it,  so I feel better because A).  I don't like to support the animal slaughter industry by feeding commercial pet foods to my cat, and B). I feel these foods are substandard anyway.  ( Google what goes into canned and dried commercial pet foods.  I read that the pet food industry is unregulated).
Although,  I am weaning her off the commercial cat foods slowly by mixing the Ami cat food in her bowl with it.",1
My dogs adore these!,1
LOVE IT! No complaints.,1
"2 stars because I do like the tool for applying the medicine, unfortunately it doesnt work.... my indoor cat has even had ticks once starting this stuff.",0
"I have a chubby yorkie, the perseverance fits but I think it needs more of whatever may help him stay afloat. Workmanship is good, but leery the device itself will fail.",0
Absolute best option for the price,1
This pearl necklace looks awesome in my 10 pound bichon. Good quality and the most important thing is that they are not heavy,1
nice for small bird or parrot but not for African Grey.,0
"Great in so many ways, but their is a flaw.  Where the legs meet the bottom of the cage, all four corners of my cage pulled away.  This led to the grate and tray beneath to fall down.  This means any animal in cage could escape.  Fortunately none of my birds got out as this happened while I was moving the cage.  I have used wire to hold it together for now, may need to get some zip ties.

I bought this cage 7 months ago, I roll it around and the bottom just can't take regular moving.  If don't plan to move the cage much, it will probably be ok.  This has a serious design flaw!!  I should give it one star, but for those NOT planning to move the cage much, it is a cheap solution.",0
works wonderful with both my dogs!!,1
"I have bought this hay from amazon for 3 months now, and it's come fresh and ready for my guinea pigs to nom nom nom on!

Very competitive prices makes this one a no-brainer. Ditch the brown Kaytee hay and give ur piggies something they'll squeal over :P",1
"Fits my large Miniature Schnauzer perfectly. The hat isn't authentic looking but the overall affect is perfect. Substantial and well-made for a dog costume. Wolfgang does a good yodel, too.",1
"My Yorkie Bruno loves these, my problem is how expensive they are.",1
Does not work. Did not prevent any marking. Do not buy.,0
"My dog, as she grows older, is starting to rattle this more and more, but so far it's been durable. Pretty mobile too. Overall a good way to keep the pet in public areas of the house without letting him/her run amok.",1
These blankets are great.  I've owned them for years now and never stray from this product.  My only complaint and hence the 4 starts instead of 5 is after 3 months the front starts to open up and rubs my horses hair off.  I wish Tough-1 would cure this problem.,1
"I've bought 6 of these (I have 6 rabbits) and I honestly thought the top fill water bottle would be the best and easiest bottle to work with. I was wrong, at least with this particular bottle. All they do is LEAK! From the moment I opened, washed, and filled for my rabbits.. they do nothing but leak water all over their hutches. It's really terrible and rather annoying! I will be searching for a new bottle to try. THUMBS DOWN!",0
This is the best toy ever for my yorkies.,1
I found my puppys pee under pad many times. The pad is not working.,0
Works great.,1
"I give this product one star as it advertised 2 speeds and only one works.  Speed one does not turn the product on and Speed 2 is not strong/fast enough to trim down my 5 lb puppy's nails.  Perhaps i got a defective product but I'm not going to chance it and try again.  Yes, it's inexpensive and the shipping was very quick but unfortunately the product was a complete disappointment. I would rather pay a little more for a product that will work.",0
"I threw it out after 10 attempts my dog made to climb the stairs.  They collapse in on themselves, the prongs holding them are very small and do not do the job.  Do not waste your money.  My dog weighs only 8 pounds and it did not hold her.",0
My cocker spaniels love this but they both are heavy chewers and can easily chew the corners off. My male cocker even ate the plastic soft connector rod....love the product but it's not a safe toy for my dogs.,0
Only got 4 deliverer 6 of them are missing do not waste your money on this product,0
SIze chart is for people not dogs/ I am very disappointed,0
"Too rich, made my dog sick, even though I tried to introduce slowly.  Vet suggested not feeding it to non-show dogs",0
Our dog developed a bright red itchy rash the next day after using this product. It was returned.,0
"after feeding my dog this food for a week he stinks , smells like a goat ! taking the rest to the humain society",0
"Piece of crap, poor construction and the dogs don't even notice the shock, I wouldn't ever buy anything made by them again",0
These bones made my dog sick.  She threw up every day she had ate one.  I would not recommend giving these to your dog!!  They should be recalled!!,0
They taste great,1
I really like this dog food! And most important so do my two small dogs! Their coats and eyes never looked better. And I believe that is due to this great food!,1
"I bought this because my puppy chews through every toy I buy him.  The vet recommended
Nyla Bone. He's had it for a number of weeks now and hasn't put a dent in it.  This is good if your pet chews and swallows everything he gets his/her paws on.",1
Our dog got sick from this product. Don't buy these treats are from China. Our little dog has renal failure.,0
What are they thinking? These are huge for a cat. You'd have to pulverize them and then figure out how to give them to your cat! really???,0
"tuna and whitefish flavor.  neither of 3 persian cats liked it.  none!
also bought same flavor chowder -- same reaction...
have no idea what's going on...  usually they eat everything that has tuna in it.
trying to avoid chicken flavors due to excessive hormones, etc.",0
After a short time the bulb is now blown.,0
This product is definitely not for xl dogs as it says. The washer portion leaks. The scrubber works amazing though. I would say this is much more for a small to medium dog.,0
neither ball squeaks. I have bought this ball many times and first time it never worked,0
did not work for my dog. We live in Florida and there are a lot of fleas so we had to go with something stronger.,0
"Recently purchased the bunny and my dog really seemed to enjoy it at first. However, when turned back for a second, he had ripped the musical component out and thoroughly apart. There were tiny shards of hard plastic and metal everywhere (including the little batteries). I would've thought the fabric would have been quite a bit better than it turned out to be. If you have a dog that likes to rip out the squeaker from toys, please be careful with this toy.",0
I did not like the Thundershirts. I bought 3 for my dogs. It made my dogs cough a lot and not breath well. Cant use them.,0
Fell apart after one wash :(,0
They don't stay on my dogs feet,0
"Into the trash after the first use.  Good in concept but it just doesn't work.  Suction cup lasts for an hour or two.  But more importantly, our frustrated pup (60lb lab mix) tore it up on the first try.  The bone shaped section is fairly thin plastic that was easy for her to chew up and shred.",0
Although this looked good in the add - it was much smaller and my < 16 lb cockapoo didn't fit.  It would work for really really small dogs.,0
"Not as bright as it seems, enough wattage to pierce water for coral growth... Easy to retrofit.  I've only had them for about 2 weeks on my tank... So we'll see how waterproof they are, but they're holding up fine now.  This is the white one, it's only really for us to see into the tank... The blue and full spectrum ones will work for Corals, mine seem to thrive and reach toward the light.  I have 3 of these, this white one.  The full spectrum one, and the blue one, they all link together and attach perfectly to the ledenet dimmer.  I like them and they are adequate lighting for corals, excellent for fish only systems and great if you want to retrofit a tank and not break the bank.",1
"So worth the money definitely helped me with an unruly pooch, highly recommend!",1
"Very sharp, making it easier & more stress free for both dog & groomer. I used these to trim the feet on my Samoyed & they work beautifully. I used them this morning to trim my Yorkie & he was calm & happy while I snipped around his face & eyes. I am very please with these & the price was great. Service was fast.",1
"Top piece did not fit do to the screw either being stripped or the hole in the bottom
not accepting it. pass",0
Easy way to test your water without the usual complications.,1
I bought it in July.  By November (even before the cold weather had really started) it had cracked near the top of the rim for no reason I am able to ascertain.  I had to discard it shortly thereafter as began to leak enough that I had serious loss of water from the pond.,0
I really like the idea of this but my two gerbils personally don't care one bit about this. Nibbled it once and never touched it again.,0
This has changed our dog walking from a three ring circus to a one ring!!! Works like a charm!!,1
Very large and cover as much as we need.  We have not had one leak yet.,1
"We bought this to replace my lab mix's most beloved ball EVER!! She was happy to get the new one, but loves her old one so much that I'm afraid to toss it for fear of breaking her heart....seriously!! That original ball has lasted nearly 4 years and is just now in need of replacing. Not only has my girl played with this daily, but my other lab/pit mix has contributed to it's demise in the last two years. Both of my dogs are large, aggressive power chewers and I am very pleased with how well this ball has held up. I highly recommend it!",1
My cat had a collar similar to this one just a different brand and it got stuck in her mouth like the other cats in these reviews. Do not buy unless you plan on modifying it to make it a breakaway collar! This is ridiculous. I wish I read the reviews on these before I bought one for my cat at Target.,0
GARBAGE,0
These are not chips they are small trachea tubes.  My dog normally loves these and they have always come in small chips.  This time they cams as full round small trachea tubes.  So disappointed.  He can't chew these.,0
"I got this collar for our miniature schnauzer to control his barking when I'm walking him.  It doesn't spray every time and, when it does, he just kind of shakes his head and goes on barking.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0
"Much like the movie, this thing was gone in 60 seconds. My bull terrier got a hold of this by accident and ripped it to shreds.",0
My son's betta fish got stuck in one of the side windows; we managed to get him out but he was quite injured. DO NOT PURCHASE.,0
Pikachu loves the top of the carrier. Not the bottom but she would lay in it if she has too. She is not afraid to get in it. I have not taken her outside with it yet. I want her to adjust to the carrier first. I love the quality this was well worth the money. I can tell it will last for a very long time. The bag isn't too heavy not sure if i wll carry it with the strap. The inside is soo soft what is that mink. If I was smaller I would ball up in it. I am impressed and very satisfied with this purchase !,1
"Bought this blanket as a gift for my friend. Baby loves them! They are cotton and very soft. She is using blankets at night, after showers, when she is feeding .",1
Not worth the price,0
"Amazing! We bought this in hope that our 1 year old cat would stop jumping on our TV stand, and it worked like a charm! He loves it, so much so that we don't get as many cuddles!  Easy and fast assemly, had it out together in 10-15 minutes easy. I recommend this to all of my cat loving friends!",1
"I have a German Shepherd mix, and lets just say restrainment in any form can be difficult. He's only 2 years old and has already gone through 3 leashes, 5 collars and 3 outdoor runner cables. Needless to say, we found out pretty soon that nylon or cloth leashes of any form do not work. He chews right through them and within minutes would be free. I figured in order to bring him on car rides, I would like to be able to have him in the backseat without him having free reign and destroying the interior of the car. This leash is so easy to use- just clip it on the seatbelt loop on the top of the seat and attach to his collar. I figured this design would work a lot better than the leashes that clip right into the seatbelt- knowing him, he would figure it out and unclip himself. Overall this leash clip is very sturdy and has help up so far. Very pleased with the results and would recommend to anyone.",1
This is highly overrated. Cats have had other cheaper brands and liked them. This they ignored.,0
Bait and switch. No wire doesn't mean no wire  Deff not wireless....,0
good,1
"They give you an array of fittings to go with the unit, but most either don't fit or they're basically useless. Were I to do it again, I'd choose anpther brand, which I'm going to do. On the good side, if all you're looking for is a circulation pump to keep water moving and aerated, this is a cheap unit that will do that for you.",0
The pieces are too small.  Maybe it should be for small dogs only.,0
"My dog is small and this was still a little bit big for her--she's a 6lb chihuahua. It was raining very hard, but the jacket did a good job of keeping her as dry as it could during a downpour.",1
My cat loves this! I was skeptical because she never plays with toys we buy her but this? She LOVES it. I definitely recommend!,1
These don't seem medium to me. The package said small/medium but are too small. I need just another size up. So I ordered the large package and they are way too big. There is a huge gap between medium and large with this company and it's now become frustrating.,0
Wow. This is amazing stuff. My chickens love it and my eggs are delicious. It feels to give them food that I can identify with my eyes.,1
"Extremely small. Good for a kitten or puppy. Not good for grown animals. You'll have to refill the food dish several times a day/night. Holds about 1/3 cup of dry cat food with small pieces.  Water bottles are not included, and the bottle tops do not fit into dish well. Made a hell of a mess with water. Fit less than a 1/2 cup of water at a time in basin. Dishes have a very sharp chemical  plastic smell, did not go away when washed three times. Won't  trust it for my boys. Wish I hadn't wasted my money. Have requested a refund.",0
great..,1
Thanks,1
"Large size but fits well under the sink.  Perfect for the corner.  Holds an entire ""jug"" of litter.",1
my cat absolutely will not use this litter box and now my floors are in constant mess. I want my money back its sad. i even bought 6 extra trays of this litter after reading reviews and researching litters yet this just doesn't work for the cat. please help!,0
"I haven't used this for travel yet, but this seems like everything I had hoped to get in a carrier, and I'm sure it will be relatively comfortable for my dog once we need to use it. I will probably have to plop him inside through the top rather than get him to walk through the end, so it's nice that it has a zip-top feature.",1
"Great toy for a large dog (Rotty in this case)! So far it has held up just fine, but he hasn't really gone beyond playing with it at this point...we will wait and and see.",1
Wrong size screws furnished with door. You have to take a 11./64 drill bit to enlarge holes so you can screw them in.,1
"It Says on it 220V in the description.

I received it on the device it said 110V and on the datasheet and instruction it said 110-250V.

I hooked it up according to the instruction and it worked fine for 2-3 min then went up in smoke!",0
"We only feed our dogs Purina.  We mix this in with dry food and they love it.  We have 4 big dogs (shepard, hound, doberman, mix) all 70 - 100 lbs.  My old dog, Blue, is 13 years old and is in good health due to Purina.  He has teeth problems, so the soft food is easier to eat.",1

"My beagle is a picky girl.  Most rawhides get tucked in between the cushions and forgotten about until she realizes that I've moved it to her basket.  These she takes, lays down and eats until they are gone.  She only gets one a month when the subscription order comes so Amazon boxes are her favorite!",1
I'm already getting a low battery signal after only a week. I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware!,0
I bought this clipper May of this year and I have used it about six times to groom my 2 dogs. It DOES really cuts well but this product is loud. It's even louder than the old one I got from WalMart. And this clipper also gets hot after about 20 minutes of use. I was dissappointed about it for the price I paid.,0
"If you have a small dog like my 6.5 pound chihuahua, you will definitely want a brush with a compact head. However, the bristles (like all the other brushes I have used....aside from one product) are still the same length which makes it difficult to fit between my dog's lip and teeth. This makes the product useless. I had to give the entire set away.",0
"They stink. The only other order I've ever got that smelled this bad was hair from overseas. Which made sense when I read the label and saw they were made in China.  Anyway,  despite them looking amazing, I won't be giving these to my dogs.",0
"We could not get the treat out of this thing to save our lives.  My dogs would have been tortured all day with this if I left them alone, even after I adjusted the prongs.  Total waste",0
"Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to get a fine line dot for my cat to chase. This pointer projects a large paw print on your wall. My cat wasn't the least interested. This was a waste of money in my opinion. If someone else has purchased this and can tell me how to adjust it to function as a standard laser pointer, please let me know.",0
The powder stinks!  It smells really bad.  I tried it twice on different occasions with different vacuums.  Maybe I have a bad batch?  Or perhaps it just smells awful.  A total waste of money.,0
I bought this product in hopes that it would work for my two Chihuahua's and my puggle. My two Chihuahua's bark at anything and my puggle goes along with the flow but her bark is very high pitched with a whinning / howling sound. This product nevers goes off when my dogs bark and I have to manually push the bottom in order for it go off. The reason I bought it is because I live in an apartment complex and when I come home my dogs will bark and bark and bark until I come through the dog and I'm hearing complaints. I wanted something that would work automatically. I didn't want to put collars on my Chihuahua's (I would never use the shock collars but I'm looking into the spray collars). They're only 6 pounds each and they never go outside. The last time I tried to put collars on them they totally flipped out. My puggle is trained to go outside so she wears a collar 24/7. Oh well....needless to say this product does not work and I wish I could return it.,0
"I have been a foster mom for a lot of dogs and the gentle leader is the only thing I've used that will prevent pulling.  It is also less likely to injure the dog  then a collar around the neck.  Recently we got a dog who is very fearful and did not want to walk. She would lag behind  and it was not very fun to go on walks.  It seems like the gentle leader gave her more confidence and she does not pull back anymore.  I have even gone back to regular collars and harnesses just to see if the dog would stop pulling  after using the gentle leader for awhile.  Unfortunately as soon as the gentle leader is, gone they realize that they can pull and are all too happy to do so!  It takes at least several years until a puppy will calm down so that you can forgo use of the gentle leader and go back to regular collar.  It is really a great product",1
Good quality for the price.,1
"I haven't used this product but I want to caution all potential customers. I did some research on the ingredients list. It does seem grain free but potatoe free is a loose term. The ingredients do not say potatoes are used in the product, however there are yams listed and jicama, which is a fancy term for Mexican yams. I'm not purchasing this product based on this deceiving advertisement.",0
"This feeder works wonderfully for us.  It took a while to figure out how to use it properly.  Once we did, it's the best feeder we've had.  It doesn't leak, like so many reviewers complained about.  We've had wind gusts up to 50 mph, with no leaks.

It took a while for the hummingbirds to figure out the perches, but once they did, they're here all the time.

Truly a pleasure to fill from the top.  You just need to remember to close the container (push down)before filling it.  Then pull up and you're set to go.

Also much easier to clean this feeder than any other feeder we've had to date.

The hummingbirds now love it and are fighting for space.",1
great small idea,1
Never worked.  I even did what the instructions said to make sure it didn't overflow.  It would never shut off.,0
Clever and unique dog toy. Squeekie lasts long than most toys. My little Chi loves it and it is his favorite.,1
"This is a very heavy and stiff cone that my puppy not only refused to wear but also got catatonic upon putting on. I have never seen her act this way before. We got the long one after measuring her as directed and it was way too long! She could not see a thing around her and she was terrified... We ended up returning this and getting her a shirt to prevent her from chewing the spay site. I would not recommend this item to anyone, especially for how expensive it is.",0
Its very nice leather and looks great on my tin cup chuwawa.,1
Great value !!!,1
birds love it,1
"Thank you for this incredible product! Keeping a balance for carb intake and hydration has long been part of our success in dock diving. This product stands out because of the 10 essential canine amino acids. I notice a distinct improvement in our prolonged competitions with the addition of these canine specific amino acids when it comes to energy over time. The biggest impact is it has really helped even out energy spikes and falls that I have found in other products that just have simple sugar carbohydrates. The consistent, stable energy provided by Drool Fuel has become an integral part of our performance and training routines for Team O-Dog. Thank you for helping us stay at the top of our game",1
"This crate looked nice and set up easily when i received it, but it didn't last long.  I have a mid sized dog, a wheaton terrior, with a strong will.  She broke the crate within 2 weeks,  She scratched and scratched at the bars next to the door, some of the metal bars started to fall off.  She broke out of the crate one day!!!  The crate I had previously lasted 6 years and it was still strong, but the bars were starting to get rusted and the plastic tray at the bottom was cracked, so I bought this new crate.  Now I wish I had kept the old one.",0
"It took my puppy, a 2 month old Goldendoodle that weighs about 10 pounds, less than a minute to figure out how to escape!! He put his paws up on the edge of the pen, then leaned forward which bent the side down enough to easily hop out. It's a better place to keep his toys temporarily. It might take them a little longer to get out on their own!",0
Awesome product! Bought this because I use a 5 gallon plastic pail to transport charcoal and lighter fluid for camping trips. I was tired of struggling to get the lid off of my plastic pail. The Seal Lid was the ticket. Easy to put on and easy to take off. It also has an O-ring to keep things properly sealed. No buyers remorse here!,1
I have big hands and the scent keeps the smell at bay. Big enough for the biggest loads.,1

Bought them for my senior dogs. Cant use em.",0
I gave 2 stars because this looks to be more of a small than a large. I ordered a large and what I got definitely looks like a small even though it says large on the bowl. It's not big enough for my Sir Sir ( baby iguana) to bathe in.,0
"Crapped out on me after a year. Went with Tetra whisper along with internal sponge filter, has been a good setup for the 2 years.

This was also so loud which I never liked.  If I ever go Fluval again I'll try the canister filter instead",0
"I have two of these and after a year with them, I'm ready to replace both of them.  The first one at about nine months, one side doesn't produce air any more.  I've checked there isn't a blockage in the tubing, it just doesn't produce anything.  The other side is still going strong.  The second one after nine months has become very loud and annoying.  I've tried various things to quiet it, covering, suspending, insulation, nothing works.",0

As a cat owner / serious animal lover who is very cautious about what products to use with my animals, I am very pleased with this product.

"These are tiny marble sized moss balls.  My main gripe was that 2 of them were falling apart when I got them.  For being so small, once it falls apart it's small enough where it'll just get sucked up during water changes. You can get one giant ball at Petco for the same price and there will be more moss in that one giant ball than all 6 nano balls combined.  I regret this purchase.",0
"these are the best additions to my family, plenty of room for the k9 kids and I know they are safe as well as my rugs are safe",1
"This is an extremely dangerous toy.  The toys are marketed as durable, tuff and ""built to last through the most aggressive play!""  We  had the toy less than a week, and my dog was able to remove the squeaker from the toy. It is a major hazard and design defect.  My dog is not an aggressive dog or ""player,"" and the squeaker, which was swallowed whole, was the perfect size to get stuck in the area between the small intestines and colon. Because the squeaker is clear, it was not recognizable on the barium X ray. I want to alert you to this very serious problem.  My dog almost died and had major surgery totaling over $4000.  I contacted the company, they will not step up to the plate, and told me that this ""never happens.""  Not true, now that I am reading the other reviews on Amazon.  I wish I had known this before I bought the toys, they should be pulled from the shelves until this design of the squeaker is modified or until the squeakers are removed from all the products. The company should also stand behind its products and their marketing.",0
"This came in just TWO DAYS, which is great because the reason I even bought this was because my pit bull puppy was chewing on and destroying everything when I wasn't home. It was a VERY easy setup once I received it and is REALLY sturdy. Very good quality for the price and even came with a plastic pan underneath for accidents. LOVE IT.",1
"This has some stuffing and is not durable for dogs that are ""chewers"".",0
"Plants arrived in excellent condition and even though I paid for standard shipping, they upgraded it to expedited and it came 5 days earlier than expected! I am definitely buying from this seller again. Very green and healthy looking E. parvula. I ordered two packs and I got solid coverage for a 50 G aquarium. Granted I had some Eleocharis already planted in there, and it also depends on how much you're looking to plant. I'd say 5 of these would be good to appropriately cover an entire 50 gallon with nothing else in there.",1

Works Great!,1
"I have ordered 3,000 crickets. It took a while to get them delivered. Upon arrival at least 30% of the crickets were dead. Within 1 month another 40-50% died. I had a perfect set up for them and was feeding them very good and healthy food. They smelled terrible and were turning black and die for some reason. So over all I was able to feed to my reptiles only 20-30% of the crickets that I had received...They turned out to be extremely expensive for me.",0
"Smells great and now my pups coat is shiny! She has allergies so the vet recommended a shampoo that is soap free, with aloe and oatmeal. I am happy to find this product! Thank you!",1
Didn't think I needed a pump this big but glad I got it!  Always get at least one size bigger than you think you need. You won't regret it!,1

The African Grey and ringnecks love it!,1
"After only one month of use, my (small) dog was able to claw at the door and create a rip next to the zipper. She got her head stuck and couldn't get it out. Luckily we were home. I consider this a product hazard.",0

Did not seem to help my pet.,0
"The cat didn't like it as much as I thought she would, but then again, she's weird.",1
Don't do it. I read the reviews and did it. Shame on me. This thing's so flimsy I give it a couple days tops. it was already damaged when the package arrived because it wasn't packed very well. That's just a distributor not caring. The packing around the thing was so thin that just moving the package caused the Corners to be broke.  But of course the packings was only 1/4 inch thick or thinner just like the wood so damage is expected. Whole things only out of  1/4 inch thick wood so what do you want I'll update this after the dog decides to use it.,0
"The pictures look like it's better quality but for now it works. It's cute. It fits my dog as well & I will update my review again to let you guys know how it goes. I have a Dalmatian bullmastiff, she's about 85lbs and has an awkward thick neck/tummy area. I got a L and it fit perfectly with about an inch and half of extra slack. Another reason why it's 4 & not 5 stars is cause the strap is really smooth and came out of the latch part, I fixed it easily so hopefully it doesn't come out that easily when it's on my dog. Luckily my dog doesn't really pull anymore cause she's 7 years old but for those who do use it for that. :) hope this review helps.

EDIT: it's been about a month since she's gotten it, she doesn't really pull at all being that she's 7 years old & super calm all the time and the threading is already falling apart & the hook looks like it's going to rip off already. If you have dogs that pull, this will probably get you through a few days, maybe a week. It's a shame since it's so nice looking, and sturdy-looking. Even if your dog never pulls... You will probably get through a month like me (or less).",0
"We had a dwarf hammie that we thought would LOVE this cage, especially since SANTA had brought it to us. Well, the elves should be spanked. The wheel, as most people have said, ends up being a turd throwing MACHINE!! Think hammie baseball, the auto-matic turd thrower just like my boy's baseball throwing machine! Round and round the hammie goes, where the poop lands, we all do know..on the floor, in my coffee cup  on the dresser...ugh.

When hammie got old, he died. And, he died in the wheel, we thought he was sleeping, but since its hard to see inside the wheel colored as it is--he laid there til my daughter noticed no movement, and then we had a blood curdling SCREAM as she found her dead hammie in there. It was a mess getting the body out. So, turds can FLY out, but the dead hamsters are there to stay.

What a mess. Do not get this, its CRAP. Just like the turds in my coffee. Minus 5 stars if it were possible. (get a different brand altogether or a different type without the bars also--they escape through them).",0
Expensive but it is well worth it for keeping down the flys on our dairy. I will be buying again.,1
"We couldn't get the rubber edging to stay on.  Also, the bowls are very shallow, which means it is really easy to slosh water out when the bowl is full.  If you have an energetic puppy, these bowls are going to create a mess.",0

"I have three cats, our youngest recently developed urinary tract problems.  So I bought the urinary health pro-plan to give to all three cats.  Prior to this we fed purina one healthy weight management.  Each cat took one timid bite and then walked away.  I keep it out in case they change their mind, emptying and changing the bowl every other day.  It must taste terrible for my 3 cats to starve rather than eat it.  Had to get the Hills Urinary hairball formula which they all love.  Now I have 15lbs left of the pro plan left to feed the feral cats near my work.",0
"Grows nice plants without the hassle of CO2. Not every plant thrives with it, but once you find ones that do, they do well. Also keeps the algae under control. Been using it for years in all my planted tanks. The large size is a good value.",1
"These two items were exactly what I was looking for.  I have a Fluval gravel cleaner but the head is so narrow.  That one did not suck much up and the gravel does not really come back out the head.  This one is larger and shorter.  The top is narrower and is made of soft plastic.  It worked perfectly.  It would be nice if it had a control for the water.

The magnetic scrubber was bigger than expected but that is a good thing for me.  I have shrimp and snails that do the cleaning.  I used the scrubber for the glass shower door and walls.  It was great.  It has Velcro on the bottom to do the scrubbing.  I give it top recommendation because this set is great?  I received a discount in exchange for my honest review.  Quality exceeded my expectations",1
"Over the years we have owned a couple of these and this model by far has been the best.  Yes, it does get a little gummed up in the corners beside the rake, but in my experience owning 4 cats, this sure beats emptying litter boxes daily.  I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of daily litter box duty.",1
Kitty loves it.  Great value.,1
"The description is exaggerated and certainly isn't any of the "" AGGRESSIVE CHEWERS -  EXTRA DURABLE - Nearly Indestructible"" that they claim. My dog who is an aggressive chewer has already broken though one of the knots.",0
"Great product, very pleased.",1
"Look pretty hanging in the yard, but very cheap product. One broke the first time I rinsed it. They are also spill very easy as they don't hang evenly.",0
"Bought in August and went overkill - but it still broke, snapped when i pulled my dog back sharply to keep her out of harm's way.. I have a 30 dog and tthis model is made for up to 77 lb. Used for probably 4-5 short walks per week and it snapped yesterday. I hadn't seen any fraying prior to the break. Can't prove that it is a defect, so . . . I'm out the money.

These seem better quality when you look at them, but down spend all this money on something that's just going to break in a few months.",0
"It shakes terribly with my 20 lb pug while on flat, smooth surfaces. Not happy at all. Poor quality",0
My dog eats this stuff and it seems to have cured her of bad diarrhea. We were at our wits end trying to rid her of this problem. The vet prescribed vitamin B 12 shots. We went that route for a month--at 25 bucks a throw-- but no change. This dog food seems to have done the trick. Happy me.,1

"I bought this Kong toy  for my pitbull, she loves to chew on everything and i needed a toy that would last longer than a few days. I recommend  this toy to other pit bull owners or if your dog really likes to chew on things.
 I got the large size and its the perfect size for my dog. The receding bumps make it easy for a dog to grip and chew on.  $10 for a toy that lasts this long is an amazing deal! it comes in a variety of sizes, unlike most dog toys, its made for all sized dogs.

My dog loves the Kong toy, it has become her favorite toy. You can put food in it, you can play fetch and the dog can just chew on it to their hearts content! The red color is great because i can see it in the grass and so can the dog. We have had this toy for over a year! The Kong is the longest lasting toy i've ever bought. It has even been ran over by a car and its fine! it doesn't seem to be wearing at all.  The kong toy  is amazing!

We have bought rope toys, tennis balls no stuffed toys, and squeaky toys, none of them last long. One toy in particular i was disappointed in was the chuckit! balls. They only come in one size and I was worried my dog would swallow it! She had fun with it or a few minutes then she tore this supposedly indestructible toy, to pieces! The kong is really indestructible.
This really is the ultimate dog toy!",1
"These are great quality, and work very well. However, they are close to the size of a large rat than they are a mouse. My cats are scared of them, so I am now stuck with three ""rats"" that we are not able to use. I can't even give them away, because everyone has the same reaction (too scary looking to use as toys for their kitties). Seek other options for remote controlled cat toys, unless you cat is used to hunting animals larger than a mouse.",0
"I bought this crate and my dog loves it.  It is very nice and collapses easily, very durable and seems to last a long time.  I am 100 percent satisfied.",1
I personally don't mind it but my two birdys hate the living daylights out of it. one won't go near her cage when its up. I threw it out.,0
My favorite natural cat litter. I can't stand the way clay litter smells and how dusty it is.,1
There are barely any holes for drainage. It's going back.,0
This cage is awesome I set it up and my gizmo is very happy,1
Works most of the time to hide pills. That is saying something with my dog!,1
This was not as I thought it would be. The instructions are near impossible to understand. I thought I was getting a feeder that had a time for 5 different servings. No. The timer opens the feeder to reveal all five compartments at one time. Not useful to our needs.,0
"Not impressed with these at all. I ordered them based on other reviews and was surprised at how cheap they felt when they arrived--they're light and the blades stick badly and don't cut cleanly, even after adjusting the nut. They're going back. Save your money and get a pair of Millers Forge (the industry workhorse) instead...I should have known better!",0
One of my cat's favorite things and no longer available at PetsMart.,1
This ball was phenomenal while it lasted. It lasted all of an hour or two before she realized she could just tear the foam around it off when biting it. Theres nothing left to this ball. Would not purchase another one.,0

I had added to the bad behavior by giving him treats to have him quiet down, but i couldn't go on feeding him for every call I was on. It literally took one spray of pet corrector and now I just have to hold it up if at all and he will move away. Awesome + worked for my dog!",1
"This is the 3rd pet playpen we have bought. It will go to our puppies grandparents so he can stay safe at their house, also. We have the other two sets combined into one large area for our 10 week old Samoyed. He can already jump and chews everything, but not a mark on the playpen. No escapes, either. My 7 year old put it together, and loved that he could choose where the gate went. Our 4 year old can open and close the gate without problem. You do have to be careful that the door latches when you close it, but you can hear it when it closes properly. I was very concerned that a plastic system like this would look ""cheap"" as we are using it inside, but it doesn't. Just wish I would of had this as a play yard when my kids were babies!",1
This looks great. I love the double door. I can get my arm in to give her rewards while i control the other door. Its sturdy and didn't frighten puppy by shaking or moving,1

"Please do no buy Marshall Pet Products, which are sold by a company that breeds Beagles and Ferrets specifically for animal research.  Marshall BioResources, the parent company of Marshall Pet Products, has their own website below with the ads and photos of the Beagles and other pets they raise for torture.

[...]

As the owner of two loving Beagles, I became sick when I learned that a toy I had bought for them, was sold by a company that breeds others for torture.  The animals they raise and sell are destined for a life of agony as subjects of laboratory experiments.  Fortunately the Italian government closed the breeding factory in that country, but the company continues to breed Beagles for torture not only in China, Japan, South Korea, and India, but in North Rose, New York as well.

Just as dog fighting rings exploit other canine breeds by warping their protective instincts through abuse. Marshall Pet exploits Beagles because of their docile, loving, and trusting nature.  While some dog breeds might remove a researcher's hand after enough torture in a laboratory, Beagles are more likely to lick their torturer in hope of a reprieve.

[...]

Owners of fun loving Ferrets, wanting to provide a stimulating environment for their furry friends, should know that the company sells cute toys and everything needed to care for family pets, while selling Ferrets to laboratories for torture as well.  The company's website above proudly boasts of being a one-stop-shopping source for animals for torture.  In addition to Beagles and Ferrets, they advertise other hounds, mixed bring dogs, and miniature pigs they sell for experimentation.

My Beagles, Hunter and Meadow, ask that you not buy this product or others from Marshall Pet Products.

"There are a few problems with this item.  The sandpaper bands slips down while trying to use it on the pet's nail.  Even while trying to grind the nail for half a second, the motor will slow down and the band will slip off.  I just gave up using it and feel like it was money wasted.  I'm a very experienced dog owner and am good at using tools -- I'm going back to the Dremel.",0

"I bought this toy for my 15 week old puppy at a dog show and fortunately looked at the reviews on Amazon (thinking I would buy one for another dog) before he had played with it long (about three hours.) As another reviewer mentioned when I , alarmed, went to check out the damage he caused the antennae were gone and he had one of the knots which hold the small (choking size) rubber balls on the ""legs""  nearly undone. When I pulled the toy out of his pen the knot gave way and the little balls went flying. If I had not checked on him (because of the reviews) he could have easily swallowed parts of the toy aside from the antennae (which I assume he did eat.)
THANKS to those of you who posted warnings about this cute toy !! I add my own and remind everyone to supervise your dogs as they play with toys, especially new ones you are not familiar with.",0

"My 14 pound Pomeranian (6 years old) loves his new seat! Before getting this seat my little guy would sit and look worried as we rode along. He would not rest or sleep, just sit there looking miserable. Now with his new seat he relaxes and rides like a little king! I am glad I bought this larger seat even though he is only 14 pounds as it gives him more room to relax and not have to stay sitting up. By the way, the packaging this seat came in was very nice touch (zippered plastic bag).",1
The door itself is not bad but the hardware Is JUNK!  Two of the screw heads stripped during installation.  This made it impossible to remove and replace them.,0

it sprays onto my dog awesome and we haven't found a single tick or mosquito since starting to use it!,1
"This item did nothing to prevent our pugs from using the bathroom. Made from oils, it made them more curious to what the smell was than to prevent. I had high hopes for this product, but it failed to be effective.",0
"My cat loves this litter pan.  Previously preferred going outside, now solely uses this, easy to clean, extra large and long, litter box.  If you have several cats or a large cat, this is the box for you.",1
"OK We have been with out a dog for 2 years so I guess I forgot how expensive all of the accessories could be.  These leases were less than HALF of what they would have cost me to buy at the pet store PLUS they work great, as all of the Flexi leashes we have owned over the years have.",1
"Expensive and horrible for bulldogs in my opinion. My puppy had an allergic reaction to it and is still recovering. His hair broke off, he developed a rash, and had two small bald spot patches on his lower back. I immediately switched him over to Orijen 6 fish recommended by the vet, and Im hoping he does well on it. Were going on 3 weeks almost 4, I think the recovery is going to take awhile. I only fed him this crap for a couple of weeks, I cant wait for his coat to get back to normal.",0
The only non-living food my gecko will eat.,1
"I have 8 Cats and not a single one will eat. They all Sniffed it and walked away.  Its not uncommon for one or two of my cats to dislike a certain food, but this is the first time in the 22 years ive had my cats (oldest is 22, youngest is 9) that all 8 of them refuse to eat something.  5 of my cats are rescues and will usually eat anything, but not this. I did notice that it has a very unusual odor and color.  The flavor is listed as tuna and salmon - yet this smells NOTHING like tuna or salmon or anything from the sea. Its also very, very dark brown - almost black and ive NEVER seen black tuna or salmon.
All of my cats love tuna and salmon, yet are repulsed by this and since It doesn't look or smell like seafood, I really question the ingredients or the processing or both.",0
"My ""Puddy"" loves it!",1
First One lasted about a year and then had to replace but the dogs love their beds.,1
"used it on my cat- she's very long hair, so I figured for the large cat would be best (she's about 7 lbs). Used 3 treatments about 2 weeks apart...and I'm STILL seeing fleas on her when I brush her and this morning there was one on my arm! Its as if this stuff doesn't work at all.",0
I have 4 dogs and never seem to have enough of this.,1
"This harness was for a 10 lb. 6 mo. old kitten.  It fit him beautifully.  He did get out of it once, because I hadn't put it on him right.  I'm giving it a 1 star, for 1 reason.  The snap (latch, whatever it's called) is located right behind the right leg, which irritated him when he walked.  So, he wouldn't walk, but instead crawled.  It wasn't too tight and it was on correctly.  I took it off of him after several hours and tried it the next day, and the day after.  He would repeat the crawling.  I purchased a harness that has the snaps on top.  No problem.",0
"This toy is awesome! It has a great combination of stuffed animal and rope toy.... to make it even better, there is a squeaker inside! My puppy loves it and Im amazed how well it has held up! Very great quality and size. I have a Bloodhound puppy.",1
"I absolutely love this collar for my dog.  The best thing for me is the softness, which I haven't been able to find in any other collar. My dogs skin tends to get sensitive around where his collar sits, but we haven't had that problem with this one.  Even though it is soft, there is no strength lost in it as it holds up really well to pulling.  The clasp is firm so the collar stays on despite having a rambunctious dog who often gets out of his collars, and he has not gotten out of this one yet.  It is adjustable to size so it can fit a large variety of dogs.  I will say that it was a bit tedious to adjust the collar to the correct length because of the small strap that holds the two sides together, but once it was adjusted it hasn't moved.  This is also a great value for the quality of this collar.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I plan to buy a second one for my other dog.",1
Palm oil is in this! As an animal lover this additive destroys any good it might do for my dog. Avoid any products with palm oil in it.,0
"When we have started giving this supplement to our pet we noticed an improvement regarding the number of times she stretches herself, so it seems to be working, and she really enjoys these tablets, it is like treat for her. I just don't like the price, and the tablets dissolve themselves inside the container with a lot of powder left inside, probably due to shacking during transportation.",1
"I ordered this two pack in yellow, but I received one pink and one blue. Not pleased, but not worth sending back. However, I gave the toys to the dogs this morning, and they were gutted by nightfall.",0
"I purchased this for two reasons.  One to slow down my dog's eating and to have a dog bowl that did not move around.  Well he is eating a bit slower, not much though and he ends up in the other room chasing the bowl around on the tile floor.",0
This is the worst investment I have ever made. My cats hate it. I have mess around the box. I will be broke in months buying the litter and pads I have to use . I wish to get a refund. I can not return it. If u know a way let me know. First really bad item I have bought through Amazon.,1
"We only give our dog one toy at a time. When that one gets ripped up and squeaker taken out, then it's time for a new toy. Most toys I've purchased last less than an hour. This one is still intact after 1 month. In my book, that's a keeper and worth every penny. I bought her the medium size one and it's perfect.

I will update when she finally takes out the squeaker.

UPDATE: She was able to get the squeaker out the end of May, so 3 months is pretty good.",1
Cats loved it for about 2 weeks then vomiting and litter box issues like crazy. Took them both to the vet he suggested to take them off the food and sure enough everything was fine again. I horrified to think what was in there. I ordered a few cases at a time when they were on sale so I have plenty to spare and may be taking legal action. Avoid this product!,0
Product is very durable. My 11 month old pup has destroyed other so called toys for Power Chewers. Do not walk bare foot! Spines are very painful!,0
"I tried this product at the recommendation of my vet because my dog has had some recurring UTIs as well as IBS. After using for over a month the PH levels in her urine only changed slightly, but since she hasn't had any more infections I will keep her on the product for a while longer.  I think it is a great supplement and she seems to lap it up just fine!",1
Arrived on time and without issue. The batteries are not very good and didn't last any time at all and was hardly used but they didn't hold up charge at all.,0
"This is complete junk, cheaply made and electrocuted my dog in the water. I shouldve believed in all the 1 stars reviews but thought the price was right and it overall it was 4 stars. I definitely regret doing this to my dog as my dog is now completely afraid of getting in the water with my kids as he didn't know why he was shocked. The unit is not waterproof as stated in the description and afterwards it just kept vibrating and shocking even after getting it off my dog as it shocked me too in the process. Horrible product and complete JUNK! DO NOT BUY THIS!",0
"My rats LOVE this wheel!  It gets used all night and we can hardly hear it at all.  The wheel itself just is a whisper, the noise comes when the royal rattnesses run it out of position in their large cage, so then it taps a bit on the cage bottom.  It's quieter if it's against the cage wall.  Worth every penny!",1
"i have a ryukin fancy goldfish that was having severe swim bladder issues. a couple hours after each feeding he would start swimming upside down and flying around the tank with no control. frozen peas only alleviated the problem temporarily.
this food has him working correctly.",1
"Though our dog loved these in the past, for some reason she had no interest in these this time.",0
"Tl;dr: It leaked and I returned it. I really wanted to like this because my cat loves to play with water. The pump was so quiet I could barely hear it, and the rippling water looked cool, but my cat didn't want to drink from it. I tried taking away her usual water bowl but to no avail. She liked looking at the water, but she didn't like how the moving water hit her on the nose. And, as I said before, the place where the cord attaches to the back of the bowl is not watertight and would leak. Some modifications with a glue gun might be able to seal it, or maybe I got a defective unit, but I didn't want to bother because my cat didn't like it anyway.",0
My dog smells amazing after using this! Occasionally she gets some fleas and Natural Chemistry seems to help. I mainly buy it for the smell though. I get a lot of compliments on how good she smells and the scent of the shampoo sticks around for a long time.,1
I bough this for my toy poodle. The comb will not pass through a poodles curly hair. It just get entangled. This might work better on a dog with soft straight hair but not a poodle.,0
"We've used Frontline regular or Advantage on our cats for years with no problems. We recently bought Frontline Plus at a big-box store. Soon after applying, both cats became ill and began acting strangely, as though they were having neurological problems. Pretty scary. In hindsight, I wish I'd taken them to the vet. Fortunately, they recovered after ~24 hours. I can only hope the toxins didn't cause any permanent damage. I'm now back to using Advantage, as I no longer trust Frontline in any form.",0
"I have two small maltese and they ate these right up, but vomited afterwards and had blue-ish runny bowels the next day. Something in these treats didn't agree with them. My dog's typically love Blue Buffalo treats and I have never had an issue in the past. This is the first time I tried the dental bones - I usually give them the jerky treats. I still recommend Blue Buffalo, just won't be buying these again.",0
"Gets wet quickly and stays wet! The smell from the urine is also much stronger with the pure comfort bedding. It may be cheaper than Carefresh, but requires more frequent changing.",0
"Just what I needed when I walk my canine friends instead of having my phone, treats and bags stuck in my pockets!!",1
"I just love these! It's so much nicer to not have to worry about where my dogs are while I'm driving! I am on a budget so I liked the price, and they work really well for both my dogs. A major bonus that the dogs like them as well! I can trust that they're safe, and they're  very easy to use. Should have bought them years ago!",1
"I needed something for cats, which is what I had searched for. Maybe I misread something, but when I got it, it states for dogs only. Now I'm basically stuck with it because the cost to return isn't worth bothering with it.",0
"I had to return this because my cat was petrified by it. It made her MUCH more upset, not less.",0
"Adorable. I bought a size large for my Shih Tzu, which is too big, but my plan was to wash/dry it to shrink a little bit. Worked. Now it fits perfectly, especially when her hair is longer between groomings.",1
"Found larva & moths in our first bag of Beyond Dog Food.
Not something I appreciate feeding my dogs.
Going back to our original brand...Blue Wilderness.
More expensive, but never had this problem with their products!",0
"I have an earlier remote and this is the only replacement collar for it. My old collar quit working and the original only had 8 levels of stimulation. The new collar has more so you only get minor stimulation if you use the new collar with the original remote. My dog Koda has figured this out and ignores it completely. If you don't have the brand new system, DO NOT buy this collar as a second or replacement. Short of that it is a nice collar that I paid a lot of money for that does not work.",0
What a great value.,1
"After I finally got them they were so small my fish ate them the same day..would have never bought them if I had known that.,expensive fish food..contacted seller..never heard back",0
"Well made and looks good, but the slip lock is hard to move (too stiff). Hopefully it will loosen up with time.",1
runs small!,0
I had high hopes for this . My Dog loved it.  But it only lasted a few days before it was completely torn apart.,0
"I didn't see a difference for my pup during our cold walks.  The product didn't bother her, but I don't think did anything.  Oh well.....",0
I read the mixed reviews on here and decided to go ahead and try it anyway. And boy was that a mistake! As soon as I opened the bag the smell made me nauseous it has a weird odor to it. But since I had nothing else to use I used this. My guinea pig wasn't too happy either she kept sneezing. After a few days the smell got worse. It is pretty but not worth your money. Get a different bedding!,0
"I bought this for a toad house in my toad habitat.  It is awesome for this purpose.  Actually, many little creatures can take refuge inside it outdoors.",1
"My cat who eats everything will not even LICK this food! He is three years old and I've had him his whole life. I'm a college student so some months I'll have more money than the last so the quality of his food varies from $10 up to as much as $50 and he has never hesitated between brands until now. I'm very displeased and will not be ordering this again. Weird fact too, I left the food outside for the neighborhood cats to eat but it stayed out there for a few days and no flies would even get in it. Very strange. I do not suggest spending money on this.",0
"I have two indoor cats. One accidentally got out and within 24 hours I was cleaning everything and ordering this product. Unfortunately, little did I know, it does not offer any prevention. It killed the fleas on them, but did not prevent any that might have snuck by the vacuum. I've wasted money and now have to find another solution.
Would not reccommend.",0
This stuff works and fast i was skeptical buying it but willing to try it in order to give my dogs some relief from kennel cough.  In less than 3 days all 4 of my dogs wer cough free could not be happier would recommend to anyone,1
The product works exactly as stated but I have 2 Rottweilers so they may need a stronger reminder not to bark.,1
beautiful and looks just like the picture.  Thank you!  Quick shipment.,1
"The toothpaste itself is wonderful!  I was sad when the company briefly discontinued it;  I could not find it on their website listed as a product.  My dog loves this toothpaste.  I think it is the only reason he allows me to brush is teeth.  It is hard to find toothpaste for dogs that is not poultry or beef flavored.  If I wanted my dog's breath to smell like he just finished eating, I would not brush his teeth at all.  So glad Virbac makes a mint flavored toothpaste that my dog likes.",1
"Ordered the warm blood size, fits my draft TB cross .",1
"My Brother's Christmas gift from us all was a Basset Hound puppy, this collar was perfect and was the icing to the cake :)",1
"I bought the stainless steel bone shaped dog tag. Engraving on shiny surface was pale brown, not black as shown and hard to read.  Looks like much of the engraving ""came off"" on heavy black tape they used to tape tag to paper inside small standard letter or greeting card envelope they used to send. Quality not even as good as the self serve kiosk in Petsmart, etc.  I have to return to get refund and pay postage to do so.  Do not recommend product.",0
They were very nice boots but my dog would not walk with them on and only wanted to bite them off. Sizing was accurate.,0
The charge would only last a hour,0
"Wire gauge is thin for a big dog. My dog is a chewer and he bent the crap out of the door.

Edit: This crate lasted a little over a week. Won't buy from Precision again.",0
"It is a very nice leash, but when I received it was actually kinda dirty...like it may have been used. Very odd.",1
It doesn't stay buckled it slides out and falls off,0
I bought them for my little dog who can't have hard treats and they're hard as a rock,0
"I like it, but the litter does stick to the scoop so it does need to be washed. The no stick advertising is a lie. Otherwise, its well made and heavy which makes it faster and much easier to use in a big litter box. I would recoomend.",1
"These turned out to be better then expected.  My puppy loves them.  They are softer to the touch then they may look in the picture.  They feel almost like velvet.  Very fun toy to have around to play with your dog.  Also a very great price, given that if you buy a dog toy in the store, it'll cost you this much for one toy, let alone getting all three.  I definitely would buy this again.  It also came to my house a lot earlier then expected which was an extra bonus.  It was supposed to be here on Monday but it got here on Friday instead.  Love these!!!",1
My dogs love it,1
Good product,1
"The crate was tough and strong in every way, except for the latches, which are flimsy compared to the rest of the crate. My Australian Shepard was able to get them opened very quickly. I got some connecter links hoping that they would stabilize the latches, but she panicked in a thunderstorm and ended up cutting her mouth badly on the door, breaking some teeth and needing $1200 worth of dental surgery. Also she chewed on the Pro Select sign on the front of the crate and it was covered in blood when I found her. I am very disappointed, especially considering the trauma she went through, and the large amount of money I wasted.",0
Love this product. ... use it daily for pain  from a failed  knee replacement. ...,1
"works good, need to use pliers to close the s hooks or the will nocked off and lost",1
This is the spray our dog groomer uses and it has a great scent.  I've been looking for it a while now and glad I found it.,1
Worked perfectly for my long road trip with my dog.,1
Buyer be ware. This nearly $150 feeder isn't for every pet. If it doesn't work for your pet the return warranty is crazy. The company is not going to help you except to recommend you starve your animal until the animal gets it if it doesn't work for them. I wish I could do 0 stars from this unhappy consumer.,0
didn't fit my dog,0
"returned to seller, not the correct size or style as described or pictured.... the original photo was different than photo posted later! annoying",0
"I bought this after seeing my 12-year-old cat sitting on the heat registers around the house (more so this winter than before), and after reading the reviews. Once I picked her up and put her in the bed, she jumped out, and then a minute later she climbed back in ... and since then spends many hours of the day and all night most nights curled up in the bed. She fits in it well, with room to spare, at 10.5 lbs. She loves it, and was the best buy for her!",1
This is just gravel. It doesn't absorb. I swear I used this brand before and it worked fine. I've never seen litter this grainy. This product just leaves a mess.,0
My girl loves her Whimzees!,1
"A lot smaller than exspected. Wont be able to house a full grown male rat let alone two. That goodness mine are babies.. good quality, but not good space. Would do well for a hamster.",0
Was partially brown when I received it Turned totally brown and died - definitely not worth the money!,0
Still working great!,1
"I was looking for an affordable leather collar for my pug mix who has issues with cloth/polyester collars chafing his neck. I originally ordered the mint green 11 in. thinking this would be plenty big for him (he is 18 lb and usually a S in collars). It happened to arrive in the wrong color (regular blue) and was a tad snug on the loosest hole. So when contacting customer service (who were very prompt and fixed the issue quickly and easily, might I add!) about getting a replacement for the correct color, I went ahead and sized up to the 13 in. This size fits him tight enough on the first hole but is a tad loose. Hes been wearing it for over a month now and overall, the quality is great and the leather has prevented any skin irritation on the neck allowing his fur to grow back. My biggest recommendation would be to size up to better avoid having to deal with exchanges.",1
Good product,1
"My cat is not at all impressed by this mat. I thought he would just love it, so I got it for him. He loves to scratch sisal things. He has a sisal flat floor post that is his favorite scratching object. He also likes to scratch the carpet under my bedroom door. So he's not really a vertical scratcher. I really thought this would be a hit with him. I put it in one of his favorite spots and he has simply ignored it for the last three weeks. I tried moving it to a different place, tried playing with him on it, running him across it while playing with him, everything I can think of. He just wants nothing to do with it. We have other fabric crinkle mats that he enjoys, but this one is a bust for him.",0
"My dogs love Benny Bully's so I thought I would try this one with apple. The delivery package was soft sided and damaged. The actual product looked more like crumbs than pieces. On a good note, the pieces I salvaged the dogs enjoyed.",0
Worst training pads ever purchased. Very thin.,0
"I have two of these harnesses for my dogs.  In both cases, the harness was inadvertently left on them alone.  In both cases, the dog did bite out of them and the company (Wiggles, Wags, & Whiskers) replaced the harness without question.  The harness itself works well.  I prefer it for them as the dogs respond more quickly to a pull on their chest over the typical neck collar.  I have to admit that I do not use both rings very often as the ring between the shoulder blades works very well alone but the harness did come with a leash that can attach to the front of their chest and between the shoulder blades.  When I used the harness in that setup, the dogs did not leave my side at all.",1
"It just sits there and doesn't do anything! I thought it would help absorb bad/strong odors, at least the description claims that's what it's supposed to do.",0
The one I received is nothing like the one pictured. When screwed into the ground the swivel is touching the dirt so it's useless,0
Great quality little sweater!!!,1
"I am putting this table together but two pieces are defective, and can not figure out how to ask for just those two pieces to be replaced. I love the pet house and it seems very well packaged and would be a beautiful piece of furniture however, it is half put together in my living room and I do not want to take it apart as I know that will compromise the integrity of the piece . Can someone please tell me how to get just those two pieces? I need the floor (D) as the hole the door sits in is cracked. I also need the shelf (C) as it is warped and I am unable to tighten the screws to hold it solid. Thank you, Robin Olson",0
Better than I expected amd my cat loves it!,1
On our 2nd walk our 7mo old puppy chewed through the front the strap in under 2 mins. On our 1st walk the plastic pc the lease attaches to broke because the puppy was pulling while walking so he was able to run free. This product was not worth the money.,0
"The price on these was terrific.  I actually bought these for my daughter's birthday party favors (tea party - dormouse), but I had a few left for my cats.  One of my cats isn't affected by catnip, but nevertheless, she loves the mice.  She has adopted a white one as her baby/plaything.  My other cat loves catnip, and he pretty much adopts any mouse that's within arm reach.  He'll groom them til they're gone.",1
"This is the 4th bag I have bought. My pup LOVES them!!!! I like the pumpkin smell, too. These don't stink up the room when he chews on them like other bones tend to do. He begs to eat these, so he must like them!",1
"Worst ever!
The test liquid went bad. Its dark brown, and it should be blue!",0
"I don't know if they've changed the formula or what, but this litter only controls odor for a few days and then requires a complete change out, even with daily scooping. It used to last up to two weeks in my two-cat household. Also, the clumping is not very good anymore. Very disappointed.",0
"I received this product and I got it to work the first time by pressing buttons 1 and 2. Then it stopped working! I removed the batteries and let them sit for a while. Later in the day, I inserted the batteries back into the unit and it worked again but not for long.

This has been my experience with this product but I must say it was effective when the unit was functional. This product is made of cheap plastic and the overall feel is it is rubbish. I really regret getting this.",0
"We saw this at a local pet store for $20 and it seemed to be quality and built to last.  We were excited when we found it for less on Amazon. Our lab was able to rip the ear of within minutes, so it wasn't so quality after all.  Bummer.",0
"I was looking for a more natural approach to treating my husky's diarrhea, which seems to be due to a very sensitive stomach. The doctor has been prescribing metronidazole and tylan, but I was hoping to provide a better flora for his stomach. I originally bought this through an online vet med store, but found it through Amazon much cheaper. It works wonders. I always keep a big syringe on hand. I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking to help their dog with a less disruptive course of treatment.",1
Can collapse on your dog if left alone. Do not recommend,0
When I ordered this I wasn't sure if it would fit the cat tree that we had. Luckily it does and I couldn't be happier. As soon as we put it in the cat used it and seem to like it. It holds perfect and doesn't slide,1
Just like any other carpet cleaning solution.,1
Thank you,1
"I realize our weather hindered a timely delivery, our weather is too hot for shipping during hot temps-a lot of the year in Louisiana; when finally shipped we received our order of 10-5 red, 5 yellow-7 were alive to start then over the next week we lost all but 1. Placing another order just didn't seem to make sense. Ordering live dwarf shrimp just isn't something we feel comfortable doing again at this time.
The term 'dwarf' is very true, these are in the 1/4 to 1/2 inch long probably.",0
This was like it was made for a mouse house .It was a waste of  money!,0
"Heats mostly on the bottom, very little on top surface.  I returned it for a new one, which did exactly the same thing. bought one a  year ago and it heated on top, not a tremendous  amount, but enough that my cat liked it. It was OK for places where the Winter is mild. But when I took out the year old heating pad, it no longer worked. Poor cat,  no warm perch.
  Haven't found another brand. Has anyone? Thanks.",0
"It was a large bag for the price, but the jerky was incredibly dry, especially compared to the few bags I've bought from local stores.",0
Does not work on my greyhound.,0
My dog loves these bones,1
"It's one of those products that sounds good on paper and works ok for a short time, and then it's all downhill after that and you're wondering why you bought into it. My kittens don't mind using it when it's very clean, but after 2-3 uses it gets very dirty and you can't clean it like a normal litter box. It doesn't hide the poop like regular litter, so the cats think it's always dirty. Also, I constantly have to clean the rake because there's always poop getting stuck to it. The refill trays get expensive quickly, especially if more than 1 cat is using it.

It also gets smelly, if not more so than a regular litter box. So overall, it's more hassle than it's worth. Neat idea, but not there yet.",0
"My dog is stylin' in this sweater. It has sharp lines and looks really snazzy, and the front sleeves make it a bit warmer than sweaters with only holes for the legs.  As with other Blueberry pet sweaters, it is heavy and well made. I wish, though, that Blueberry made an 18"" size because the 16"" is a tad too small for my 32-lb terrier.",1
"We got the KONG toy today for my dog and he is a smaller medium sized dog and in under 10 minuets he has already chewed through more than half of it only a part of the toy remains... So, now I had to take it from him now that it is a choking hazzared... I have only 1 KONG toy that has worked for him and this is far from it.",0
"Really disappointed in the quality of this bed.  Mine arrived today with two areas of unsewn seams on the underside. I was heading out on a trip with my dog and bought this to put in the bottom of her carrier. Now I have to make time to repair it. Thanks for nothing, MidWest.",0
The design looks cool and sounds great in theory but when we got the package and put it together the pump does not work so we basically have a big water dish.,0
I have used these since day 1 with my bird and they have been awesome. Makes cleaning the cage(s) so much easier! I was going through multiple rolls of paper towel before I found these. I can put them on his play stations as well as in his carrier to keep things clean and dry all the time. Happy bird!,1
not correct colors of gay rainbow,0
Horrible rubber smell.,0
Since rescuing our second dog 6 months ago its been a challenge for me to walk both dogs by myself. I would tie the smaller one to my belt and hold the bigger one and they were still getting tangled when crossing each other and zig zagging. Now I have confidence in walking them by myself and have more control. It is also made very well and is strong. My bigger dog is 60 lbs and smaller one is 30 and its awesome for both. Wish I had gotten this 6 months ago. No joke!!!,1
"MY CAVALIER KING CHARLES IS 7 AND A BIT OVERWEIGHT, I MIX THIS WITH THE WELLNESS SENIOR DRY AND HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH HIS DINNER.  HE EVER LOST SOME WEIGHT.  MY VET RECOMMENDS THIS PRODUCT TOO",1

"I use this soap on my Chippewa 1901 boots. Doesn't darken the leather very much and moisturizes the leather very well. I use a small Kiwi brush; dip the brush in water, lightly rub the tip of the brushes in the soap while wet, then rub down the boot. Wipe of excess. Good to go! The container is huge. It'll take me years to go through.",1
Worth the price.,1
"I wanted this to feed meals to my toy poodle puppy. Although the dimensions are given, it'a not until you can put your hands on something that you can get a true feel for the size. It's a bit tall and heavy for my puppy right now. An extra small version would be better. Just something to consider when considering the size. There are two ways to control the amount of kibble that can come out at a time: an outside hole with sliding opening and a similar one on the inside. I anticipate that he will be able to access his food easily even at the most challenging level at some point, but it will still make a good interactive toy.",1
This is my grand dog's favorite toy. I can't find them is stores anymore.,1
"I normally feed a quality canned food, but I was going away for a week so I was seeking a quality dry food for the cat to eat during this time. I switched the cat over by mixing the old and new foods in increasing ratios for a week prior (this was not a sudden food change). Things seemed alright at first, but after on 100% of this dry food, the cat developed loose, bloody, horrid smelling stools. However, I think this cat may have a fish allergy, so it might be the herring in this food. After switching the cat back to the canned food, the stools went back to being their normal firm and virtually odorless within a couple days. Also the cat seemed to start getting fat eating this dry food, whereas she maintains a fairly normal weight when free fed the quality canned food.",0
Another Blue Buffalo Fave for my best bud!,1
"I might have just bought a size too big for our dog, but they would NOT stay on at all and kept slipping off her tail. The tail hole was also too low and when she went to sit/lay anywhere she would leak out the tail hole.",0
They do what there suppose to. I would recommend this product because the are durable and won't leak or rip.,1
My dog loves these and the price was good so I bought two bags,1
We love this harness and bought it in different colors for both our dogs.  It's soft and they don't seem to mind wearing them.  It's easy to just pop it over their head and click them in.  Make sure you measure you dogs head so you know it will slide over their head when you put it on.,1
very nice would buy again,1
Always love Kong',1
"Don't waste your money.  This ONLY includes the tape, not the lead.  If you want both, it will cost you over $35.  Description is not clear.  Huge disappointment!",0
Didn't like it because there were no instructions or diagrams to show you how to put it on the dog.  I sent a message to the seller but they had nothing to offer.,0
"Great harness. This is the only thing that keeps our pit bull in line. She's torn up or chewed through all the others. Only issue is the buckle is huge and kind of hard to buckle without pinching yourself (or, god forbid!) the dog's skin.",1
"My shihtzu-poodle absolutely loves this. He had a minor health issue nine months ago at the tender age of nine and a half, and the vet suggested I switch him to grain-free food. He'd never eaten grain-free in his life. When I bought this first in a pet store, the sales lady strongly recommended I mix it with yummy foods with gravies etc to get him to eat it. And she sadly reminded me that going grain free is like giving up fun, sinful food and going vegan. And she pointed out to me that even if he slows down his eating a bit, eventually he will eat it when he is hungry.

The clincher was when she said that they guarantee their product, and if he's not eating it, I could bring it back for a full refund. So with nothing to lose, I brought it home and mixed it with some of the most bland looking grain free canned food with gravy, and he actually ate it. (Even though I felt sad for him). Next day, I decided to try him with this dry food alone. HE ATE THE WHOLE THING. (Much better without mixing it with other stuff, apparently).

He now has a better appetite than he's ever had in his whole life, and his diet is way better with this.

I only wish they had a choice of flavors for small breeds. There seem to be so many fun flavors for large dogs. Small dogs are people too, Blue Buffalo company!  Make some more flavors for small breeds so my little Boogieman can actually have a choice of menu options!",1

"Our dog fights the nose strap.  If you're dog is fine with that, I'm sure it would work well for you.",0
Not to be used to tie out a dog. Our dog slipped out of the collar on the second use. The buckle is cheaply made and does not hold.,0
Sleeves had to be rolled up but otherwise perfect.,1

made for children and apply it. Or I'll use human hair dye...last time that worked great then I tried this. Not worth it at all!!,0
Excellent energy giving dog food! Real food not processed.,1
"I've had this door installed for about a week. My dog is already doggie door trained. She's a pretty intelligent client. However, even an intelligent dog and an adult human (that has read over and over the instruction manual) can have a hard time figuring out the automatic setting on this door. And I finally figured out why we were having such difficultly- the door only works when it wants to. The sensor isn't nearly powerful enough (on any range setting). My dog is pretty low to the ground and the key only seems to work when I point it directly at the door. Needless to say, I haven't quite trained my dog to turn and position the key just right in relation to the door- lacking thumbs and all, it would be kind of difficult for her.

Also when it does register, the door only stays unlocked for a few seconds before it locks again and resets. So if you're dog doesn't make it out of the door in time, they have to stand there for 10 seconds until the door registers the key again. I've tried to explain this to my dog, but I don't think she gets it. She just scratches on the door and when it doesn't open, pisses on the carpet.

If your dog does manage to point the key at the right angle and moves fast enough to get out of the door before it closes- the door can still get stuck in the open position. If the door is open when it attempts to lock it just freezes where ever it happens to be. Letting my cats out and defeating the purpose of having an automatic dog door in the first place. If I didn't care what animals got in or out of my house I would have bought a cheap flappy door or cut a random hole in the wall for free.

In my opinion, PetSafe has to step it up before anyone else bothers to install this door. Just house train your dog, pay a pet sitter, take your dog to work with you, or just don`t get a dog at all. All of these options are better than buying this door.

PetSafe: Just because your's is the only product on the market doesn't give you the right to suck.",0
The cat likes it.,1
Did not come with a chart.,0
"I was also pleased to have a spare should Buddy lose the one he's wearing. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because I don't care for the clasp. There is nothing wrong with it, but it's just about impossible to get off with one hand. Others may have no intention to remove it. Update: I had the tag on Buddy for about 6 months before the clasp wore through the tag. The edge of the tag and the hole for the clasp is not very thick. Cheap plastic with a very thin piece of metal(aluminum?) sandwiched in between. You can see in the picture that the hole is almost to the edge of the tag, not enough to take much wear and tear. My dog is a 6lb Yorkie and it wore through with him just playing in the yard and laying in his bed. When he is working he is walking and all I figure is it wears through from flopping around. I really liked the tags, wish they were more durable. I expected one to last a little more than a couple months.",0
"I have two strong pullers and have used these for weeks, so far so good on the quality. These are the perfect length.  Love the cushioned handle.",1
Received in 2 days and product was as described and fit perfectly. Great value.,1

"This filter has always been noisy, unlike my previous Tetra air pump for 20 gallons. I don't use it at all.",0
"Very simple to use, my pre teen girls use it to clean up after the dog. I used it for the first time after this winter and it does a great job of getting the broken down stuff that's been there all winter. I was really surprised by that. The teeth on the front of it do a great job at getting under the grass and lifting the stuff into the scoop. Great thing about it is that you don't have to use their bags. It does come with some, but they are kind of small, at least for my lab. I have been using regular plastic grocery bags, works great, and has handles. My only complaint is with the 2 foot handle, it's ok if you are 3' to 4' tall, but your back will get tired. The threading for the handle is the same as a painters pole. So I use my telescoping painters pole and now I don't have to bend over at all. If I would have known that a painters pole worked, then I would have just order the Poobagger without the 2' handle.",1
Too small. I measured my dog's neck & bought according to size but way too small Better luck next time,0

Works as advertised!!,1
great for my cats also.  I simply adjusted for the weight difference after reading several reviews and no more worms in my dog or cats.  Thank you for the great deal.,1
Great cat toy- being used often,1
"I love it!!! I just wish my dogs did to. I have 2 beagles and they can't stand the noise. Even the slow setting is loud, they just freak out. Nice product though. I tried leaving it on in room for a few hours. They still bounce off the walls!!! Oh-well. It is a great idea though. I bet labs and bigger dogs don't mind at all. Has severall hole setting sizes for all size dogs nails. Grinding stones/paper. Nice product. Definitely buy if ya have a bigger dog!! Not $$$$ either.",1

Good price compared to Petsmart.,1
Use it once a month on the fish tank with no issue. Works great!,1
This was a good item until the remote when insane one day and started shocking the heck out my dog. We couldn't  figure out what was going on until we started hearing it zapping. We never used the shock option on our dog so we didn't know it was doing that. We only ever use the vibration option. New batteries never stopped it from zapping as well. My poor puppy!,0
I LOVE HAVING TWO HANDLES! I'll never want any other type of leash! My dog is good on this leash but has a problem with wanting to jump up on people when they pass by. That's when the other handle comes in handy to gain control.,1
I was happy with how quick my order arrived. I used the little chap stick-like tube on my dog's nose for the first time and it was very easy to apply! Great company!,1
"This stuff is a life saver! My pitbull has some joint issues and this has helped so much. Before after he would play outside he would limp for days everytime.

Great price and product.,1
"I usually order the Fresh Patch dog lawn (which I love and lasts for weeks and does not stink), but I thought I'd try this brand since the box is bigger. What a waste. The stench was unbearable after one week. I don't know if they use a different kind of grass with a different root system, but it does NOT lock the smell in like Fresh Patch. What a mistake.",0
not as bright as the picture! and super tiny!,0
"This is my 3rd pet hammock from various companies. I bought this to replace a SolvIt hammock that just didn't fit properly witha  few other issues. The fit on this was better but not perfect as it sagged off of the back seat and the anchors were the reason. To properly secure the hammock using the anchors pulled the back portion down exposing a large enough area of the back seat resulting in the major problem. I was living with the sagging but after a trip to the local dam to let my dog, a neighbors dog and a foster dog (roughly 200lbs of dog) one of the clasps on the back headrest broke now rendering the hammock utterly useless. It is not unusual for me to have multiple dogs and the other 2 hammocks I purchased did not have an issue with clasps breaking.",0
I ordered this pen to get my puppy outside. Well I will say if I knew the quality of this product I would NOT have ordered it. The sewing on the doors were very poor and I had to resew them. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!!! It was poorly made!!!,0

This is my favorite shirt to put on her she so cute in it. Love this shirt so worth it.,1
"I like the idea of the filtration system for the dogs water because my husky likes to stick his dirty feet in the water bowl, but the pump is not strong enough to pump much water through the filter so the dirt just collects at the bottom still and completely negates any purpose of having the filter in the first place.
That being said, it's not even the worst part  for me. The worste part is that there is no screen of filter on the pump, so it just pumps what ever is in the bowl through it (or tries to, it's really a weak pump) and with two big hairy dogs it gets clogged ALL OF THE TIME. Which brings me to the third thing I don't like about it.
It is kind of a process to take it apart and clean it. It really is a pain to get all of the hair and dirt out of all the nooks and crannies in this thing.",0
"This never made it to my feral kitty.  As with many other reviewers experience....the heating pad did not work. You are instructed to plug in the pad, put some weight in it and wait 20 minutes..I did that. Nothing happened in 20 min, 60 min or 3 hours.  Even if it had heated up I have doubts about how well this would have served my purpose..I wanted to keep an aging feral cat as warm and comfortable as possible in these cold winters..but I don't think this would have served the purpose for several reasons: Firstly, it is very lightweight and unless I put something in the smallish interior to hold it down, it would blow away in our winter winds--and this is on the porch..it definitely needs to be on a porch or in a garage and while it would have offered some shelter, it really isn't as insulated as needs to be for Midwest below temp nights..basically foam covered with waterresistat heavy nylon type material. The cord length is fine, but the spiral metal 'spring like' protection would corrode soon I fear.  I have converted an old coleman cooler to a shelter and it is much more suitable..I'll just look for  heat sourse.",0
"My dog didn't even have this on for a week and the webbed nylon started unraveling. Very POOR quality, would not recommend!",0

"Love how they are safe for the digestive track in dogs, unlike rawhides.. The regular ones smell good, (chicken n vegetable chews) (this flavor stinks bad), they don't leave a mess anywhere unlike this flavor will stain n stink up your house.

Will I keep buying them ( the other flavor) ( ninth month in a row) - heck yeah- Liberty enjoys them WAY to much not to. At this point she insists every package delivered to me is HER package, the UPS man is rewarded by a furry, four legged, 120#, bouncing, licking lover everytime he shows up. ",0

Not too long or too short! Perfect length for my puppy's Puppia Vixen harness.,1
It works! My dog had a very bad barking problem for a long time and this collar stopped the barking within a hour. My dog doesnt bark at all with it on and barely barks with it off. There was a starnge extra electrical part that came with the collar that I have no idea what its for. There is no explanation for the spare part in the instruction booklet.,1
I like clothes!,1
Wonderful,1
"One of my cats loved this toy from day one, the other has never been interested in the manual laser toy.  He loses the light sometimes, but quickly learned the noise it makes means that the light has moved, so he goes searching for it.  The other kitty started joining in after a few days.  With the manual toy, our fingers would get tired of holding down that little button before he was through playing with it.  Now, he'll play and play until he drops.

The two minor things I'd change with this light is the difficulty we've found in setting it just right so it stays on the floor; we do not want them scratching the walls any more than they already do.  Our kitties sometimes can't find it when it moved quickly and I think it would be improved if there was an option to set the frequency of movement.

Overall, a great product!",1
"This product is poor quality.  I wish with the beautiful design the manufactor should use better quality wood.  It is not for big cats, not stable at all",0

"I was hesitant on how this would work. My two chihuahuas are pad trained and I hate wasting so many bags or paper to pick up after them. This is awesome. It is super easy.

"The pump is quiet.  Only hear a slight humming sound when standing VERY close to it. Water bubbles up quietly. Took 2 cats 2 days to get used to it.  Taking advice from another reviewer, did not plug it in the first day in order for them to get used to it.  The cats drank from it just fine  after it was plugged in the 2nd day.  Easy to assemble and clean.  They both are drinking from the bowl but are ""studying"" the other 2 options to drink from. A friend of mine had purchased one and both her cat and small dog drink from it.",1

I like the jacket a lot and it really has helped my dog learn how to be more comfortable in the water! My only issue is that it has already started tearing up by the handles.

"Product was installed in a 2008 Scion XB.

The product should be assembled on a soft surface initially in order to avoid scratching.
Even though the product is fairly simple to construct and install, the help of another is useful.

After installation and two separate test trips, the product was removed from the vehicle. The adjustable bars to keep your pet contained slide towards the middle allowing your pet to roam freely inside the vehicle.

An attempt was made with electrical tape to stop this from happening by wrapping the bar near where they slide together, but after knowing that the barrier was able to move my pup began to push on the upper and lower portion of the barrier and unseat the compression bars that run vertical. This caused the barrier to fall.

This product was returned. Great customer service and response time.",0
"I bought these collars to alleviate anxiety in my two cats when we were traveling, adding another cat to the family, etc.
They do definitely bring the anxiety level down a notch, but with a huge cost.
My cat gagged herself with the collar while wearing it.  The collar did not release, and by the time I had discovered her with the collar in her throat (she had woken me up in the early morning by slamming into things and running around the house as if she was rabid), she had a laceration on her tongue and there was blood all over her and literally all over the house.  I immediately took her to the vet, where they discovered that she had only suffered a cut on her tongue.  They cleaned her up and sent me home with some anti-anxiety meds (because she was so shaken up) and antibiotics.
Upon writing to Sentry about the incident, they had me fill out a substantial amount of paperwork, provide pictures and documentation, but they DID give me a refund for the collars and the vet bill.
I'm very thankful that I was home when this happened to my cat so that I could intervene.  I'm not sure what would've happened if I wasn't home, but I can imagine it would not have been good.  Buyer beware.",0
"Cheaply made, lasted my dog a couple weeks before ripping",0
"Looks great, and the quality is good. After several months of constant wear, there's no fraying. I like that the buckle is substantial and feels like it'll last forever. My dog loves to put this on, I might add. We also have the matching leash. I would buy again.",1

".Great, easy to use and totally worked!",1
I wasn't sure if I should buy this or not because of the mixed reviews and confusion about sizing. I have a small Yorkie who is 7 lbs and the S(m) fit her perfect. It is cute and soft and I am really happy with the purchase. I will probably buy more from them.,1
Not satisfied with this product.  We have used it in the past with good results.  This batch is not killing fleas...,0
This product is amazing.  We adopted our dog at 2 years old and she started having struvite issues/bladder infections.  The vet wanted to put her on the low quality prescription dog food and I found this product instead.  She went from having a bad case of struvite crystals to NONE within one month of using this product.  Awesome!!,1
Just what I wanted,1

"Purchased Go Pet Club Cat Tree a little over a week ago, fast shipping came on time, easy to put together took me about 30-35 mins, only thing wrong with it was the left top sitting shelf was cracked in a little which is no big deal rather not waste my time with customer service. But over all my kitten loves it, one of the mouse didn't last two days though that got ripped off. Well worth the money.",1
I buy the bigger bag of this and then the other one that has too many goodies. I mix 90% pellets with 10% goodies and it lasts forever! My bunny doesn't notice!,1
"Mat is good but is smaller than advertised. The ""large"" is 14.65 width in the middle and length 23.75. Not the advertised 16x24 because it bowes in the middle. The extra inch plus matters for sloppy dog drinking. Had I known this I would not have purchased as it is not much larger than my current mat.",0
"I originally wrote an ""ok"" review for PetCube explaining that this product would be great if it didn't have so many connection issues. Within the next couple of months I progressively had more and more issues with the PetCube to the point it is now unusable. Additionally, I have wrote PetCube multiple times about the ""Care"" feature that my PetCube continues to lack with no resolution whatsoever.

I certainly was sold a DEFECTIVE product as it is now a BRICK that will not perform ANY of its advertised functions. I spent half an hour on the phone with ""tech support"" the other evening and they were still unable to fix my issue. WHY ARE YOU NOT OFFERING TO REPLACE THE OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT YOU SOLD ME?

BOTTOM LINE: Return ASAP if you're having ANY issues. Their tech support is a joke and you will end up RIPPED OFF just like me!

DO NOT BUY!",0
Did not work at all!,0
"This crate only housed our small beagle for a day before she destroyed it.  Not very happy with the quality: the metal bent very easily. Probably a great purchase for a tame and trained dog, but not for a dog, of any size, that may fight to get out.",0
"I purchased two of these cages for my kids.  Their dwarf hamsters are secure and happy in their new homes.  The water bottle hangs on the back and not from the top as shown in the photo (at least ours don't).  Our hammies have no trouble drinking from the bottle.  Also, I noticed in some other reviews said that the wheel makes noise, however ours are very quite. I love that it comes with almost everything you need, but you can add on with the tubes and accessories.  I believe you can buy this product with confidence that you are getting a superior product.",1
"I am NOT a fan of this. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because the concept is great, but the opening to put the clumps into is TINY-maybe 5 in at the most. I have a cat that likes to go in the same spot multiple times and the clumps didn't come close to fitting into the opening. I've never had a cat that this would work with. Also, You'd have to pull the lever to drop the waste into the bottom a bunch of times while scooping because that chamber is incredibly small as well. I get that it's supposed to be able to fit into small spaces but it just doesn't make logical sense to me. Maybe I have weird cats.",0
"These treats work wonders on my cat. As long as he gets 2 a day, he doesn't have any issues. Plus, they are a lot easier to administer than sticky gels.",1
"Not sure how long this will last as my Dobie pup grows up to adult size, but it will be a very good starter bell to teach her with.  I love that this bell is very safe for her as there are no places on it where she could catch a nail while pawing at the bell, unlike those sleigh bell types.  The sound of the bell is very pleasant as well.  The bell itself is quite small, measuring only an inch & a-half across.  The one I received seemed to be damaged because the black metal part of the bell was bent to one side.  I tried to straighten it so it would look like the bell in the picture in the item description, but I couldn't fix it.  (Yes, I know the bell is supposed to be bent over like it is in the picture, but mine was also bent over to the left side and looked crooked.)  It came with two tiny, ittsy-bittsy screws to attach the bell to a door or wall, but I don't see how they would hold a puppy of any size pawing at it, so I will be using something else to attach it ....so to sum it up, I don't see this as a long-term potty doorbell but rather something to get my pup through puppyhood and then I will be buying something that looks nicer.  If my review has helped you, please click ""Yes""!  Thank-you!
***UPDATE  7/17/2016***  I ended up tossing this in the trash and purchased a very nice brass nautical bell from Amazon instead. I wanted something bigger and more durable. The GoGo bell just looks too tacky on my front door. Oh well, at least it was a ""Lightening Deal""!",1
"My dog loves these, I think he might be a cat",1
Good size for small togs; squeaker died quickly.,0
Love it...yorkie loves it..perfect for her size...she does not eat much..very pretty,1
Good quality and cute paw prints!!!!,1
"Our doberman was getting her collars off all the time. I broke down and ordered this because I was tired of her constantly not having her collar on.

She hasn't been able to get this one off. She'll come in from playing and sometimes I'll just have to relock the clip vs having to go on the hunt for the collar.",1
Total disappointment. Had it in pieces in 2 minutes. Waste of money.,0
I bought this for my pitbull because pitbulls have very unique fur.  I have had a very hard time finding a brush that would work.  This is amazing at bringing out loose fur.  I also use it in the bath to massage in the shampoo and conditioner.  This is now one of my favorite brushes and recommend to all pitbull owners to have one of these in their grooming kits!,1
Worked great.,1
Our daughter's Appendix mare is in Oregon and spends most days out on pasture unless it is freezing cold.  Normally we go through at least two blankets because she plays rough with others or she tears the buckles and belts off...this one has last 1.5 years with only a small tear.  Well worth the price!!!,1
wouldn't hold a vacuum for more than a couple minutes.,0
"I bought this about a year and a half ago.  The tank and filter work well...the problem is the lighting system.  When it works, it looks great, but my lights and power supply have died 5 times in the past 18 months.  The company has been good about sending replacement parts, but its a continual problem which is not worth the time to have to keep fixing.",0
This is a great way to contain my two dogs when I'm not home. This is exactly what I was looking for. I needed a place for my two dogs to be safe and not create total chaos throughout the house while aren't home. This is the perfect product. You can add on to it if you'd like which is a great option. Overall this is a great product!,1
Worked exactly like the description.  No problems.,1
My dog won't touch this item.  She just doesn't show any interest at all.,0
It lasted less that 10 minutes. My dog is a serious chewer. She took out all of the stuffing by chewing a hole in the top of the lobster.,0
cover was ripped within minutes of use.  cats bored quickly of this toy. Would not recommend wasting money on this item,0
This is the 3rd one I've purchased for 3 different kids and I just love them. Great quality & fit.,1
"Too small for my dog and poor quality, ripped easily.",0
"Great tool for getting rid of tartar build-up for your furry friend. Watch the YouTube video for proper use and with a steady hand, patience and kindness you can avoid costly dental cleanings. Easy to use and very effective along with daily brushing with Petrodex. Highly recommend.",1
Great bed for my cat's hard-sided carrier.  Held its shape nicely after being machine washed and air-dried.  The bolsters give her comfort and security during travel.,1
"The bags are a good size.  Big enough to clean up after my Boxer and long enough to knot at the top.  Fragrance isn't too overpowering, but a nice touch!  Easy to pull off of roll and store.",1
Literally broke after 2 uses,0
Not at all up to description or expectations.  Knocked him out for the first two days.  Then stopped working completely.,0
This is the best toy I have ever bought my cat. Finally!,1
"Didn't help at all, suppose to make your dog more calm and that's a lie, I am having better luck on reading material my vet gave me",0
Best dog pooper scooper ever used,1
Broke pretty quick,0
"Purchased this for our 98lb dog: Loxer (labxboxer), and it fit great. He stopped pulling and walks are better :)",1
Wasn't powerful enough for an 8 month old lab and then just stopped working after 2 weeks.,0
"Love it, will buy again..",1
The puzzle playground is a cute idea. First of all when I put it together I noticed that there is one square frame that does not have an insert. I first thought that they forgot one but on the box it shows it comes with one extra frame. So I just used the square frame for the bottom of the box. Next if you want this to stay together even a little bit you need to use tape. It does not stay together and usually when you get one piece clicked in another piece falls apart. Its pretty much junk.,0
The range is extremely poor. At max setting of 10 it barely gets to 3 ft high in Yardmax mode. And at 3 ft it is not fully reliable. So for larger dogs it doesn't work. I bought and returned 2 and they both had the same problem.,0
"My 100lb 2 year old lab loved this toy but annihilated it within a day. She did seem to like the flappy parts but the stuffed part of it ripped at the seams after a few hours of indoor play. Also, she liked to solo-play with it, but I never saw her hold it centered in her mouth and shake it like the drawings on the packaging show.",0
Magnet is weak.,0
"Just had to send them back.
The tinsel was falling out as soon as I opened the pack. My kitten would eat that.
They weren't even round they were sort of squished. The tinsel was in sort of haphazard, not even all around.
Besides they sent me seven in a ten pack! The maths-what is it?",0
"Great sphere! Still have all my shrimp, you have to find the right space for this, you should keep it out of direct sun light, but in a well sunlight room, love it!",1
I have tried to contact you about the product. I found plastic in my dogs treat.,0
"My dog can easily lift the cage door and knock it off track and literally bursts through the door and knocks it fully off track. NOT happy, wish I could return, but window has closed.",0
They didn't stay on for more than 3 days,0
Worked great for about 4 days and then stopped working...,0
"I have very large Ragdoll cats and this covered tray is a good size for them. They can get in and turn around in comfort to do their business. I do also like the translucent lid--I can see into the box. I have only previously used hooded boxes that were opaque, and consequently looked dark and spooky inside.",1
"Did not work to regrow hair, in fact clumps of hair started falling out next to where ointment was placed. Also did not prevent or treat scratches/dew poisoning/a topic dermatitis. So basically did nothing as described. Would have returned if I had not opened and used product.",0
Great !,1
"Product misleading.  It says strong clumps, but then it isn't a clumping litter.",0
I've tried this product not only on my tank but on friends' tanks as well. All this does is...NOTHING. After using this product I see a red tint on my filters but hey! my water is still cloudy. Don't waste your time or money!,0
"My cat hated the mouse, because it was gooey.  So, it was difficult to get my cat to be still while putting that messy crap on his head to cure his ringworm.  Do not recommend.",0
Did not work for me.  Must have been defective.,0
Awesome collar for my 6 month old German Shepherd mix.  Great for training and easier on his neck.  Highly recommend.,1
"The perfect size for my Cocker Spaniel puppy to grow into.  Easy to assemble, and light enough to carry.",1
Wouldn't be without it.,1
Why do I buy these? The crickets never seem to eat on them. I guess I am hoping they nibble while Im not looking. They seem to prefer a potato more.,0
Did not work for my 2 Cat household.,0
Two male cats...one with a really dry coat despite giving him wet food only.  Added Shed-x they won't touch it.,0
"The cat loves this, that is all that matters.  One of the few foods she will completely eat.  Most other brands, she will have a bit and then leave it.",1
my cat played with it for 5 minutes. pulled the spring and furry thing off and hasn't  played with it since.my cat is very playful and almost 2 years old,0
The problem with this toy is that it doesn't have enough room in the neck for treats to get around the rope. Unfortunate.,0
"This s fabuious!  fun, warm, useful, cute and not hard to get on or off the dog, Large fits my 17 pound dog.",1
"Does not work well. My cat does not produce a lot of fur, but I sometimes see hair on the couch and clothes. I bought this produce hoping it would help with the shedding, but it did nothing. Do not waste you money on this product. I regret this buy. Straight to the trash",0
"I do love this.  It is hard for me to hold on the the cup itself, so this is exactly what I needed to be able to hold onto the cup so easily.",1
"This was a lot cheaper made than the reviews would have you believe. I'm going to use it as a secondary hutch for my rabbit to play outside in. Pieces of the pre assembled wood were split along the screws from manufacturing. I would have expected the wood to be in better shape. It is flimsy too. Instructions were not good, I went off the photo on the front of the box more than the paper. It was pretty quick and easy to put together though. Even with poor instructions.",0
Works great for our 12 lb Shitzu. The bed was a little high so we added a thick board under the back of the steps and it works great. It took a little training with food but she learned fast.,1
Disappointed. Light in the collar quit working within two weeks.  Two other collars we purchase are fine but not this one.,0
"this litter does nothing for the smell, is dusty and tracks everywhere! i definitely would not recommend this to anyone!",0
"this seller has the best price for this amount of product online. i have used this vitamin for years, and my birds have not encountered any problems so it must work well.",1
Shoes are great but the straps tear off almost immedietly . Second wear and the straps are already not connected to the shoes:(,0
Kind of expensive for what it is used for compared to other bulbs. Also burn out pretty often and need to be replaced. Would not recommend,0
Dog doesn't like,0
"Didn't realize this product was so toxic until I received and read the fine print. pitched and used barley bales, which are organically safe and work well.",0
"My cat hates this.  She won't even use it at all.  We tried it for several days after we got it, and she refuses to eat out of it.  Now it's just sitting in the corner collecting dust.  This was a huge waste of money.",0
"I have been feeding this to my cat for years and its been great for her. Her teeth are great and the vet commented on how youthful she is.
Amazon always has a great price, cheaper than petco.",1
These litter boxes are amazing. Used them before and definitely buying them any time i have cats,1
Very good product. I would buy this again.,1
"My rescued Siberian cat is rather spoiled. Both his dry and wet foods consist of high quality ingredients and his cat tree is a hulking 8-foot condo. If you also care about your pet, then I highly recommend the ShedBGone De-Shedding Tool. Amazingly, unlike my cat's expensive foods and furniture, this comb is value-priced; furthermore, it outperforms de-shedding tools that are four times its price!

Siberian cats have a dense, triple-layered fur coat. As such, a couple de-shedding tools I have used in the past did not satisfactorily remove my cat's undercoat. This ShedBGone comb, however, works its magic quickly to remove virtually all of the dead and excess fur. One de-shedding tool I have used in the past caused my cat to scramble away as soon as I pulled it out, likely because it causes my cat discomfort. This tool, however, actually encourages grooming. My cat seemingly thinks this tool provides a massage of some sort - he actually stretches himself out so I can run this comb over his fur! Hilariously and adorably enough, he often turns over to the other side as soon as one side is groomed, and he even flips onto his back so his stomach can get a nice massage - I mean, a nice grooming. Since using this particular tool, both my cat's veterinarian and I have noticed healthier fur. Due to regular usage of this tool, I have not seen any tangled or matted fur.

This ShedBGone tool is also a pleasure to the groomer - that would be you and me! The silicone handle provides an outstanding grip so I can maneuver the tool any way I desire. Another plus to humans is that regular grooming will significantly decrease the fur you'd find on your clothes, your furniture, and well - as most owners of furry pets will understand - all over your residence.",1
"This really does help get the fleas off your pet that you cant see! My cats love it, I guess it feels like a massage! It's a win-win!",1
This company was very kind and helpful. They offered condolences for my pet and made me feel good. The order came very quickly and it is a perfect pet memorial.,1
"When Meow Mix discontinued their hairball formula I tried Iams. My cats are not picky eaters but they are barely eating any. Its been two weeks and I am not risking their health on it.  Work or not, they won't touch it!",0
"We bought this about a month ago and I'm amazed at how well it's held up. Our big puppy has destroyed almost every other toy, but now this is holding up and keeps him entertained. It bounces & bobbles & floats. We couldn't be happier.",1
great dust i use for my chin! he seems to enjoy it!,1
"Recently bought two of these collars. One worked as described, the other was defective and did not work. If I were to purchase an anti-bark collar I wouldn't waste the money on these for all the headaches involved.  The instruction sheet is also useless and incomplete.
Update: After asking for a refund I did receive it, so at least I'm back to one collar that works and I'm not out the price of the second collar.
Update: 2nd collar stopped working after 3 weeks of use.  Don't waste your money here.",0
"The FDA has issued warnings for this treat. I personally know of the danger, my dog died after one single treat, the only one he had his whole life, and it ended it. Over 4,200 dogs have been affected by these.",0
This product has been a big disappointment. Starting with poor instructions and including lazy engineering. What is sad is that with very little extra cost this could be a good product. It works but it could work so much better with a battery gauge and a more straight forward on-off process for both the transmitter and receiver.,0
"it stuck for about a week, then lost it's suction as the plastic just want create a vacuum.",0
"I stuff this with string cheese. My dog loves it, hasn't even made a dent in it, and it keeps her busy longer than most other treat toys. I put it in the dishwasher to clean it.",1
"Works great, love how easy it is to keep puppy by my side.",1
My dog does not like it.,0
"UPDATE: WORKED 3 WEEKS THEN STOPPED

I'm so angry right now it's a good thing I caught my tank temp it had gone down to 78F I change water and raised it 1.5, gotta be safe but now 1st thing in the AM I need to run to the pet store and pay for an overpriced thermometer. ARARAAAGGH",0
"Pretty poor, outside is great , inside completely fell apart  into a bunch of crushed fluff, inner liner is cheap and just shredded, all the dog did was lay on it, great price poor quality",0
"I recently purchased the Astro Pro remote dog collar. What a life saver. Thank You! Since my purchase we have seen great results.  I have a 70 lb. Treeing Walker Coonhound. We have a huge property and our Max loves to be outdoors. He becomes very hyper and loud when the stray cats and other neighborhood animals come around. His barking disrupts me and the neighbors both day and night.

I use this training collar for keeping my Max in the yard as well as his barking under control. The range is great with a huge property like mine. I use the the vibration option on remote setting 10, this grabs his attention immediately and the barking will stop. I have occasionally used the static stock option on setting 5 when he is focused on the animals in sight and the vibration is not enough. Not only has the nuisance barking stopped but he no longer leaves the yard. YAY! The barking was so bad, at first my neighbors thought I found another home for him.  I love the fact that I can easily switch from vibration to shock with just one press of the button. The color coding on the buttons also make it easy to distinguish one stimulation from the other. Wonderful training tool! You guys rock!!!",1
Awesome product for $34!,1
Its okay but makes a loud gargle/bubble noise when the dogs drink from it and one is now terrified of it and refuses to use it. Other containers weve had in the past don't make any noise.,0
"I bought this for my 3-month old Cat.
He is a little bit afraid of this litte thing at the very first, but it's seems like he is getting better right now.
Love this Product.",1
"Worked for exactly 3 months. I followed all instructions and it worked until one day it just didn't. I believe there is a fan inside that pushes the mist out through the tube that stopped working. The unit will make mist but will not push it enough to even leave the top of the tube built-in to the tank. Not the quality I expected.

EDIT: Awesome customer service! I was ready to write it off, but the company contacted me and sent a new base to the mister that is working great at no charge! This company actually cares, VERY nice to see!",1
"Super soft, has squeakers in all four paws, this toy is perfect for gentle chewers but if you own a Tasmanian devil forget it, it will be destroyed in seconds with limbs, tail and back seam ripped apart.  This toy is our dogs bedtime buddy since he was a puppy and in eight years we've replaced it a couple of times due to a mishap in tug a war incident with his Labrador room mate whom destroys toys.  ""Swinging safari. Leopard"" can be machine washed and repaired with needle and thread when a limb gets ripped off or when a ear falls off along with a tail.  I've sewn mine back together again with no problems.  Amazon has the lowest price for replacing ""Mr. leopard"" on a regular basis when its beyond repair for replacement.  Recommended for dogs who don't destroy toys or need a special companion during puppy hood or a pal after being spayed or neutered.",1
"I must admit that I was extremely skeptical when I first ran across this advertisement! I thought to myself, *No Way* is the ""Navajo Manufacturing Company"" going to ship out *12* ""Cat Fuzzy Ferret Toys"" for only $11.50! But I was so wrong! For I DID indeed receive 12 wonderful Ferret toys that are well made with real Rabbit fur!

Yup, leave it to the ""Native Americans"" to continually understand the importance of using *ALL* of the animal Vs. just using its meat!  Oh and I've also discovered that this ""Navajo"" Corporation is not just another greed driven corporation either! They do in fact care about their products quality, quantity, as well as offering us an outstanding price deal to their customers as well! 

Note: The ""Vo-toys Federico Ferret"" toy company was selling *ONLY ONE* Ferret cat toy for $12.13! ($7.74 + shipping $4.39) (This is why I ended up confused regarding the amount and price etc.)

Lastly, I can tell you that both of my cats went crazy over this toy as well! Even my Chihuahua went crazy over this toy! I did have to end up taking the toy away from my Chihuahua btw, but not before he had ripped its tail off! (heh) However its all good as now both of my cats have a toy to play with! One of my cats plays with the Ferrets body, and my other cat plays with its tail! (Grin) Oh and btw, of course this cat toy is American made! (which makes this toy all the better as far as I'm concerned...eh?!  ; )",1
"This is the product to get.  Even with the filters, depending on the environment around your fountain, sometimes your pump will just burn out.  So rather than buy a whole new fountain, just buy the pump kit.  It replaces everything from the wall adapter to the pump (2 pieces).",1
"This product is poorly designed. Do not be fooled by the pictures, videos or other reviews. The flaps are thin, are not fit correctly and do not seal at all. The magnets are weak and might work for a very small door but are worthless for a Super-Large product. The size of the flap allows a decent breeze to blow open the flaps. The amount of air flow that moved through the flaps was greater than my previous single flap door. This is unacceptable for a product claiming to be Ruff Weather door. This will not work in a Northeast Cold Fall much less the Winter.",0
As expected.,1
"I would not call this Monster at all.  When they say 4-5"" they mean it.  I can get a better product at better price at local pet store.
Dissapointed.",0
"My dogs food dish is by the back door to the yard just off of the kitchen, and I found that somehow ants would pick up the smell  and find their way to the food dish.  I tried putting the dish on a plate of water,  but I have a silly dog that liked to drink the water that her food dish was sitting in instead of the water out of her water bowl - then the ants again found their way to the food dish.  Plus the water gets to be messy.  This pet food stand not only solved of the ant problem completely, but it also gives a little boost to the dog dish so it's more comfortable for them to eat .  I believe this comes in different sizes and I purchased the small one which was perfect for my schnoodle and Lhasa apso.  I do recommend taking the time to look at the dimensions to get the right size for your dog and also to ensure that you purchase the proper size dish to fit inside,  overall this is been a great purchase, and has saved a lot of headaches.  My kitchen is once again ant free!",1
"I ordered this last year after doing a TON of research.  It is a beautiful carrier, and the pockets on the outside are really handy!  I needed to fly with my dachshund, and dimension-wise this should have been a lock for his measurements.  However, the way the space actually works inside he didn't even fit.  There are a lot of pockets and other fancy additions to this carrier, so I guess those take space away from the actual inside measurements.  If your dog is borderline with the size of this, go with a different brand.  They do charge you to return it, even though the dimensions posted online are misleading.  I ended up going to Meijer and purchasing a very simple, inexpensive tote (AKC brand) that had no bells or whistles, but maximized the inside space for my dog.  It apparently had the same dimensions posted as this carrier, but seemed much roomier.  I flew Southwest with it, no questions asked, my dog was more comfortable, and it was less than half the price of this one.

If your dog is tiny, this really is a nice carrier, but for a dog that is questionable in size or length (like my tweenie-sized weenie dog!) I would purchase with caution.",0
"Great for my 5mo Frenchie. Easy to put a pee pad under the grass & on top of the drain tray. He hasn't pulled at it yet, but I do wish there was a snap or clips in each corner holding together all the pieces so they didn't just loosely sit on top of each other. Shake out loose grass, otherwise very sturdy product.",1
A thin roll a sandpaper.  Vibrates on the nails which my dog didn't like. The friction also heats the device/nails.  This may serve to smooth and round nails after cutting with traditional nail clippers (if your dog will tolerate the vibration).,0
"My cats love these, they love any soft food",1
Don't waste your money. This blanket is tiny and cheap.,0
"Seems decent but if your dog likes to chew or tear at all, don't get it. Dog destroyed it in about 5m flat. $45 down the drain. Was able to get through the seam in seconds",0
This is the perfect height for my 85lb pit bull.,1
No sure why but my dog thre this up and orange from the turmeric was a mess. Seemed like a good idea at the time .,0
"Honestly after spending over $1200 in vet bills and meds what eventually worked to clear up my dog's skin was this. He had some sort of yeasty infection on his coat that made It look like mange. He would scratch so much he made his face bleed. We still don't know if he had an allergic reaction to something but between the 3 weeks of antibiotics and this shampoo, it finally cleared up. We also got him a collar and I put the little booties on his feet so he wouldn't scratch so much. My Rott was not amused!",1
"Cats love this food and literally tore the bag opened (not their usual behavior). I've noticed their coats are shinier, eyes brighter and cleaner, and my biggest boy seems to be leaner and have more energy... but I haven't weighed him. My other heavy girl has better breath. My vet recommended this brand next to science diet. Since I'm trying to get as many years out of my kiddies as possible- I went this route.",1
"Handy! Double click the button to brush, wrangle the dog, double click and swipe away the little fur after the brushing!",1
"Love the price compared to other sites, lasts me a while with my pet rabbit and is way less smelly and allergenic than other things I've tried in the past.",1
didn't even last 30 minutes!!!,0
"It does what it's supposed to do - scrape. It's feels strong and durable, and I think its also rust resistant.",1
"This is a great product.  Frontline doesn't work for me anymore, this stuff does.  So, use it for the next few years until the bugs become immune to this!",1
"I love this product. But over the years the package has stayed the same. The price has increased. Bu, very disappointing, the amount of chicken has decreased",0
"Many people say to not buy this if you have metal roofing, but also our generator, washer, dryer, cars, and gas tanks caused problems.  I'm not sure what the ideal setting is for this.  When flagging the beep line, it was variable by 5-10 feet, not consistently beeping in the same spot.  A wired system is much better.  We returned thus right away.",0
"Great little bowl!  My newly rescued dog was moving the bowl across the floor every time he ate.  I saw this and ordered it, and it's great. I might order another one so they match!",1
The liquid burned my dogs neck,0
"My 1 year old cat loves this toy. He will follow it around for hours, diving on it occasionally. Every morning, he is waiting for me to set it down so he can play. Cons: The batteries do wear out after a few hours of use. The bug is so small it can get stuck in tiny spaces you wouldn't think of (between dishwasher and wall, for instance. Luckily I was able to fish it out with a long stick). The constant vibration helps to locate it when it gets stuck somewhere crazy, so that is a plus.",1
"This just came in the mail and I opened it up right away. It was very easy to put together. I was surprised at the size of the bed itself, it is very large- much larger than I was expecting which is great. I put it up and put my kitten in it right away and she loves it. She is 3 1/2 months old, so she is still pretty small, but she still loves it! She has a little scratching post with a bed on top of it so I moved that a little closer to the window seat so she has somewhere where she can jump down to since she is so small. I got the one without the pad which is fine because the bed itself has enough room to put a blanket or pad of your choice!! Great value!",1
Did not work what so ever! Waste of money,0
Love these products!  This is unscented and didn't irritate my dog or me.,1
Great treat.  Like doggy potato chips - they seem to love the crunch.  Low cal and healthy too.  Crumbs left at bottom get sprinkled over kibble for a little variety .,1
"Gave it two stars only because my hamster doesn't like them and won't eat them. But, another hamster may like them so who knows...just rating on my experience which was a waste of money.",0
"I'm not sure what the application is for this. Urine just clumps, wet, at the bottom of your pan. It's quite course and doesn't scoop well. It's cheap? I guess it has that going for it.",0
Was in pieces in less than an hour and my dog hasn't torn up any other dog beds ever. The cover is very thin and easy to rip.,0
cat won't use it,0
The pattern is so light you can't tell what it is. No matter how many times you line up the sides it's still off. So I put a plant in the corner to hide the huge gap. It's so flimsy I ripped it trying to get the bubbles out. So another plant went up. I hate it. Wish I could return it. Waste of 20 bucks.,0
Ill say that the leader works great on my Great Pyrenees. Even my 11 year old can walk him without being pulled over. The problem is the clasp is really cheap plastic and breaks. Ive bought 2 in six months and both of them have broken.,0
Terrible,0
"This harness looks nice and fits my 4lb Maltese well (x-small). The problem is that it is not made for leash pullers. The loop where the leash clips in is attached to the neck portion of the harness, and there is not an equal distribution between the neck and body. So when my dog pulls on the leash it digs into the sides of his neck and chokes him. Also, because you cannot readjust the circumference of the neck, there is some struggle taking it off. This product is not effective, and a hassle when taking it off my dog. I do not recommend this product and I will never buy this kind of harness from this company again. There are much better and more effective harnesses on the market.",0
"Simply it does not work, it does not kill any fishes nor ICH. My friend even warned me this product won't work but I didn't listen to him and wasted my money on this junk. I used this product very early sighted ich when I noticed my fish dashing around more than usual, I followed the instruction words by words and after a week and finished a bottle, ICH still there and spread much faster and covered entire fish body. I stopped using this product and bought a copper base ich medicine from different company and I can see the improvement overnight with just 1 dose.",0
"What a ripoff. Yes I didn't read the full discription, but I buy the 12packs for the same amount of money!",0
Dogs didn't really like these.,0
"This is not a very good product. I had this for 12 hours and the platform already snapped off. The wood itself broke, so there is no repairing it. Not very well made and obviously really cheap.",0
"I purchased this, thinking it would be similar to the Go Pet Club 72"" tree (which I've attached a photo of), which I have two of and have held up amazingly well over the last two years I've had them (despite upwards of twenty pound cats constantly launching themselves off of it).

That said, it is anything but- if you combine the cost of this + shipping, it's only $20 short of the Go Pet one. Do yourself a favour (and your cat) and buy THAT one.

This is an extremely floppy/ flimsy tree- the boxes, especially, as they are collapsible. I've only had the tree up for four days and it is already significantly leaning, one of the boxes collapsing in itself, despite being supported by two walls (having placed it in a corner). I think I'll be lucky to get a few months out of this, while I had been hoping for years.",0
"My parents bought one of these for my cat, Scooter. He loved it so much I bought two more. He drags these crickets around the house and SLEEPS with them. Just a nudge makes them go chirp-chirp-chirp. It's one of his favorite toys.",1
I ordered two of these and they were packaged together.  They are very thin plastic.  One of them was broken when it arrived.,0
it was AWFUL his allergies worsened dramatically. HE had bleeding sores and I have about 80% of the bag left that is in our storage bin and needs to be thrown out. HORRIBLE for allergy dogs this is NOT non-allergenic as stated!!,0
"Her favorite toy. The squeakers are great. Only "" problem"" is we have to hide it while we are watching tv.",1
Great product! Thanks,1
This products leaks and I'm returning it. Completely soaked my hamster tank,0
our dog is happy can come and go from the living room to other parts of the house and we keep the heat from the pellet stove in the room not needing to leave a door to the pantry open.,1
"I was looking for a food that had ingredients without corn or by products in it, (which is hard to find), so I was excited when I came across Wellness food. I have been feeding my cats Wellness canned food for years now but decided to finally try them on the dry food. I tried the Wellness dry salmon food on my cats, and not 1 of them would even taste it! I left this food out for 3 days for my cats but they literally starved themselves that whole time! I really had high hopes for this food but Wellness needs to come up with a healthy recipe that cats like.",0
These poop bags work and a steal.,1
I love getting free shipping so it is great that you can add on dog treats at a good price. My dogs love them.,1
"When I unpacked this table, several screws were out. I thought nothing of it and just put them back in. I used it once for my own dog and more screws fell out and she doesn't move at all on the table. The grooming loop also broke while she was standing still. Table looks high quality but it's deceiving. One screw was also rusted. The company did refund my money so that's fine.",0
"Little more sunflower seeds than expected, but the cockatiels are enjoying.",1
I honestly would love to give this more than 2 stars but a hose is leaking after first hooking it up to our system yesterday and they don't offer any sort of return policy or replacement or contact info. Being attached to a saltwater system this is extremely important that all pieces work properly and without flaw when they are shipped but that is obviously not the case with this one.,0
This thing is awesome. A friend let me borrow hers and after I used it I decided I had to have one. Very strong magnetic on these. I bought the large and it's a bit too big for my 20 gallon (My opinion but still works just the same) but that's ok I plan to Upgrade to a 55 gallon. Fast shipping. Would buy again.,1
"The censor worked great, but the actual collar all unraveled. I was very disappointed with the collar, and I can't just at the bark censor onto a new collar.",0
"Winner!!  Whether for exercising by chasing and swatting the ball, or for scratching, and even just for laying on!!  My two cats use it differently, and I haven't even sprinkled any catnip on yet!  As I'm typing this, I think my Jack just spoke to the ball in a meow I've never heard.  Hysterical.",1
"I originally tried these but bought them from a pet supermarket, they worked great. These bought from amazon are worthless junk. Both my dogs still have fleas.",0
It does not fit the standard small The frame I have,0
This is amazing!! No more litter box and easy for the cat to get used to. Wish I woulda started this earlier,1
I thought these would be perfect for my 10 lb Shih Tzu but she will have nothing to do with them I think its a no odor or just not the thing for her but I did find Nature Knaws that she does love,0
Size was too small and the material was not good quality. The thread of the sweater started to come out,0
"I have to change my review. I ordered a large size, which they may have to make a little sturdier for bigger sized animals. It lasted two months at best, chewed through 3 times, which I was able to mend; however, one lunge while on a tie out after a squirrel, and the second upper d-ring busted out, along with the handle piece. One note, my dog seems to prefer a collar to the harness anyway, this may be preferable only to her, or possibly the majority of dogs.",0
"Good quality collar, stitching looks like it will last long, fits great.  This is just what i was looking for, width is just right for my 45 pound Gordon Setter.  Now we are ready to go on vacation.",1
"The dog just stands on it sometimes and doesn't care about the noise. It does, however, let me know she's on the furniture so I can tell her to get down again. Lol.",0
the felt is not glued well .It came off and my bog ate it then through it up,0
Item arrived on time and is as described and expected.,1
Dog started tearing off pieces after about 5 minutes with it.,0
I haven't used them for long but i think I m going to buy more for my camping gear .,1
My dog could still chew where ever she wanted,0
Works,1
"Cat won't eat it. Bought two cases and my cat hates this stuff!!!! Hates.
And he isn't a picky cat.
Update. Garbage",0
"I realize now ""Four Square"" may be the brand of the bowls, but it appears to be 4 square bowls for sale, especially with the photo showing multiple bowls. As you figured out, I just received the one bowl. It is fantastic quality, but I was looking for cheap ceramic simple bowls and I'm so disappointed right now.",0
Super nice!  The cats love it,1
Left film on floor and notice no change.,0
"Great, makes it easier on me to throw further and help my dog get his exercise faster.",1
"These last two bags I purchased have so much crap in it like weeds, twigs and even some blackeyed peas!  Quality control maybe an issue.",0
"At first, my daschund will not lick it...she thought it was a bone because of the scent and ended up chewing on it and ruined half of the brush.  I don't think it works for every dog so you would have to test it first before buying.",0
"Our (neutered) cat, who had been happy, well-adjusted and never destructive recently started marking/spraying in our new home.  He is still affectionate and playful and hasn't seemed stressed at all.  However, the spraying continued.  We got this product based on the claims that it reduced or eliminated spraying.  DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT!  The spraying has actually increased dramatically while using this product including five times just this morning while prior to using the product it was once maybe every three or four days.  It seems this product has worked for some to calm their cats but I can tell you that the claims of controlling spraying seem to be completely unfounded.  I would NEVER consider purchasing this product again.",0
This product did Not work for my dog.  Seems like a lot of money for just Turmeric.,0
"First, it's a great price. It's extremely roomy (have a Pyrenees mix) and works perfectly for him. It's very sturdy and extremely easy to assemble. Very happy with my purchase!",1
"My dogs tags no longer make a lot of noise on walks, which keeps the neighborhood dogs from barking at us for the most part",1
"Pros: visibility, rechargeable
Cons: not adjustable, not 100% waterproof
Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. Would like to see future models gain waterproofing.",1
I thought they would do the trick but my dog who eats anything did not like these,0
Really tall but fits great in the corner without taking up too much space. And my cats love it. It wasn't too hard to put together...I just needed someone taller then me to install the last tier,1
"this thing is really hard to clean around. If you have a cage hanging from it, you have to be extremely careful even walking near it. The little bolt it came with to hold the hook was a joke and my cage, with birds inside, fell off 3 times after being lights brushed by it. luckily i ziptied the cage together and my birds didn't get hurt.",0
My bunnies love them. They finished them very fast compared to the other pellets.,1
"This is my first time buying this cat litter and my cat and I love it!! No smell, no mess, and a little goes a long way!",1
Works as advertised.  We have three cats and two dogs with different fur and it works for all of them.,1
"The clipper came with no directions for use.  Supposedly there is a file at the bottom of one handle,
and I have no idea how to get it out or to use it.  The clippers themselves are not good.  When I
clipped my dog's nails, they were jagged and rough-edged.  I'll keep them rather than go through
hassle of shipping them back, but I would not advise anyone to buy them.",0
"Filter media provided with the package is the wrong size, customer service 800-322-1266 is just an after hours recording. The magnum 350 lasted only 3 months before it started leaking, against my best judgment I decided to upgrade to the newer product. Turns out I should have steered clear of the brand entirely. This one is going back to amazon as fast as I can ship it.",0
"Actually, I don't love it but my cat does.",1
Have a 25 pound dog. Worked really well for him . The 360 rotation was really nice and the retractable cable worked well.,1
My dog hated this treat!,0
These are the worst cheap puppy toys ever. My dog destroyed them in less then a day. I would never buy these again,0
too messy,0
"WAAAAAAAY underpowered and out of spec for what it is supposed to supply. I have this unit with 2' of head feet. According to Danner's spec sheet, it should flow 550gph at that head feet. That's 9.1 gals per minute. That's laughable. I filled a 5gal bucket with it in 2:40 which is about 115gph, less than a quarter of what it's supposed to flow.
FAIL.",0
We recommend this product to give to your dog regularly. It really helped them when they are sick and as continued support if needed.,1
Pretty Cheap and small and didn't work well.,0
My puppy has hours of play all by himself. Cold or warm he is happy playing with it and carries it where he goes.,1
Arrived this AM. Looked great ..played tug of war for 10 minutes. Went to put on shoes and coat ..3 minutes..and 40 pound one year old lab border collie mix chewed it in half. It is about as tough as butter.,0
"The design is poor. The legs should have been shaped into an upside down V to prevent the edges from tipping. My cat wants to like it, but every time he tries to put his weight on either end, it tips forward.",0
i don't know if this was good or not because it didn't work,0
Excellent Product!,1
don't spendmoney on this. Did not work at all.,0
To small,0
ON MY 2ND BOTTLE. LOVE THIS FOR MY PUGS,1
It was delivered today and was super easy to put together. I have a minature Chihuahua and these steps are perfect size for her to get onto the bed.  Definitely a good buy.,1
my cat will no use this litterbox; guess she was too old when I got it (10+) and looked at this thing like a spaceship landed in the house. She hates it.,0
"I love this harness for my pug puppy. It is soft, lightweight and the buckle opens and closes easily.  I am going to purchase the next size up now that she has outgrown it.",1
"Works great and hasn't skipped a beat in the few months I've had it running. I have it set up to dose 3 items, each 3 separate times a day. Only small issue I have is the air bubbles that appear in the output side of the tube where it connects to the existing tube. I would normally drop a star for this, but it doesn't appear to affect the precise dosing at all.. and this is already priced far far below the closest competitor. The price and the fact that it works and is easy to program give it 5 stars for me.",1
I ordered this collar for our daughter's Amercian Bull dog who was losing his hair under regular collars. It worked out great and does not irritate him at all. Good price.,1
Good for my HEAVY chewer bull dog.  Put some peanut butter and freeze it for an hour and it'll keep her busy.,1
"Does not have wide enough ledge to fit on back of tank.
Clogs easily.
Noisy",0
"Great item, great price!",1
"The cat constantly scratched at it until it was either torn or pulled away, making it virtually useless.",0
both dogs could care less.,0
My dog goes nuts over these. The more annoying the squeaker the more she loves it. And boy are these squeakers annoying. Drove her crazy.,1
"I bought this product March 20, 2016 for $25. At first I liked it, but now it doesn't work. Both the remote and collar are fully charged and the collar doesn't beep, vibrate, or deliver a shock. The light works (which is useless), but nothing else does. If you want a product that lasts more than 3 months get something else",0
Worth every penny. Fits my cat great and allows for adjustments. I feel safe with this on my cat because of the design being balanced around the entire upper body. This is not to be used for leaving your cat tied up outside; a cat can break out of this harness if they pull hard enough (it's for safety) This is for walking your cat and not allowing them to pull away from you.,1
"My Chesepeake Bay Retrivers and cats were laying on our beautiful patio furniture.  Who wants to sit on a cushion with dog or cat hair, dirt, and quite frankly... stinky.  So, I researched, read tons of reviews of various products and was considering this product and the scat mat (emits a static charge to discourage pets).  A good friend, who is also an animal lover like me, had the scat mats or an equivalent.  She said ""Don't waste your money"" and explained that her dogs (dalmation, german shorthaired pointers and mutts) could tell if it was on and simply did not respect it.  She said if it was on, they even figured out how they could get up on furniture without touching the mat.  So, I tried these mats.  I purchased 2 of the ""3-packs"".  I can say that my review will sound just like the many reviews I read.  From the day I put these mats on my furniture, the pets have not been on the furniture.  The sound emitted is just like an annoying smoke alarm.  for chair/ottoman combinations, I lay the mat across the chair and on the ottoman together.  I also had a problem of one of my dog taking a decorative pillow off the furniture and ripping it to shreds.  so I just put the pillow under the mat or touching it.  The down side is the beauty of the furniture is cluttered a bit with the presence of the mats, but I just remove the mats and hide when we plan to use the chairs and love seats.  It is worth the inconvenience, by far.  This product works for all my pets and the furniture is saved.",1
"The worst thing ever.  DO NOT BUY.  Doesn't work.  Will not shock.  If there is moisture on the ground, the fence could be 1 foot to 10 foot from the wire for the beeps.  It beeps and does a minor shock but doesn't phase the dog at all.  My wife held it in her hand on the highest setting, still nothing.  Customer service sucks.  You would get better customer service from someone on the street.  We have talked to them 10 times, they will not stand behind their products.  Stay away!",0
"Love this. My golden doodle loves it. Play it in house too, shoots up the stairs nicely.",1
"I have a 7 yr old small dog that had a hard time recovering after trips to dog beach and hikes.
I've been giving her this for 6 months now and have seen a huge improvement.
Ask a vet if it's recommended for your dog prior to giving.",1
"My dog loves the flavor of these things, but they're a bit small for a medium sized pup (she's a 45 lbs Bearded Collie). These are five inches long, but they're basically the width of your finger. They're pretty skinny! Still, it's a great price for a snack. I give one every two or three days, but don't expect a stick to last more than 24 hours. If they're a hard chewer, expect 30 minutes.

Remember it's not a good idea for your dog to consume large amounts of rawhide, as it can lead to impacted bowels. Just use them in moderation, especially since these are small, and you'll be fine.",1
It's pricey but my horses liked it.,1
Holding up well.  The plastic handle is already cracked but feels think.  So I'll blame the dog-,1
Very easy to remove. My cat got this off in less than five minutes. She will not keep it on like she has with other collars. This might work if your cat does not remove his/her collars.,0
"I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing.",0
Aquatic Arts = First Class!  I would buy from again and again.,1
My kitten seems to like it! I put it next to a window so he can watch things outside while relaxing on his spot. Easy assemble. Sturdy. Carpet is comfy.,1
This size works great for both our 60 pound shepherd and our 23 pound terrier.  It is durable and doesn't break into a messy mush like other chew toys.,1
This collar broke my dog out so bad that she couldn't eat! I would not buy again and will not recommend this to anyone. Pure sh't,0
Buying a great product AND doing good.  A great combination!,1
My dog knocked two of these off the kennel. The welding didn't hold. Disappointed.,0
Fish hated it and wouldn't take it despite pre-soaking and starving. They take Frozen & Can O' Worms though. Pretty disappointed.,0
The collar worked but it was so difficult to remember what numbers did what. It also broke and stopped working completely about 6 months in. I've used a few different collars and never found one that lasts but this one broke the fastest.,0
"Beware!! After reading many of these reviews,  it is very easy to tell that a lot of them are fakes.  The term "" pet dog"" coupled with poor grammar is mentioned in several of them. Makes me very nervous to buy this product now.",0
Gave the toy to my dog and within 10 minutes he had almost chewed through the rope attached to the ball.  Waste of money,0
"Bought this for Tug - our 11 year old Chesapeake male.  He is an outside dog and in the summer in Nashville that gets hot.  The bed is sturdy and simple to assemble.  We place a fan on the ground pointed at the bed and with the elevated mesh, Tug gets circulation all around.  The bed is just the right height for him to get in and get out. That is important as he is moving a lot slower now due to his age.  Very happy with this purchase.",1
"If you care about providing your koi with quality food, then buy Hikari. My koi love this food and it is the only food I'll buy. I've been feeding them Hikari for years and they have stayed healthy and put on massive size.",1
It did not work .,0
"This was a joke product.  It came off with one swipe of a paw, and popped immediately (less than 60 seconds).",0
"This is such a piece of crap. Food drops whenever it wants. It drops more than it is supposed to, if the cat sticks a paw up inside it... out comes three cups of food. If you bump the table it's on.. there's another cup of food! Then god forbid you have to move it.. all the food comes pouring out!

How is this portion control if it just dumps food haphazardly?!?",0
"I was very optimistic that this would do the trick w/ my rescued barker.  Unfortunately, it didn't phase him in the least even after adjusting it to its highest level.  Wouldn't recommend for a determined and persistent barker.",0
I do not know what this is -- it does no more that soapy water would do -- nothing.,0
Keeps litter on the mat and not all over the floor. Just shake and it is clean. will order again if I need another. We have 3 cats so it is very helpful.,1
Doesn't  work for s.. ($&#,0
"I am sure these are wonderful chews and work well, but my dog just would not eat them, despite my best efforts to disguise the chew.
I am giving five stars, though, because the seller sent an email to see how I liked them. (I did not wish to return them, dogs do not always like everything....I planned to donate them or give them to someone.)
Anyway, when I wrote back and said that my dog would just not eat them, the seller kindly issued me an apology and a refund. So rare in todays world.
I hope to be able to do business with them at some point, and at least give a good referral.",1
I bought this item hoping to resolve my male dog's urine spots on the grass. It didn't work.,0
I just received my vest and I LOVE it! I plan on using it as a vest for my service dog and attaching his badge too it. All the pockets make it very convenient and the material is very durable! The shipping was fast and the price was great. Thank you!,1
I have never been able to find pads this large.  I LOVE THEM!!,1
"Didnt last more than three hours before our 8 month old GSD flipped it, tore a hole in the bottom and ripped the padding out.  Its $18 so its not a huge loss, but it definitely won't be bought again.",0
"I tried these when my dog was a puppy and recalled not being impressed with them, but when these were the only brand carried by the pet store I was at I reluctantly purchased them and boy, do I regret it. Walking my dog today, he did his business and I pulled the first bag from this roll. I opened it and stuck my hand in it to pick up the poop and the bag ripped at all the seams just from the force of opening my hand inside of it. I pull a second bag off the roll and very open it as gently as I can. I reach down and pick up the poop just in time for one of the seams to rip and poop to get on my hand. I use the remains of the first bag to wrap up the torn second bag and finish my walk with a poopy finger. I get that these are marketed as environmentally friendly which likely explains why they're so thin and flimsy. I generally try to buy products that are less harmful to the environment (I drive a Prius), but if it takes two bags to clean up a poop or if someone ends up throwing out all the bags after getting poop on their hand like I probably will, then how good is it for the planet really?",0
"The concept is nice but in reality these did not agree with my little 13 pound terrier's tummy. After trying them 4 days in a row, at the recommended rate of one per day....each day he vomited, I was hoping it was unrelated. When I stopped giving them to him the vomiting cleared up. We did a test and served him one about a week later and it happened again! We're giving them away and trying Zuke's. We shall see...",0
"Perfect way to train Garrin on going potty.
Just after 1 week he's got the idea.",1
This disc lasted about 20 minutes with my dogs. They had it destroyed before we'd completed ten tosses. I would not recommend this for dogs with teeth.,0
Well it does a pretty good job at stopping the liter from being tracked all over.  The problem is if you have cats that like to crap places other than in the box like on this mat there is no way to get it clean.  It is like a sponge.,0
Our puppies are so cute with these.,1
be careful they will leak if not handled correctly. unfortunately the design of the twisting handle is not the best. it never really closes fully so you will have to wait and see if it leaks to determine whether the base is actually latched on correctly.,0
We have a 12 year old dog with hip pain and back leg stiffness... an employee at our local pet store suggested the Licks for her..so we tried it and 30 days into using the Elder dog licks there have been remarkable changes in her all around health..jumping up onto chairs and beds and running around outside as if she were 2 years old..I'm so glad I took the employees suggestion.. Just bought my third box..can't do without it !!,1
"This dog figure is beautiful!  A real treasure for my dog figures collection. Well packaged, great service. I love it!",1
So nice I gotta order twice. My dog loves me bill and the sound.,1
Great size for my German Shepherd.  She loves it.,1
"My cat loves this play station.  He sleeps in it.
No to catnip.",1
Arrived damaged. Item shipped in original box with no protection. I was really disappointed and sad that I needed to return it.,0
Ridiculously over priced. Will not buy from this seller again.,0
Neither of the two heaters worked! Very disappointed!,0
Have been using slicker brushes for over 30 years,1
Dog would not touch it,0
Excellent tank very clear using in wet/dry sump for about one month,1
"My experience is too much like others here--I got the collar, charged it and the receiver, filled it.... it worked once and now is not working at all.",0
This was advertised as a 3 piece set and all I received was a patch.  $14.95 for a patch?,0
Perfect fit!!!!!,1
"Not worth your money. Mine has stains that cannot be removed and now after a few weeks, many holes, which my puppy can now get out of. Would not waste your money on this item! Cheaply made. One star for packing and the way it looked the 1st day I got it. It is NOT  durable or practical for your pets!",0
"This guage is inaccurate and dangerous. The adhesive used frequently gives way, leading to it falling off. A snake or reptile could easily get trapped in the glue and tear its skin off.",0
"Putting in the electronic dog door is the best upgrade we've made to our house. It keeps the cats in and the wildlife out, and I don't have to come home at lunch to walk the dogs.

We recently purchased two new ""keys"" to replace a broken one (and have a spare for guest dogs). Both work but came with dead batteries. Fortunately, I was able to kludge together a solution but it was very disappointing. Now I have to make another trip to the pet store to get fresh batteries.",0
Plastic screw mechanism is cheap.,0

did not fit impossible to put on.,0
"I ordered 4 bandanas from this company, three patriotic American flag items plus one other. The flag part was very small-you could hardly see it. It sure didn't look anything like the picture. I also have issues with the shipping and handling process. The bill was $44.87 of which $24 was charged for shipping & handling. I hit the buy button too soon on this one.",0
"This dog toy IS tough!  I have a German Shepherd and a Lab.  They LOVE to play tug of war and they have destroyed most of the toys I have gotten them.  The Shepherd is particularly aggressive with tug of war games with her toys.  So far, this is the ONLY one she has n to killed.  Easy for two dogs, or one dog and one human, to garb and end and pulll away.",1
Love the vest very durable...,1
I have three adult cats and two litter boxes. Buying my litter from Amazon is extremely convenient and Arm and Hammer is very economical too. I order four boxes at a time and am fanatic about scooping the litter boxes so my house doesn't smell of cats. This is an excellent litter.,1
Sent these as a gift to a very picky kitty.  They are Purrfect!,1
"Works like a charm.  Used it with my stubborn beagle/bull dog mix and within the 3rd time walking him, he stopped pulling.  I don't even use it anymore and he hasn't pulled since.",1
"I am torn how to rate this toy... as my 1 yr old kitties LOVE them!  Yet, they started falling apart within the first 40 minutes of play.  :(  The fav one, the one with the wand, totally broke.  The others started coming apart.  And eventually within a couple weeks the second fav which was the other one on a string bungee had the cord come apart in many places (a piece of which I believe one of my cats actually ended up ingesting).

The customer service is great, in that I received an email from them checking in on the product moments after I had opened it .. so I could immediately share how they were falling apart, and they immediately refunded me.  I was disappointed as I really wanted them to work!  And, I was curious why they just did not send a replacement?  Made me think that perhaps this happens more frequently then shared?  Would love the product to be fortified to withstand PLAY by cats who love it !!!",0
"I actually bought this at Wal-Mart for $25.  The plastic is a fairly thin (for crate expectations) composite and not very sturdy.  The snaps on the side wouldn't stay snapped shut.  When I first put it together, the door fell out of it's holes.  My cat easily wiggled the door when in the crate, and I worried he was going to bust out of the crate!  I returned this crate the very same day I bought it.",0
Doesn't move nearly as much as I wanted it to move!,0
Size smaller thank picture. Didn't fit my dog.,0
"Many of the ""branches"" fell off while I was washing the plants. The plants look good but are so hard and spiky I worried my fish would harm themselves.  I opted to toss them in the trash.",0
"This is the second one I ordered. My dog likes it so well, I purchased one for my sons new puppies.",1
"Transmitter doesn't work.  After spending 150+ bucks on the collar, it is very annoying to open it to have the transmitter not work.  It is also rather annoying that I can't just exchange the product, but I must wait for a refund in order to order another collar.  At this point, I would hesitate doing business with Brask again.",0
Nice quality steps for my two toy poodles. The cover is removable which makes washing it a breeze. Great for keeping little dogs safe from injury.,1
"Terrible waste of money.  Bought 3 packages based on the great reviews on Amazon.  Product doesn't stick to upholstered surfaces, that's if you can even keep the tape from turning into a tangled mess. I couldn't get the tape to stick to fabric because it kept clinging to my fingers-I was literally blowing on the tape so I wouldn't have to use my fingers to adjust. Save your money and sanity, get regular double sided tape",0
This I returned it didn't even keep my dog in the back for 5 min.,0
"As always, I soak and scrub each item I put into my tank. When I started to scrub these plants, the black ink on the base started to come off. It stained my fingers, the brush and the bucket. With the ink washed off on two of the plants, I can see the glue that holds the stems in the hole. I didn't want to risk putting a possible poisoning item into my healthy tank so I threw them away. The colors of the plants are very nice, though.",0
"This the collar started to malfunction at 28 days into the warranty period and then stopped working all together after 33 days! The collar began to randomly vibrate, sound and shock my dog. Then after recharging the battery, the collar could not be turned off so it could not be reconnected to the transmitter and used at all.  I am returning it to Amazon and going directly to a non amazon seller for a collar by another manufacturer that has a longer/worthwhile warranty.",0
Good product and pricing reasonable. Was exactly what I was looking for when I searched Amazon.,1
"UPDATE 2/3/2017 (Nearly 6 years since purchase)
We have loved the ability to take this to two different homes since it was purchased. The system's perimeter is variable, so you can make it smaller or larger, whatever suites your space. This is an excellent feature because we went from a home with an acre to a home with less than half of that. We didn't have to completely retrain our dog every time. We simply walked along the perimeter and when the collar started beeping he backed up. We did this one time at each house with success.  The batteries die about every 30 days, so you will be spending $8-10 for two batteries every couple of months. The collar seems to be waterproof.  We use the longer prongs for our lab. We haven't had a problem with him getting any sort of sores or callouses on his neck from wearing the collar at all times.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
Prior to installing this fence, our 95+ lb Labrador retriever would make daily treks around the neighborhood.  We'd take him outside, he'd look at us over his shoulder, and eventually sneak away.  He's loveable and a big goofy dog, but not everyone loves a 95 lb. dog.

This system is really easy to use.  We have a very uneven lot, it drops from the highest point in the front and back yards to the lowest points about 15 feet.  That hasn't affected the performance of the fence.  Just to clarify, the static charge won't keep shocking if the animal breaches the safe zone, it will only go for 30 seconds.  When we first began training the dog with the fence, our dog would just take it.  We had to use the highest setting for that reason and also because he has a thick coat.

Easy installation, we just found the most middle spot in our house relatively to the yard to plug in the device.  More flags than we needed were provided.  The instructions are clear.  The training, although their program is 14 days, didn't take very long with our dog.

I'm very, very pleased with this system.  I decided to use a wireless system after asking friends and neighbors what they used.  A lot of the complaints I heard with the wired system was the yard men kept cutting the wires all the time.",1
"My boys stay close and walk as a team! Enough leash for them to ""do their business"" too! With two separate leashes they would go opposite directions and it was slightly chaotic. Now they focus on the walk (or squirrels haha) together :)",1
ehhh didn't work . but ya win some and lose some.,0
"not absorbent at all! placed this on a hardwood floor and my dog used the pad and the puddle went completely underneath and ran all over the floor. Would not recommend, should have paid more attention to the reviews before wasting my money",0
My chinchilla absolutely loves these. She freaks out whenever she sees them and snatches them out of my hand.,1
"My dog eats it. She seems happy. The poop is a good texture, which is nice.",1
Really cute- and my OCD kitty who can't stop scratching it hasn't wrecked it yet (she has claws) and it's been around 2 mos.  Good product.  I removed the bell from day one because it annoys me- was easy to do.,1
I am sorry to say that this harness did not last more than five minutes on my bulldog.  She pulled and the harness broke by the rivets.  Not good at all when you live on a busy street.,0
My cat loves this cute bowl. Less mess to clean up after too.,1
"The first battery used was fine. It last a couple months. The second battery used only last a couple of days. It may have been even shorter but I don't check the collar every day. Now there is no returns after 60 days. How would I know if all ten batteries are good within the first 60 days!
Buyer beware:
DO NOT PURCHASE!
Inexpensive batteries that are made to a lower quality level.",0
"I got this sweater for my 55lb. female boxer. While she falls within the cited measurements for the XL, it really doesn't fit her lean physique. It's too tight through the chest and not really long enough to be comfortable for her. It is a cute pattern and it laundered well.",0
Keeps our  2 Guinea Pigs from being able to flip the food onto the cage floor.,1
what it from china,0
This cover sure beats covering the crate with a sheet or blanket that constantly slides off.  Has velcro attachments and stays on the crate.  The black color darkens the inside of the crate for privacy/quiet time and you can leave the door flap up or down as you see fit.,1
Cute! But they don't stay on well. I wish they did!,0
My son insists on using natural litter.  This is the best product I've found and it does the job.,1
It killed my fish...,0
"This is my Lab's favorite ball ever.  It has 2 handles, so she doesn't have to drop it (she's not always good about that), and I can still grab it and throw it again.  Great toy!",1
Cats sleep in it after scratching their nails.,1
Much more than I expected. Very durable and not to talk so our dogs can get into the box and get their favorite toys.,1
"Literally a life saver. At age 18, our most beloved diva cat was down to 8 pounds from 12, constantly throwing up, had lost all the fur on her belly from heck to tail (with sores from constant licking), and was having 4 to 5 kidney infections/year--with terrible kidney labs. She was 18, and we were pretty clear she wouldn't be around much longer, so I was willing to try this.

Almost a year later her fur is thicker than I can remember it in years, she's back up to a healthy 11 pounds, no more vomiting, active again, and NO KIDNEY INFECTIONS since we started these drops! She won't last forever, but she sure regained a life with this product.",1
"My puppy loves these! I had another natural brand before this as I didn't want to feed unhealthy treats to my puppy, but they were higher priced and you get fewer in the bag. This is a fair sized bag with a decent number of treats and they are a healthy choice for treats and my puppy loves them. I use the Crazy Dog Train-Me! Training Reward Mini Dog Treats as well as they are smaller and great for training. These are a larger puppy treat that is more satisfying as they are larger, but my puppy will grow less eager for these if I give him too many as he gets a bit satisfied. The puppy training treats are so small it takes a lot of those before my puppy will get satisfied.",1
"These litter box liners have worked great for me!

I have 6 cats with claws & they have never torn the liners, but I do keep about 4"" of litter in my litter boxes, as a couple of my cats really like to dig deep.  If the litter was not deep, they probably would tear the liners with their claws.

The larger size is great, allowing me to tie it closed after sifting.  I just tuck the extra under the box.  I have 2 litter boxes & sift them every other day & have no litter box odor at all in my small home, but that may not be the case if you do not use a premium scoopable clumping cat litter.

I also highly recommend Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Premium Scoopable Multi-Cat Cat Litter, which I buy in 40lb bags.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious-Cat-Ultra-Premium-Clumping-Cat-Litter-40-pound-bag/dp/B0009X29WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bag</a>.  Available here online, sometimes on sale for $16 with free shipping, or at Getco or Getsmart for about the same price.

I have owned cats for over 40 years & with 6 indoor only cats now, BELIEVE ME, I have tried my share of cat litter, always searching for the perfect one. This one is excellent!!  It has great odor control, is hard clumping, dust free (some kitty litters are so nasty with dust you need to wear a mask when pouring them), does not have a fragrance or perfume odor & is the very best cat litter I have ever used!!  I am really happy with it and so are my cats, as they are all using the litter boxes all of the time.",1
"This is the best collar I  have found. They are strong and durable. Very comfortable and attractive. Easy to fit, with lots of adjustment.",1
"As my title states, these 2 dog treat bones are not high quality (but really, you probably already knew that) and my dog only chewed on it twice. The first time only took a sliver off of the bone and then the second time only ate about 3/4 of an inch. It's now been almost 5 months and he has not touched it since. I am going to throw it away. Ugh.

Pro: It's a good size for a yorkie (7.8 pounds) to chew on occasionally.

Cons: ingredients - wheat starch (potential allergen), powdered cellulose (harsh on bowels, could be crushed peanut hulls, possibly contains recycled cardboard, cheap filler), chicken powder (all the leftover chicken parts that human-grade meat factories toss and then grind up and cook fully then make into a powder such as tumors, diseased organs, bones, feathers, feet, beaks...), soy flour (potential allergen).

The price was about $100 dollars less than at other stores.  Arrived in a timely fashion.  Only problem was that one of the wheels came broke and a second one broke within about ten minutes of putting it together.  Able to buy wheels at lowes to replace.  overall happy.  The bird loves it. Lots of room,1
"Nice ramp, but carpet is too slippery, my 10 year old boxer should not have to strain to climb up ramp. Take advice from other reviewers, pass on this, wish I had. At least I received a full refund, and was told to keep ramp. I guess Ill give away...",0
My 18lb cat loves this thing and fit into it with some room to spare. He spends a lot more time either inside or atop of it (aka less time messing up the rest of the house)! Cheers.,1
Ok,0
"It was too small for my dog and returned this item. My fault, thought it was much bigger. Return process was fine.",0
Great product works better than advertised. We also use them to secure gates with one hand. Great price too. You will not be disappointed with this product.,1
"The bag has to be stretched to fit the jumbo box, which results in plastic ""bridges"" or pulled areas in the litter. The cats do not like it! I gave it two stars because having a bag is better than no bag.",0
Catnip is non existent in the tube.  Would not buy again.,0
"I got this for my 4 1/2 pound Yorkey. This is the best color I've gotten by far. It's talk quality, will probably last forever, right Rangers colors, sturdy class, and fits him just fine.",1
Not worth the recent $4.00 increase recently applied. My dog likes these but there are other treats he likes also that cost much less and nutritionally good,0
"Cute, cute, cute. Very nice material, excellent fit.",1
perfect. Oscars love it,1
Been using for some time at least 6 months. Doesn't  help breath at all,0
"Very small, like remnant.",0
Bought one in May. Second time using it the clips will not snap in place. Essentially no better than a beach towel on the seat.,0
"For those having issues with the RFID tag, if you are just wanting to control the time of day your pets can go out, there is an easy solution!  Just tape an RFID tag to the flap.  I put it towards the top so the pawing on the door doesn't accidentally knock it loose.  The door works by the RFID tag being near AND the pressure from the cat or dog pushing against it to get out.

I just wanted to prevent my cats from getting out at night when they are more likely to want to go beyond my yard.  So, I taped the RFID tag to the flap and set the timer to restrict them from going out (but not in so a cat who is out at that time can still get back in) after a certain time.  They can then get back out in the morning.  Works great!

Love this product!  Makes it so much easier and, unlike magnetic flaps, the wind can't force the door open.",1
Description is a little misleading as to the size and lbs. when i first read it says medium to large dog seat 15 to 28 lbs. When you read down further it has actual size which is for a medium dog to 15 lbs. I ordered a medium size thinking my dog would fit well . My medium size dog could barely fit in it or turn around so I had to send it back. Never had a chance to check the weight part out. There was no reason to since it was to small. My dog is a medium size Terrior.,0
These are fun for your dog and a good tug toy.  But the cotton thread is easily chewed off the toy and digested by the dog.  Probably not that big a problem since dogs pass all kinds of things through their system.  Really these tugs should be used under supervision.,0
sdfghjkl;/,1
advertised as chicken jerky...this is not true.  product is large floppy sheets which need to be cut before my dog will chew them...would NOT buy again.,0
Needs to be primary filtration . Use with caution,0
This is the best car harness I have every had.  It is very strong and the clip is strong and will not open.  Also the end that locks into the seat belt will not pull out.  I had one that pulled out of the harness.  I recommend this one for being strong and has the best clip to hook harness.,1
Great product. Works well in helping my dog who has collitis.,1
Perfect step for my old Rhodesian Ridgeback as well as my 6 month old German Shepherd puppy to get in and out of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Sturdy enough for 105lb dog to use but slips in and out of trailer hitch easily. I love this step -- so glad I bought it. It makes getting my two dogs in and out of the car easy.,1
Our Hamster loves it!,1
Was to small for my golden retriever so I'm saving it for my daughters puppy she's getting soon,1
This feed is very bad for guinea pigs the souls never be feed sends,0
This product was small and hard to hold. I found it better just to use nail clippers to clip the pets nails.,0
"My Doberman ate this with great appetite.  Several hours later she got a horrible diarrhea that lasted several days, and turned bloody along the way.  She also vomited on several occasions.  Nothing else was different about her diet during that time, so we know it was caused by Nylabone.  One month later she's still extra sensitive to everything.",0
My cats would not eat these.,0
"The package arrived when it was 3 degrees in Chicago and I didn't notice it at first so it may have been outside for hours. Surprisingly, the plants were not frozen thanks to the heat pad and extra styrofoam packaging inside the USPS cardboard box. One delicate plant (perhaps Ludwigia) disintegrated and I wonder whether it was frozen or perhaps cooked by the heat pad. Valisneria looked like it was dying, but I planted it and in five days all old leaves are disintegrating but there are new sprouts, so it survived.
I received (in order of my preference):
1 dead and disintegrated, most likely Ludwigia Repens
2 Amazon Swords,
1 Cryptocoryne Wendtii Green
1 Valisneria (barely alive but survived),
a bunch of 7 Anacharis,
a bunch of 8 Cabombas,
a bunch of 8 Moneywort plants.
This is a nice bunch for fresh starters. I personally don't care for Cabomba and Moneywort, not a big fan of Anacharis either, but not bad for the money. I just wish the advertised numbers were followed more strictly. My 75 gallon tank on the photo has some extra plants (the biggest fern on the right and smaller bronze cryptocorynes and other smaller plants) but you get the idea.",1
"I wanted my cats to try this new wet cat food that recently hit the market. I like it as its not in the usual pate form canned cat food comes in. It's more of a chunky consistency which my cats like alot. It also has alot of gravy. Although my cats love the gravy part of their food, this cat food contains alot of gravy which is my only negative. I feel that if they just decreased a little of the gravy, a little more of the actual food could be increased.  I will buy it again as my cats enjoy it.",1
Good light for the price,1
Our lovebird loves these pellets.  We bring our bird to a vet for yearly check-ups and she always receives praise for her health and beautiful feathers.  We like to attribute all this to her wonderful diet of Harrison's pellets.  Since our lovie never ate seeds it was easy to get her started on these pellets.,1
"Our cat doesn't like this one either - won't even taste it.  She loves the standard Wellness brand canned tuna slices, and readily eats it.",0
"Toy was interesting at first, but now, about two weeks after receiving it, my terrier mix has done something with the squirrels/chipmunks and we cannot find them. Sometimes she will play with the house, but what good is that without the critters that go in it? Definitely requires parental supervision! Maybe these should be tethered together somehow...too expensive to have missing pieces.",0
"Read the reviews, so I thought I'd try it. Unfortunately, I didn't like the fragrance.",0
Would never buy this again!! super cheap. They don't stay charged!!! Cheap... Cheap!!!!,0
"Very disappointed, seeds are not black or oil, they appear very old, dried out, lots of extra debris, twigs, chunks of matter, old broken seeds.",0
One of my two cats uses it a couple times a day so it was worth the price. It is good for the cat to scratch and stretch their muscles.,1
My cat loved it.,1
Did not work whatsoever on my dog. More pulling than just on a regular leash and collar.,0
Got condensation on the inside of glass tube did not keep accurate temperature.,0
"We've owned several Red Dingo collars. I never saw the chain pattern in any stores, but it looked perfect for my 1-year-old male German shepherd. It's as high quality as other Red Dingo collars (excepting the reflective ones, which peel within a few months) and I love the design. We need to get the matching leash next!",1
Exactly what I was wanting to start doing my own filteration,1
Worked well for us after amputation surgery.,1
"While the product looks well made and cute, I will echo previous reviews about sizing. I ordered a large based off measuring and probably need a small. At least he can grow into it. Lol",1
"My golden will need these for the rest of her life, so having to pay the vet price is going to break the bank. Fortunately I found this much larger version on Amazon that is a little more than what we paid at the vet, but includes double the amount of chews! Shipping was fast and my dog loves them. I will buy them again when we get low.",1
"I didn't even put this collar on my cat. My cat had just caught her old collar with bells on it in the tracks of the sliding doors of the bedroom closet and her old collar broke just like it was supposed to. It was the simple thin elastic. This time I thought I would try thic ""Safe Cat"" collar. I was very disappointed when I looked at it and tried to copy the various angles my cat would have to be in for the collar to have to ""break-away"". No Way! I could find only a very few exact angles where one part of the collar would have to be stable and the other would have to be pulled at just the right angle to be pulled free. That is not at all what happened to her. So she never even got to wear it.
  Since it costs so little, I just chalked it up as a loss. It is very pretty though.",0
"Licks is a really wonderful product and works great. My Yorkie mix has allergies that make her skin very itchy and uncomfortable. Within a couple of days of adding Licks to her food, her allergies went away completely. No need for expensive Vet visits or prescription medication.",1
The birds don't like it,0
"made the mistake of buying this,it's terrible. came wrapped poorly,doesn't stay sink and does not look as good as the picture. I wish I could give this a zero star.",0
Dogs love them,1
my dogs had it in pieces in seconds.,0
Dog doesn't like them,0
The bristles ARE tight enough that they work on my German Shepherds straight hair and the undercoat nicely! Its hard to find a brush for her. The handle could be longer and wider . It tends to make my hand sore after a good brushing. Otherwise it works very well.,1
"it's more like sand than litter...when it gets wet, it sticks to my cat's feet and he flicks the dirty, wet sand all over the house...Yuck, will not buy again!",0
Dog does real good,1
"While these might work for some, they didn't work for us.  We moved cross continent with our cat I wanted to do everything I could to make it easier for our cat so I thought I'd try these.  I tried giving her one a day early to get her used to the treat but she rarely ate them and I ended up throwing the treat away after just sitting there for a day.  Not such good news!  On move day I gave her one  about every 2 hours.  When I took her out, to rest, they were still all in there...bummer.  I would not buy them again, but every cat is different and they may work for you.",0
This is a Small width by any standard. Definitely not a Medium. Had to return and buy an XL.,0
"Love this scooper I bought one ten years ago it finally broke, so glad it's still made just got a new one!",1
Really works better than other brands because of the Phycox so the cost is minimized and we only give one per day,1
"Great product to keep your dog smelling fresh between groomings. All natural, removes dander, flakes, excess oils and keeps the cost shiny",1
"This toy should come with a health warning - for humans! I have just purchased Da Bird for my cat and I have never seen her play with anything else this way. She goes totally nuts for this toy. In fact I play with her, then my husband plays with her, and we collapse exhausted on the couch, having had enough, and she still insists on playing. We just kind of prop it on the table at that stage. I have never yet had her get bored with it. She actually cries when it disappears back on top of the refigerator, where we hide it, and where she has yet to discover it. I'm not sure what will happen when she finds it goes up there: )
When you buy the toy make sure you buy some refills as well - after such heavy duty-playing they get pretty mangled quite quickly. My cat is usually pretty sedentary and picky about toys, but if you only buy one toy for your cat make sure it's this one. And buy yourself some energy bars at the same time : )",1
Great product. my cat love it.,1
Doesnt work.  My dog is still leaking.  Been over 3 weeks now.,0
Cute costume but it arrived with a huge hole near the neck where it was poorly sewn.  A third of the collar was not attached.  I was able to stitch it out of desperation since it arrived on Halloween and I needed it that day but would not order again.,0
The treats were extremely dry when they arrived.  I was disappointed because my cat loves the cat treats so much surely my dog would love these products too.  Not the case.,0
"Returned, too noisy.",0
"I wasn't sure if our old flap had the logo on it, as another reviewer mentioned it won't work if you didn't have that logo and was fully expecting to have to re-engineer this to make it work - but it turned out to be a perfect fit replacement. Our old flap was only 4 years old, but was gross and the logo had gotten totally mucked up by the dogs going in and out eleventy bajillion times a day. I am very impressed with the replacement flap & its even quieter than the old one was! Probably because its new and flexible and not old, dirty and brittle, but I'll take what I can get. One of our two dogs is unsure and needs some coaxing because I suppose it freaks her out to be able to see through it, but I'm guessing she'll get used to it real quick.

Installation was easy. I used an electric screw driver and was done in under 2 minutes from start to finish. Will definitely buy again when its time to replace this one.",1
"The balls don't bounce very well.  And they certrainly don't make random, extreme directional changes.  A poor product unless you were throwing it onto the roadway or a very flat, hard surface.",0
Have these crates in 2 sizes now. Love love love the side doors.,1
"My three cats go crazy for catnip.  All 3 sniffed at these fish and walked away.  I think these cat toys were add-ons because they are out of date and ""smelled out.""  I guess you could order and dip them in fresh catnip, but I would rather just have my money (which Amazon refunded - thank you).",0
did not hold up and smaller than expected,0
"Really, really awful. Like death. Words cannot describe the stench that wafted out of the package the second I opened it. My daughter, sitting in another room, asked what smelled so awful!

We recently adopted our first dog. Our vet suggested we use Pill Pockets to give her a daily probiotic (because her farts smell, too, but not nearly as bad as these). I bought the Duck and Pea Flavor. We use feline Pill Pockets for our cats, and they have no odor at all, so I was SHOCKED by the odor from the Dog Pill Pockets. I managed to use them three times before I thought I'd try giving the dog a probiotic without one. She gobbled it right down! She loved the Pill Pocket, but she likes the probiotic just fine without one. So now I'm stuck with an opened bag of these. I'm afraid to put it in the trash for fear a neighbor will call the cops to report a dead body.

I'm guessing dogs love these, which is probably the point. But dog owners should proceed with caution!",0
"This one leaks... big time...
The bigger version was just fine but not this one.
I am either going to go back to the bigger size or just get the one from Cos**o.",0
"Smells like fake cherries. Top will not stay closed, so all my wipes dry out.",0
Great price. Great product. Great shipping. What more could one want.,1
Too small. Not for made for big dogs. Its too small for a German Rottwieler! I purchased the largest size also.,0
Love this flea comb. I use it to get the eye gunk out of my puppy's face.,1
"Fish love this food and it is easy to use.  Have no idea where the extra bit of change tacked onto the Florida sales tax comes from though.  I wonder how much revenue is generated daily by these ""slip-by"" pennies.",1
"2 stars because the bag came with a tear even though the shipping box was completely undamaged. Resulted in loose dog food in the box. I also worry about contamination if the tear was present before shipping.

As for tastiness, you'll have to ask my dog. So far, no complaints. Just barks.",0
Dog was able to reach down and chew it. Lasted one day!  There is a reason most name tags are hard and just found out why.,0
"inexpensive (for a wavemaker), controllable, silent, and small... overall a great piece! one wp-25 (and a koralia 3) on my 72gal is plenty of flow/ waves...",1
nah,0
"I spent $25 on these.  They worked, I think.  My dog was peeing in her sleep on a nightly basis.  3 days after I started administering these pills, they worked.  For a few days, and now she is peeing again on about the 7th day.  The biggest problem aside from I'm not sure if they are a good solution, is trying to get these pills into my dog.  She finds them in everything.  I have researched and tried every method out there (hiding it in cheese, meat, a hotdog, making it powder and putting it in her food, or mixing it into yogurt, or goat milk.  She has become suspect of everything I give her to eat, and I think its starting to create a bad habit of not eating when I feed her.  I have had to resort to jamming it down her throat, and trust me, doing this twice a day for the rest of her life, really sucks.  It's difficult, and unpleasant for both of us.  I wake up, and I dread having to give her, her first pill of the day.  I'm going to try Leaks No More.

~Allen",0
The size good,1
"My cats are OBSESSED with this brush. They love it and will actually meow for it. It does a really great job of removing fur too. (I have one short hair and one medium hair cat.) You will be amazed at how much hair comes off. Really helps with shedding and hairballs.

One of my cats loved this brush instantly. The other one took a while to get used to it. So if your cat doesn't like it at first, I recommend that you keep trying.",1
"The straps were a little too long for my dog.  He is only a puppy and has not filled out completely yet.  I just took a tuck in it that I can let out later if needed.  But, other wise it is working good.",1
"This is no longer PSPC Phycox, it is now made by Dechra and contains cornstarch, which is a potential allergen. I am sure they are very effective if your dog is not allergic to corn products.",0
Great item and value  Thanks,1
I love this collar.  I walk my dogs late in the evening and this makes it so much easier to see them and for others to see them as well.,1
I have bought four bags of this dog food and every bag has had dead roaches in it. Good size dead roaches.,0
"I have fed this product to three cats over the past few years. I had a cat that was allowed outdoors and he was a big hunter who regularly ate entire rabbits. He was healthy eating a combinatiin of ami cat food and wild game.  That is until he was eaten himself by a bobcat. I replaced him with two kittens who were strictly not allowed outdoors do to risk of predators. These two were a brother and sister pair. They did not have access to hunt or eat meat besides the occasional house mouse. I did not give them the supplements that are advised to be given to vegan cats, particularly the males. I went in to the hospital for six weeks during Nov and Dec and had to have my cats fed by someone else. When I returned, the male cat was urinating with what appeared to be blood in his urine. No one reported this to me and I was away for over two months altogether so I have no way to tell how long he was sick. I was financially very broke and the vet cost around 300$ any time we visit. The cats were spayed and neutered and had their rabies shots but I was not in the position to be able to afford to bring him to vet at that time. I opted to go online and order a product that my son in law said had helped his own cat who reportedly had a similar issue. I gave the formula to my male cat as directed but he sadly passed away within two weeks time. I felt terrible for not being able to bring him to the vet to treat what I believed was a simple urinary tract infection. I blame my cats death on my own negligence as I had also ignored the advisory to give cats supplements, particularly males, when feeding a vegan diet. This will always plague my mind and heart. When you follow a vegetarian diet it can be difficult to have pets. My vegetarian standards are based on religious implications. That being said animals are not religious and they incur no karma for doing what God created them to do, eat meat. My first male cat had access to hunting and he chose to eat meat. He was then eaten himself and the bobcat commited no sin. My second male cat had extremely limited access to hunting and got only a random mouse on occasion. He and his sister were raised on ami cat food from the time I got them at just a few weeks old. The male cat died shortly before his second birthday. His sister on the other hand is still alive and appears to be healthy. She is still being fed Ami cat food. But I now have supplements that I give her in treat form and they are made from animal source. I simply did not tell my husband about this because I'm not going to argue with a Vedic priest. Ill simply do what I need to protect my pets health. I would be very cautious feeding this food or any vegan diet to a male cat. Do your research and please be responsible. i believe the bag of cat food should have a warning advisory to remind people that they must give their cats supplement or there may likely be health complications particularly in male cats.",1
"I did spend some time reading up on this GPS unit before buying, but the following issues make this tracker almost useless.  I would recommend looking for a different brand.  For me, money was not an issue.  My dog is a service dog and comes with me everywhere I go.  He is very valuable and important, as well as traveling with me wherever I go 24/7.

1)  This trackers GPS area is not small enough for most household yards.  I have a half acre of property and that is too small an area for the tracker to identify and warn me if my dog goes outside of it.  My dog would have to run down half of the block before I would get an alert. This is a major flaw in the whole concept of warning you when your dog has escaped from your yard.

2) This GPS tracker only gives you 15 minutes of trip time before it will alert you that your dog is out of the ""set area"".  If you take your dog to the park, or for a walk around the block, or to the store you will get alerts.  You can press the button again and again to add another 15 minutes, but this is just plain poor design.  You should be able to turn the alerts off for trip mode, and then turn it on again once you are done with your trip.  The only solution to this, is to turn off the email and text alerts for when the dog goes out of the area.  This makes the unit next to useless for tracking your dog if it escapes.  That is half of the service that this unit provides.

3)  The other half of the service the unit provides is to help you find your dog if it escapes.  Once the dog is outside the home and away from the charger, it goes dead fast.  So if your dog gets out of the area and you half to find him, you have limited time.  If you travel with your pet on vacation you have to bring the charger with you and plug it in to your hotel room, families home, etc.

4)  The neoprene cover that comes with the unit has a zipper that unzips constantly.  It is best to have the zipper on the bottom with the zipper pointing towards the ground to keep it from unzipping daily, but get this... they know about it, have created a unit with a better zipper, but it is not included in with the unit (you get the crappy cover w/unit)  You have to buy the improved unit separately; and the cover with the new improved zipper cannot be identified from the the older model by looking at it, or the package.  No ""New and Improved"" sticker or anything, so if you do buy the improved cover, you will not know if it is the new model until you handle the zipper.  It has a little bit better quality zipper with teeth that grab better and a little more firmness when you get to the end to lock it closed.

So, unless your dog always stays at home, and you have 2-3 acres of property for your dog, this GPS Trackers AREA and TRIP functions are next to useless.  The only possible benefit is to be able to recover the dog in a short amount of time until the battery wears out, and lets hope you know he is gone, because he will have a big head start before you get an alert, (if you have not turned off the OUT OF AREA ALERTS).

I will be looking for a better GPS device.  This was a hundred plus dollar waste of money.  The sad part is that these issues could have been fixed easily in the design phase.",0
Bought these as a gift for my wife and she loves them! It was amazing!! Thank you so much!!,1
Works well for itchy skin and smells good too. Who doesn't like a massage? The dogs line up for their turn.,1
The reviews said peoples' cats loved this so I took a chance and so far my cat avoids it no matter where I have moved it to and I have rubbed and rubbed the catnip all over it.,0
Reeks of latex and the smell doesn't go away. I had to throw them away.,0
Our cat is scared to go in this litter box,0
"Not great quality, not long enough so you have to bend over while scooping the poop, and if you're playing catch up on poop collection from a 90lb dog, that's a lot of bending.",0
Very nice tray,1
"I don't see how the minuscule amount of airflow provided by this thing is going to do anything, so I'm returning it. Some of the reviews say it works really well, but I can't clip it on my tank since the clips are too narrow, and I don't think having one of them sitting on top of my screen lid is going to help all that much. Plus, the 6-fan one is too wide to have on the side of my tank, so it has to go on the front or the back where it can't reach due to the electrical cord being pretty short. So... this thing is going back to China.",0
Size marked as L/XL barely fit my XL dog. He had it off within an hour of putting it on.,0
Absolutely LOVE! Our cat is ALWAYS on it!! Definitely worth the $$$,1
"There's a reason why they're under 1$ per pound. My dog gets rancid gas from these suckers. In a ten pound box there are about 40 bones. They're not worth the money, especially so if your furry friend has an extra sensitive stomach.  My greyhound does particularly well with Charlee Bear Liver Treats which are also inexpensive. They come in little dime sized wafers and don't cause gas. Milk bones are pretty hard so at best they're only reasonably broken in half.",0
"I had a Cosmic Pet Shuttle at one time which looked just like the photo and was happy to find it.  What I received is not Cosmic Pet Shuttle, but a random design pet carrier, and not as sturdy as the one I originally had.  Also it came in a box that was falling apart.",0
Have a dog with very sensitive skin. Switched from straight oil to this because of the smell and it has worked great and no oily mustache or fishy smell,1
The only way this product could get any better is if it included a gold chain.,1
"The raincoat by Thundershirt was well-made and sized appropriately.  However, the belly band was too wide, causing my male dog to soil it, no matter how I tried to strap it on.  I returned the coat as unusable, although it could have been a great product.",0
Incredibly hard. Like stone. My dog cannot get any grip or chew on these. She just abandons it.,0
Tuffy's Polly Pig Dog Toy is one tough piggy.  This is the 2nd one I have ordered.  The first lasted more than two years with a dog that is really tough on toys.  Would definitely recommend.,1
My dog won't eat it. Won't even smell it and it does smell like poo!,0
"I ordered it and received it in two day in a small size box. It came with one bag weighing 1(one) pound. This is a scam, theft or whatever you'd like to call it. DOES NOT MATCH DESCRIPTION. Regardless if you did receive the full order you can find a 20lb bad for 18 bucks at walmart.",0
Nasty paste. Smelled bad but it is dog food so I thought id give it a shot. My 2 year old Husky dug it out of the bowl and rolled it to a corner. Shes obvously unimpressed too. 1 Star becuase now i have a case of usless dog food.  She would have to be starving to be forced into eating it.,0
"I have a 2 year old mix who is a strong chewer (although he doesn't intentionally destroy toys) and he did this the first day I put food in. I'm still using the toy without the top but it just works a little differently then intended. I've had the cube feeder from StarMark for about a year now and I love it. They make quality puzzle feeders just be aware for the super heavy chewers that it won't hold up.

"nice quality, surprisingly. However I have a really hard time rolling up the top flap and fastening the button to secure it... seems that the fastener tab length isn't quite long enough, once I finally got it fastened I have not removed it as its too hard to fasten to begin with! But very cute and sturdy bag... my 9 pound puppy is comfy enough but quickly outgrowing it.",1
"No, this package is not the same as the other grain-free chicken model
I was completely fooled by the same color and the same brand.
My cat didn't digest it very well and had a diarrhea for couple days, she refused to touch them later. It's also very crumble for some reason.",0
"For the past 8 years I have tried feeding different types of cat food to my cat. The only food that he will eat is Purina Friskies Savory Shreds Wet Cat Food, beef shreds. I was hoping the Hills Science cat food would be different, but it wasn't. He wouldn't touch it, so I set it outside for the neighborhood cats to eat. It sat there all day, untouched. Next morning I tossed it and donated the rest of the package to the local animal shelter. I thought the cans were small, the meat pale in color, and rather potent in smell.",0
I didn't feel they were safe for puppies that tear them up and chew on them as mine does.,0
I was looking for a plain bone without anything inside of it. My dog loves this bone.,1
Good deal.,1
Needs a zipper or buttons. Otherwise a loose fit does not work with a leash.,0
"I spent lots of money on a cat tower last winter that he doesn't use.  This little gem, on the other hand, is completely worth it.  It's sitting on the corner of my bed (by the wall so it doesn't fall off) and has become his go to spot for daytime naps and nightly zzzs.  We give this four paws up!

Update
My cat will no longer go in the dream pod.  It still reeks of material used to make it, making me think that the cat has decided he'd rather lounge somewhere less odoriferous.",0
"I purchased 3 months supply for 5 dogs.  Today I put it on all 5 dogs, using the proper dosage for each dog.  One dog was immediately showing bizarre symptoms including slight gagging, tongue thrusts, and anxiousness followed by vomiting.  I dosed all 5 with benedryl and bathed the one who was so ill.  Have just finished bathing a 2nd who was excessively drooling and trying to rub the treatment off.  Keeping a close eye on the other 3.  I had high hopes for this product as we battled tick fever last year and lost one of our dogs to it.  But I will be tossing out this product.  I am much more upset about the trauma to my dogs than the money wasted.",0
When we love our babies we feed them the best. My lil Aiden loves this food: she ate kitten version when I rescued her and transitioned to the adult with no problems!,1
Perfect for my cat. Cute little fancy bowls. I get compliments on them often,1
"Worthless, I even gave it to my dad to try on his dogs.. Nope trash for him as well.. Sad as this looked promising..",0
"I have 5 cats & they all love the Pet Fusion Scratcher! One is a Maine Coone mix & on the large side, she loves to lounge on the scratcher as well as try to destroy it! It is heavy enough that it does not flip over no matter how rough she plays!",1
Great product,1
This container wasn't only a perfect fit for the kitchen but for the 25 lbs.of cat food we loaded into it.  Great product.  Fast shipping.,1
NOT THE SAME AS THE PICTURE.  VERY SMALL NOT EVEN STUFFED,0
I have a 50lb german shorthair pointer that had this toy destroyed in one day. These are NOT the KONG style toys. Made of soft rubber and not durable.,0
"When we recieved the package, the box was not opened, but the food package it was open. This should not be happening to customers.",0
"Our cat loved this from the minute I set it out.  He has always loved to lay on papers or anything that crinkles so I thought this would be a good fit.  The lights are small and red.  i wouldn't say they twinkle, they just turn off and on (all at the same time).  The only negative is that they don't stay on long.  They are motion activated but they only blink for a few seconds unless you move again.  I would have liked to see white lights and them stay on longer.  Our cat is fairly large-13 lbs- but he fit just fine.  Overall, satisfied with it.",1
"It worked for about a week before the fleas were back. I live in San Diego, CA where the fleas seem particularly tough.",0
We now have three of these. It's the best price I've come across for this size crate and they are simple to put together. The sides fold up and snap into place very easily. Definitely recommend.,1
"A great little dog tag with lots of space to put info on so if my dog ever gets lost, whoever finds him can send him home!  Great for us.",1
"Rarely worked when she barked and one time it kept stimulating her and I had to remove it and pull the battery to stop it, Junk I tossed it in the trash!",0
Make sure you double check this fits in your seat belt!!! Mine doesnt,0
"These work well for my older golden retriever and help to clean and minimize any smell, however they are not for younger dogs.  The container says not for dogs under 12 weeks old.  I used them on my 3 month old weimaraner and it causes his ears to become painfully inflamed and resulted in a double ear infection and a pricey vet bill.",0
Fantastic plus healthy dog treat,1
Great Shampoo for pugs with allergies!,1
Product was recommended by multiple members of my GSD rescue club.  I give my German Shepherd and foster dogs this product!  Keeping Hip dysplasia at bay.,1
"SOO great and so affordable! I will never buy dog toys from a pet store again, these are the same thing for way less!",1
"A lot larger than I thought it'd be. The cats like it, but the lower level condos go unused.",1
"This s*** itself is cute. However, it is ridiculously small. I ordered the XL for my 25 pound cocker spaniel based on the previous reviews and it was still too small. They sell it for under $2 so I'm pretty sure they make their money off the shipping. Really would have loved for it to fit him. Never buying from again :/",0
Cheap but does the job.  Just as good as the more expensive one,1
I use these for one of my finicky cats who won't pee in the litter box after having a bladder infection. She is trained to use the pee pads & will scratch till it is folded over. I put three down on top of one another & it works great!!,1
"Very disappointed. The blanket looks great and appears to be well-made - but it is in no way, shape or form waterproof or water repellent. I bought these sheets to keep the horses dry in the early stages of a storm system coming in - so I could then blanket them with a mid-weight as the temps drop into the 30s. Both of my horses wore these straight out of the bag and after a few hours of light rain, the blankets (and both of the horses) were soaked - not damp, soaked as if they had not been wearing blankets at all. Now I have wet horses whom I can't blanket with the heavier they need since they are soaked to the bone due to this sheet. BUYER BEWARE. I bought two, as I have two horses, and will repeat this review for that purchase as well.",0
"My cat has enjoyed playing with rabbit fur mice (he spent hours batting them around), so I was surprised when he clearly despised these toys. After a first cursory investigation he began going out of his way to avoid them. I checked for any obvious defects before throwing the toys in the trash. The fur is very soft and detaches with a gentle tug, dispersing everywhere. My cat's aversion to the things made me wonder what was actually inside.",0
"Great little water bowl for out and about.  Took a while to receive, but overall happy with it.",1
"it's a lovely shape and it looks very nice. but. the filter leaks and will have to be replaced. it's a 10 gallon tank filter for a tank that's just over half that size, much to strong. and too loud at first. and when it came with no assembly instructions or maintenance instructions included for the tank itself. and the light burnt out the second it was turned on. unless you absolutely adore the unique shape of it, don't waste your money. it is junk.",0
"Even with measurements, this harness did not fit my dog. (Not even close) and please note THIS ITEM IS NOT RETURNABLE UNDER AMAZON'S GUIDELINES. As I have 2 dogs, I'm now stuck with 2 harnesses that do not fit. :(  Please measure and re measure and then reconsider buying this item, because if it doesn't fit or you don't like it, you're stuck with it....",0
Poor quality after 2 months the eyes are falling out,0
If you have a rhodesian ridgeback this toy will not last!  Our doggie got this from Santa and it lasted until yesterday 12/27/16.  He was able to get it open and get the tennis ball out.....  Needless to say we are still in search of a tough toy for this guy!!,0
Only works for very short time. Too expensive for this limited use.,0
These beds are wonderful. The memory foam is very thick and dense and even our heaviest dog does not compress it all the way to the floor so it offers great soft support. She is old and has arthritis. When she sleeps in the bed I notice she limps a lot less. The cover is very soft. The bolster is just high enough for her to lay her head on which she loves to do. She is around a 100 lbs and can full stretch out Love this bed!,1
I like that it is vegan as well as organic. It might not be veganic though. It does have a pull tab to open  and it says adult formulated.,1
did not work dogs kept barking,0
"This item is great.  As it says, Makes your life easy, just need to refill.",1
Our puppies refused to eat them. I tried on 3 different occasions to give to our 2 dachshund puppies and our older dog and they smell them and walk away. On of the puppies picked it up for and I thought he was going to chew on it but he just spit it out and left it.,0
"Terrific value . Assembles very easily , and the cover zips on. I am using them for my small dogs to look out a window. Also can be used for getting on a bed.",1
"Bought this as a gift for my sister, and her cat goes absolutely crazy for it! For some reason she likes it a lot more than any of the other ""wand"" type of cat toys.",1
"I bought this for my bichon he has short little legs and has problems getting on and off our beds.  We bought a more expensive doggie steps from Amazon and they were perfect.  We needed another doggie step for another bedroom, so I decided to save a little money and go with this one, my dog wouldn't even go near it, he just went right around them and wanted to be picked up to be put on the bed.  I will say we have hardwood floors so that is one of the problems b/c since it is plastic they don't stay in place, they might work better if you have carpet.  But overall I don't recommend, I returned them.",0
Very disappointed in the quality.  Looks cheap.,0
"Dead on arrival. Returning. Something so simple should just work, right?",0
Product is great but HEADS UP!! This is a VERY SMALL bag. You'd pay $7-8 at a grocery store for.,0
Read the fantastic reviews but didn't notice any results after using two bottles. Had my vet give me a Rx of Rovera (carprofen) and noticed changes in my dog.,0
Works well,1
This toy smells funny and my dog does not like this toy.,0
"Dogs didn't like it, and I don't want them to fight me when tending to their teeth.  So I won't use it.",0
"I had recently had my first run in with fleas. On all 3 of our cats. I assumed BC my cat stays mostly away and in my room which is how she prefers it to be away from other cats and kids alike, I know she's an old cranky lady. Well, somehow she got them too. They were JUST AWFUL. I felt terrible for her. She's going on 20 now and I had to give her a flea bath to rid her of them. And I still didn't get them all. I had no idea how bad it really was. But I will say that during this flea bath, I didn't see any and then I guess the meds started drawing them out and I felt so bad for her, they were trying to get in her eyes and her snout and I felt so helpless trying to help my baby girl. I had used the Hartz (NEVER EVER AGAIN) THATS WHEN THEY GOT REALLY BAD. I didn't notice anything, no flea dirt no fleas nothing so as a precaution I put the Hartz on her. Bad idea. Worst idea. She got infested with them. Only until I put the front line in conjunction with the oral pills did I see DEAD fleas. They worked so amazing together and now I will use front line on her once every 2 months and the sentry capguard every week just to be sure. It worked at getting rid of them on ALL 3 of our cats. Now my girl is happy again and rid of those damn things. They were the WORST. Thank you front line !",1
"I was so hoping this would work for my German Shepherd, but for some reason, he had a terrible reaction to it. I had to call the vet the next day and was given instructions on how to wash out this soap.",0
"The coat took longer to arrive than I had anticipated which is not a problem, just a comment.  The coat runs small.  I ordered a Large for my 65 pound female German Shorthair.  It barely fit around her neck and the length of it was about 4-5 inches from her tail.  I have returned it and exchanged it for an Extra Large which should arrive soon.  4 Stars because I can't say for certain how well this one will fit and how well it will hold up to use.  Product appears to be well made.",1
Awesome.  Was nervous about it being too small for my  18# Shih Tzu.  Worked like a charm.,1
My elderly cats love this cat food.,1
"Probably one of the best dog costumes out there. Talk of the town. Although my dog didn't take too well to the headpiece, the suit is pretty awesome on its own.",1
"Frustrated with this product. Followed all instructions on bottle and on Dr. Tim's website for a new tank's fishless cycle (which claims that this supplement can cycle a tank in under a week). On day 12 of cycle now, and all my readings suggest that my tank is on a traditional cycling timeline as if I haven't added any bacteria at all. Maybe the bottle wasn't live after all. :(",0
"Vacuuming, lint rolling, and washing do nothing to remove the dog hair on this type of fabric. Fits in a standard size washer, but the fabric is that type that will hold on to all of the dog hair until it's dying breath. I have two other types of dogs beds that clean easily...It's just this particular fabric. Additionally, the stuffing likes to get lumpy and not spread out evenly after the first wash (not surprising). It's a fair price for a large dog bed, but it won't stay looking nice for more than a couple weeks.",0
"My dog's skin is so sensitive! If I don't keep her hydrated she gets really dry from rashes, scratching and dandruff. This product doesn't make her skin irritate like other cheaper flea meds have (especially the cheap ones from Walmart, they made her scratch all night until her skin broke and bled, never again). Plus, the medication lasts long and I never find fleas on her anymore  (I check constantly to prevent her from scratching so much). Even though this product is more pricey, but it works great. I haven't used any other product since I started with this one.
She's happy, I'm happy. :]",1
"Really top quality, and I love that you can adjust the amount of content delivered by moving the stop. This prevents the sudden delivery of much more food than intended if you squeeze too hard or lose grip. Great product and easy to clean.",1
"Literally just got this today and my 2 dogs ripped the tail open and got the squeaker out of it, and ripped holes in both feet within 2 hours of me giving it to them. They do love it though.....but a dog toy should last more than a few hours.",0
"Bought for a 15.1 Quarter horse, it rubs his shoulders raw and his pasture mate ripped it with in 15 minutes.",0
"This was the best solution for our larger Syrian hamster. The other expensive cages are too small for a hamster his size (he's normal size for a Syrian, but most cages are built for dwarf hamsters). The plastic shelves are as good as any from a cage and it fit perfectly on my daughter's 10 gallon tank.
My only complaint is that the wires are a little too flexible for me -- the hamster can bend them a little and I'm afraid over time that they might give -- only time will tell. Also, at the very bottom, the space between bars is a little wide. I don't think he will be able to get out, but we will keep an eye on it.
I still think it is the best solution for a Syrian or teddy hamster. It is only accessible from a door on the top of the cage, so if  you have young kids, it might be difficult for them to reach down. It was easy to out together, though -- my 12 year old did it alone, and it leaves plenty of room for a wheel or other items you may want in there, The water bottle that came with it sits a little low  to the ground and the hamster sometimes has to twist around to drink, so we may end up getting a clip to hang it from the cage.
Good buy, but would have given it a 5 if it were cheaper than the $30. Realistically, I feel its a $20 cage addition.",1
This makes life so much better! Our dogs wear 2 tags and we were constantly being woken up in the night when they would shake their heads.  With the quiet spot on we are all sleeping like babies.  The quiet spot is a must have!,1
Bought this at PetSmart in a pinch and my 3 cats are all scratching. Not a happy customer. Going back to Advantage.,0
This tag is sooo tiny. About the size of a dime. I don't know if I clicked the wrong button but it's not at all what I expected.,0
"This medicine is the best i have ever gotten for my dogs. i have a pit bull and a boxer. the pit has really bad allergies and our animal hospital recommended this to us. we have to do it multiple times a day but any ear mites, wax, yeast infections your dog has will go away after using this! not only after one use of course... we have been on this for about 2 years now, cleaning 1-2 times a day and the whole time she has been mite and yeast free!",1
Works!  And our picky eater seems to not notice it sprinkled then mixed into his food (we did add soft food to his meals to get this powder into his system.),1
"This product is great, but only initially. I bought 3 and 1 stopped working shortly after purchase. The company replaced that one. Now another one is also not working. So of the 4 they've sent me, only 2 remain working. That's a 50% fail rate on this product. They do respond to contact efforts and replace the defective items though.",0
"My German Shepard got extremely ill after eating this product.  She vomited profusely and drank enormous amounts of water which she too threw up.  This all happened within two hours of her consuming (2) 13 oz. cans.  Needless to say, I will never purchase this product again.  Be aware please.",0
"I thought this was a great idea and that I'd put my own foam rubber stuff in it. However, the underside was so thin the dog chewed a huge hole in it in about a half hour, which royally irritated me. I hate things falling apart before I've even paid the bill. Ugh!",0
"Measured very carefully and asked size opinions in my poodle group. But when I got the suit in, it just did not fit well at all. Cut into his shoulders. Also, theres only one snap on the back for potty purposes, that leaves one flap dangling which would just get peed all over.
Finally, also not suitable for neuter. My standard poodle is having gastropexy with his neuter so this wouldve been nice for the abdominal incision, but it didn't block the genitalia at all.",0
"As others have mentioned, this thing self inflates to a level that makes it like your dog trying to step onto a giant balloon or one of those yoga balls.  Not a comfortable place to sleep.  After some coaxing, I got each of my three dogs to try it out.  They got sick of trying to get it mashed down enough to lie down on it and now they won't even go near it.  If I mash it down first, they consider it, but this was a total waste of money.  All my dogs hate it and refuse to lie down in it.  They would sooner sleep on the hardwood.  Thankfully, there was a glitch in Amazon for the color I selected and I got an XL for $90.  After I bought, it went up to $170.  While Im glad I didn't pay full price (would have been furious), it still isn't even worth the $90 I paid.  I give an extra star for made un USA.  Also, full cleaning sounds like a pain.  Instead of buying their special bag, Ill probably just throw it out.  That is if it ever sees enough use that would require a cleaning.  Very disappointing.  Dogs don't want to sleep on a pilates ball, duh!!",0
Perfect size for my 12 pound dog and she loves them. Leaves her breath smelling great and her teeth clean,1
Perfect! Very well made and fits my little dog well. I love the way the sides are scooped out for her to be able to comfortably hang her head out!,1
Nice harness! It is adjustable and fits my small dog snuggly across the chest but is roomy around the neck so it doesn't bind.,1
"i bought this product for a 2500 sq ft house, says 1 can for 6000. put a can in each room, cleaned up and also used the spray. that night still had fleas, now they are worse than ever. i would never buy an adams product again.",0
Clumps really well but kicks up so much dust that hard to clean out the box and eventually contributed to a urinary tract infection.,0
broke within 3 minutes would not recommend,0
"Terrrible. Food doesn't dispense fully. I bought this a few yrs ago and it was a letdown from the beginning. The reason i bought this is because it had good reviews in the beginning, now everyone has the same problems as I do. It still works but I can't wait to get rid of it. I'm just waiting for a good manufacture before I spend money on a new machine. So far I'm eyeing Petsafe which has been getting great reviews as I've been studying for over a year now.",0

"I purchased two bottles of the Feliway spray and one of the plug-in atomizers in the hopes that this stuff would stop my neutered male from peeing on my bed whenever he sees another cat or wildlife outside.  No luck.  It is possible that he was able to detect a urine smell on the blanket underneath the deflated air mattress I'd put on top of my bed to protect it, but I doubt it, since the blanket was laundered 3 times using Arm & Hammer/Oxy detergent and Febreeze for laundry, then dried with a dryer sheet.

For others with this problem, I highly recommend buying a cheap, flocked-top inflatable bed and leaving on top of your bed deflated to protect the bed.  I use a Bissel Spot Bot (small carpet cleaning machine) with the upholstery attachment and hose to clean the air mattress when other cats or wildlife wander by.  It beats stripping the bed every time and is much less expensive and easier to clean than one of those crazy expensive waterproof pet blankets (the one big enough to actually protect my Queen size bed is far too big for my washing machine)!",0
"Love these soft and portable bowls! We bring them for our hikes and keep one in a car. Well made, highly recommended. For what you get you can't beat this price.",1
too small,0
"Chuckit, you are making my pup deliriously happy! If you'd just invent a ball that throws itself, now. She is wearing her chief ball thrower (yours truly) plumb ragged. Bought this medium ball for my larger pup (40 lbs) but the little 13 lb stray loves it, too, and is easy for her to carry because of the grooves.",1

Very well nourished with specialty food. Any ideas out there?",0

"Experience: one week

Pros: immediately, our dog walks perfectly and is happier than ever to go on walks with us.

Cons: none.

Overall: before finding the easy walk harness, we tried many other collars and harnesses but they all had their problems. The Gentle Leader was great, but our dog HATED wearing it and eventually chewed through the over-the-nose strap (thankfully, they will replace the strap for 1/2 the price of the Gentle leader). The easy walk harness is just as effective as the Gentle Leader, but without all of the heartache.",1

I'm not sure how long these will last but I would buy them again given how much they use and seem to enjoy them.",1
"My dog loves this toy. He sleeps with it. And plays with it. It's durable enough to play tug of war, and easy to throw. I'll get him another when this one wears out. But it's holding up pretty well, so I imagine it will be awhile.",1
I have 3 guinea pigs (whom I love with all my heart).. This has to be the best cost saver in food. It's such a huge bag!! I love it! My guinea pigs seem to love it too! Since I have to refill their food bowls twice a day! And they have two food bowls!,1

"Bought one to occupy my border collie's mind a bit. Not much of a puzzle, though. Once she figured it out the first time, it only took seconds to empty it on every subsequent occasion. Now she just picks it up, turns it over (so all the flaps open) and shakes it a bit so all the treats fall out!

Does seem pretty robust, though. And being all-plastic, it washes easily.",0
I've only used these when they were included with the purchase of a new LitterMaid litter box. They seem to have only a slight impact on odor levels.,0
Cat doesn't mind. Easy to use.,1
"Had the toy for less than 24 hours, and the first time my dog really played with this toy he ripped it open and it was ruined.  The toy feels tough and rugged, but it is no match for a dog with a powerful jaw.  I would have expected more out of a $2 dog toy, and this one was over $7.",0

"This is the 2nd collar I have purchased for my 7lb Yorkie. I Love It !!!!  As long as you keep it pretty dry, this collar works for the 8 mo. When I bathe my dog I just take it off. It is sort of hard to pull it loose, but not impossible. My dog went to the groomer yesterday, & as usual I took it off of her before she went in. BUT This time I didn't put it back on as soon as I picked her up, I WISH I HAD !!!!  Tonight she was sitting with me when I saw a flea !!!!  Only 24hrs without it on & she had fleas !!!  Well .. up the stairs we went, (Dawn dish liquid in hand) & bathed her twice !!!  Went back into the truck & got the collar & back on it went. She is due for a new one, that is why I didn't put it right back on. Plus the fact that it's winter & getting cooler. But we won't go without it any more !!!  I will also be purchasing 2 extra ones for my daughter's 2 dogs. My other daughter has 2 dogs as well, But being that they cost over $50 each ... it would be $250 !!! I tried finding a printable coupon online, but there isn't one unless you print it for a particular store. I want to get it on my local military base. But all of that aside, this collar IS Amazing !!!  When she has that collar on, no fleas or ticks !!!  I wish they would add something to prevent mosquitos. Not that I have seen her being bothered by any, but I don't have her outside too long without me. I also love this product because any of the topical meds always irritate her way too much to make it worth using it.",1

I have returned them and received a prompt refund. Judging from the good reviews, our package must have been a bad batch.",0

wonderful sweather,1
My dog had a really bad odor coming from her ears and I thought this product would help. At first it did but the odor of this product is so strong my dog went crazy with it. You can tell she was in tremendous discomfort and I felt bad to continue using it. I finally took her to the Vet who prescribed antibiotic drops since she had a very bad ear infection with multiple bacteria. The ear drops cost about the same as this product on 1800PedMeds and the infection is now gone. I think this product is way too strong in scent and may cause a lot pain and discomfort to your pet especially if its a really bad ear infection.,0
"This ball is visually very appealing to human consumers with it's bright contrasting colors and raised map of the world. Dogs are most likely more attracted to the minty fragrance emitted by the ball. Unfortunately, the colorful map of the world is NOT a securely affixed part of the toy and can EASILY be taken off the toy in a minute or two!! The inherent danger of this is what could happen to these pieces once they are dislodged. They could easily pose a choking or intestinal blockage hazard should they be ingested. My own experience was having an 10 week old Cavalier puppy dismantle this toy within 5 minute of my giving it to her!! This is a puppy who is a light to average chewer with a toy that its manufacturer labels with a five tooth rating for the highest durability :-( I purchased size ""small"" which is the appropriate size for a toy breed puppy. Fortunately, I was nearby and noticed the toy coming apart ... I shudder to think what might have happened had I not seen it. I reported this to Planet Dog Toys, however, they didn't seem very concerned ...  the woman  I spoke to had all the company's CYA statements down saying that with 'some dogs' this can happen ...there have been problems with a 'few' of the balls etc. This is NOT a toy I would recommend ...Buyer Beware!",0
"I have a 7yr (almost 8) yellow lab. He's a ball of energy and won't slow down. He's in really good health and gets a lot of exercise. But sometimes his energy gets the best of him and will tweak something when playing too hard and limp for a few days. Our vet says that in his back legs he has some early arthritis, something his high energy level doesn't help. Nothing to treat yet, just to do preventive measures. I asked about supplements that could help, we already have him on glucosamine, MSM, and other joint supplements. She recommended this product and said she's seen this help a lot of dogs.

We've had him on this for about 2 months and have seen a noticeable improvement. He's quicker to get up and lay down and his movement is great!  Plus he LOVES the taste, he knows the sound of the top unscrewing and runs right over to get his treat. Knowing Labs history with hip/leg problems we will keep him on this so he can move and be his energetic self for as long as possible.

I would highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to help with their dogs energy and mobility.",1
"I wish I had given these the 5-star review they deserved back when they had the old formulation, because now I feel guilty for giving them a 1-star rating after having given them to my four dogs every day for the past few years, but folks need to be warned.  I had a ""subscribe and save"" subscription for these for a few years, but the most recent shipment came in a bag instead of a box and they were as hard as rocks.  As other recent reviews have stated, they went grain free and must not have tested them much, because it's hard to believe someone would approve these as worthy of any animal's mouth.  I used to be able to break one of these biscuits in half with one hand (which I would do when feeding them to my smaller dogs), but now I can't break them using two hands.  I took one and smashed it against my granite counter a few times and nothing happened until the third hit when a small shard flew off of the biscuit.  I'm not kidding or exaggerating.  I called Wellness and they said they've gotten a lot of complaints, so hopefully they'll adjust the formula and make them more mouth-friendly, and not so absolutely perfect for your gravel driveway.",0

They've played with it twice now, and it seems to be holding up just fine.  I've only used the feather attachment which probably won't last long with their long claws, but there is also the mouse tail attachment which I haven't tried yet.

I would definitely recommend this.  These two don't play well together and as you can see in the video they are playing nice together.",1
6month havanesse puppy destroyed the rope in less than a day very poor quailty,0
"We've had this drinking fountain for the best part of a year now and while we're pretty pleased with it overall it's not quite deserving of a perfect score.

First the good points. Wow, but does it do the job we bought it for. I've been a cat owner my whole life and I know that cats tend towards not taking in enough fluids and being a bit fussy about where they drink. If I had a dollar for every time I down put some fresh clean water from the tap only to find the cat drinking out of the scummy, algae ridden garden pond... well, I'd probably only have about twenty or thirty bucks to be honest, but you get my point. Our current cats weren't quite that bad but did have a tendency to get the water in the dish a bit skanky in a fairly short time, either by going straight from the food dish to the water and dropping food in it or by insisting on licking the water up the opposite side of the dish and shedding hair into the rest of it. A water fountain with a filter that would trap foreign matter and recirculate fresh, clean water constantly seemed like a possible solution, but when one of our cats became ill with some kind of gastro complaint that meant she couldn't keep food down and risked dehydrating from not drinking enough to make up we just had to try something. Our local pet store suggested this fountain since it offered the large dome for cats who like to lick water off a surface and a bowl with varying depths for cats who like to lap from a pool, and as we have cats of both kinds we bought one. After some initial curiosity and cautious inspection our cats, including the sick one, began to drink. And drink. And drink. They absolutely loved it. I've never had cats go through this much water and our current mob never used to drink this much until the Catit fountain arrived. It literally changed them overnight, and most importantly it persuaded the sickly cat to drink enough water to stay hydrated until she got better again. On top of that I'm sure the extra water they're drinking is good for all of them generally. It's a pretty good size for us too. Not so large that it gets in our way but large enough to keep a few days worth of water for four cats that have suddenly all found a renewed interest in drinking, and I'm sure the claims that it would be suitable for a smallish dog are probably true.

Maintenance wise it's okay too. Our cats tend to drink enough for it to need refilling about every 4-5 days, which unfortunately doesn't fit in well with the manufacturer's recommended weekly dismantle and cleaning schedule but it doesn't do any harm to give it a cursory rinse during the mid week refill without actually dismantling it properly. The dismantling process isn't a big deal. The dome lifts off the grey base (more on that point later) and opens up to be cleaned by unscrewing a wheel on the underside. The spring loaded valve that automatically lets water out of the dome to top up the base is a simply twist and pull affair. The pump cover is a snap-on/off job that allows the impeller to be cleaned. The dome and base are large enough that you probably want the drainer clear first, but since almost every part is designed to be wet more or less permanently you really don't need to worry about drying anything apart from the sides and underneath of the base and the flower shaped handle that screws into the top of the dome. The whole cleaning process takes about ten minutes and the only thing I'd say to be aware of is that plugging the sink first is a must so you can't lose the smaller parts down the drain.

So, five stars from our cats and looking after the thing isn't too much of a chore, but what are the downsides? Well, first off it's not what I'd call cheap (at least not here in Australia). This would be fine if it felt pretty durable but unfortunately the plastics it's constructed out of are a tad on the soft side. As a result the wear on some areas just from dismantling it for the manufacturer's recommended weekly clean has reached the point where some things don't really fit together properly anymore. The two areas affected are not critical - one is a lug on the underside of the dome's base, which is supposed to retain the wheel that opens and closes the dome, and the other is the threads on the flower shaped handle that screws into the top of the dome. That the wheel now comes off is not serious because it simply pushes back into place again, but those worn threads on the handle have made it virtually useless for anything apart from making the top of the dome look pretty. You're supposed to lift the whole dome on and off the base by this handle but with ours it's simply not safe to do so anymore. Don't get me wrong, it won't blow up or cause any injuries or anything, but there's got to be a couple of litres of water in there and the handle just can't take that much weight anymore. If we tried I can see the dome getting dropped and broken, and that makes the handle as much use as an inflatable dartboard. There is a warning in the manual about not over tightening it and this should be taken very seriously. Or better yet just do what we do: don't bother using the handle to lift the dome and instead just switch the fountain off, stick a thumb in the hole and lift the dome a bit like you would a bowling ball. Because of that the now useless handle is not much more of an issue than the worn lug on the base, but it's an annoyance. For what the thing cost we shouldn't be having to find workarounds due to cheap, crap plastics. The only other niggle we have is that the pump is prone to surging from getting tiny amounts of air in it even when there's still plenty of water. Again, more a nuisance than a big deal since fixing it just involves topping up the water in either the base, the dome or both, or just cleaning the whole fountain if it's getting near that time anyway. Still, it'd be a better product if the pump was designed so that it only surged when the water was really low, which is what the manual suggests should happen. The only other downside, if you can even call it a downside, is that like some other users we've found that the small food bowl that attaches to the side just encourages our daft cats to drop more food into the water. Okay, this is really the cats' fault but I felt I ought to mention that because of this we gave up on the food bowl bit very quickly (which is also a bit small for four cats anyway) and went back to their old dish placed a foot or so away from the fountain.

As I've said none of these problems are serious and with a cheaper purchase price I might even be inclined to give them a pass. As it is I feel the design is great but the quality of the finished product doesn't quite live up to it, and that's a bit of a let down really. Would I recommend it to anyone else? Well, yes, but to be honest not without pointing out the caveats I mention above. It's a pretty good fountain, really it is, but it's one of those products that could have been five stars but falls short because of a few cut corners. I'd probably rate it maybe a 3.5 out five but I'm prepared to split the difference with the high satisfaction rating given by our cats' reaction and regular use of it. Between us the moggies and I are calling it a solid four stars.",1
Didn't like item cheap not what i expected,0
"This toy is wonderful. It has held up well and Maxwell loves it. Its a good size toy for a dog in the 30-60 pound range. I don't consider Maxwell to be an aggressive chewer. If you have a hardcore chewer, then this toy will suffer the fate of many like it. It is not indestructible or made of a super hard material. Max loves to play hard, tug-o-war is the best and this toy is great for that.

I think it might last 6-12 months with my boy. And that is pretty good considering we play hard.

Pros: Fun and well constructed
Cons: Not steel .. but I didn't expect it to be
Value: Yes, high value for the price.
Recommend: Yes, I would suggest that you consider getting this one!",1

"Thanks to these pill pockets, my dog associates the sound of a rattling tablet bottle with yummy treats.  She sits up and begs whilst I am hiding the tablet inside the pill pocket.  It's wonderful to be able to give my dog her medication without any stress or upset.  I was even able to hide two different tablets inside one pill pocket.

The pill pockets are quite soft and easy to fit the tablet inside.  My dog is generally not too difficult to give tablets to - I can also hide them inside a piece of cheese, meat, or some other yummy snack.  I prefer to give them to her in these pill pockets because I'm sure it must be healthier for her than feeding her too many human treats.",1

No grains, no white potatoes, no corn.

Comes in a heavy, completely sealed mylar bag, great if bugs or moisture are a problem where you keep your food. If you get ants in the summer like we do, the sealed mylar is a very welcome package.",1

Fits perfectly for my fur babies..they loved the bells too. Definitely suggest and would order again!!,1
"We were very happy with this product. Our small dog has been eating it for about two weeks and her coat and overall health is quite good. She eats it eagerly, surely due to the chicken content.

Something that we especially like is that the product comes in quite small pieces. This is definitely the right thing for small breeds, and encourages her to eat at a more reasonable speed (to the extent that any dog will eat slowly, at least).

The only question could be economy. Certainly you can buy less expensive food. But when you figure the benefits vs. the cost per serving, it seems worth it. At one cup a day, a bag lasts a while.

Overall: a good product that seems nutritionally balanced and well manufactured.",1
The best I've seen works great . My toy dog had worms for months try pills .try powder dewormer still had worms .gave this product two times and it's gone amazing product all natural .no poison or chemicals God made,1
works great. my cats love it.  great quality with no compromise.  i would have given it 6 stars,1
"My wife and I have 3 indoor cats who are picky about their food. When it comes to wet food, they typically prefer shredded meat in sauce/gravy above everything else (chunky/pate are a no-no). I have given them different brands of wet food in the past and recently introduced them to the Wellness Signature Select shredded variety in sauce. It was an absolute hit. The bowls were licked clean in minutes. The can has a healthy portion of sauce which my cats really liked. Their reaction during feeding time every subsequent day has been a clear indication of how much they enjoy eating this wet food. I personally liked the ""inverted"" can design. The premium price  point seems to be on par with other brands such as Blue Buffalo Wilderness line.

Pros: Cats love it, No meat buy-products.
Cons: Price

What my cats eat:
Wetfood: Wellness Signature Selects Shredded White Meat Chicken and Turkey Entre in sauce / Wellness Signature Selects Shredded White Meat Chicken with Chicken Liver Entre in Sauce.
Dry food: Blue Wilderness Indoor + Blue Wilderness Duck Recipe",1
easier to order on line than go to the store. works very well,1
"The item looks great and arrived just fine.  Our dog just isn't interested in it, which is disappointing given that its a rather expensive ball.  She likes to chew on balls so perhaps this is one she cant chew easily; thats a good thing if your dog will play with it in other ways, but I guess our mutt just isn't a fetch kind of girl.",1
"My cat had one exactly like this before and it lasted forever.  He loved it.  So I was so happy to find it at Amazon.  The afternoon that it arrived I hung it up and my male cat was so happy.  Within 2 hours he had removed all the feathers, a hole in the bottom sprung open, stuffing came out and it then fell off the elastic cord.  Horrible quality.  I am beyond disappointed.",0
My dogs loooove it.. definitely worth it,1
Absolutely disappointed as the light stopped working the same day we got it and my puppy loved it.,0
I have a Pioneer Fountain - and this is the filter for it. It works as expected.,1
The absolute best dog door I've ever seen. I am sure I will be saving quite a bit in energy costs and this door his far better made than our old dog door. The quality is impressive and it was easy to install. I highly recommend this dog door to everyone!,1
"It worked fine until the battery ran down--or maybe it just stopped working for some other reason. Anyway, even with a new $9 battery, won't work on the dog. You can still hear a beep when you press a button to test it, but that's all. Does not pick up sound (bark) anymore, nor does it work when you shake it. It used to make sounds when the dog would shake. Now, nothing. Oh, well...",0
"Squeeker was chewed and ripped out within five minutes.  Definitely not a durable toy.
Next time will stick with the Zogoflex.  After a year of heavy play the zogo is still not chewed to pieces.",0
"It seems very safe and I love the color (red), but it seems heavier than other collars... I think my cat is used to the weight now, but I don't think he appreciated it very much at first.  Also, after just a week or so, it got scruffy and developed fuzz balls all over (similar to what happens to sweaters). This is most likely from my cat trying to rub his scent everywhere, but other collars that he's had didn't get like that.",0
Velcro didn't hold. Fell off adult black labs paws within minutes.  Lucky we recovered all four. Wouldn't recommend at all.,0
"We have 3 sun conures in this house. Mom,dad and baby all seem very happy. Easy to clean love the latch on front door they can't escape( which they are all very good at) piece missing when it arrived I contacted seller we had the piece in a few days. Would use seller again!",1
My dog loves it.,1
the 1.5 cup line is the bottom lip that touches the handle. sound confusing? it is. i bought this so i would have a fast and accurate way to measure my dog's food - it is neither fast or accurate. style points for being shiny and well made.,0
"These look great out of the box, but be warned, they are not strips of pressed rawhide like ones i have bought in the past.  They are made of small,  pressed chunks, encased in a thin outer shell of  rawhide strips.  You have to watch your dog VERY carefully because he will be able to chew hard chunks out of the center of the bone, defeating the purpose of buying the pressed bones.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I would not purchase these again.  BTW, I don't have strong chewers, either -- a25# poodle and 9# terrier mutt.",0
Broke after a week,0
This thing is carp after a month it burnt out .,1
Dog destroyed it as soon as it was out of the packaging. Didn't last 10 minutes. Waste of money.,0
"Great quality. .Never leak thru. They do tare, but very good quality.",1
"So far so good. I have been having issuses finding a good harness for my dwarf rabbit. She is supper fluffy and a little chubby but still small so I got the small size and it seems to work perfectly. I have only tested around the house and I haven't pulled on the leash much but the material seems much better then I have seen some other places. I am super hopeful.

I plan on taking her to the park when she is trained well enough. I can't wait!",1
I have always loved this product and one that we bought years ago is still working to this day. But one of 2 that I did have blew so I decided to get another one. It worked for a week and shorted out on me! I do not know if it was just this particular product but I never had problems until I received this one from Amazon. To say the least I am very disappointed.,0
Great product.,1
Not worth the cash. Cheaply made controller broke on a drop of 2 feet on to dirt.,0
battery was dead and needed replacement when i got it!!,0
The scracher is too light.  As my cat tryed to clawed the verylight weight scratchpad tne box just slipped off to the side.  Tbis frustrated my cat.  He stopped trying to scratch it.,0
The way to attach a blade is to turn the cutter on!  That's just nuts.,0
Waste,0
"Been waiting about 2 weeks to write this review to confirm that the product worked with no issues.

Thankfully, it took care of the problem.

I mixed it in with her meal and no after effects.

Update 2/20/2017:

Unfortunately, my dog got hit with it again.  Thankfully, I gave her a 2nd dosage a month later and this product did the job again.",1
Have been using this dish for less than a month and already it has a one inch crack down the side! Poor quality. Cannot recommend. Wish I could get my money back.,0
"Crystal clear water in 2 days!  My 40 gallon just would not clear up.  My other tanks are so clear, and this one just looked terrible in comparison.  Before a water change, I couldn't see the back of the tank.  I even removed and changed the gravel and decor, no help.  I purchased this UV sterilizer, and literally within 2 days, the water was clear as a bell!  My only complaint is that it is quite large and cumbersome, but I'll take that over milky white water!!",1
Not with the money for me. The poles fall down as they are light weight plastic and there are no weights what so ever. Would not recommend.,0
I have a sneaking suspicion these treats orritTed my pups skin. Once I started giving him these treats he started getting what always seemed like acne or bumps on his belly and groin. After I stopped giving him the treats his skin returned to normal about a week later.,0
It says xtra large yet this shirt could hardly fit my cat! I needed this for a puppy who needs a home and now I have to find someone else.,0
my iguana likes it,1
Bought for my MIL and her dog who is almost 90 pounds and jet black. Does the best job to light him up and neighbors took notice and would ask her where she got the light up collar. Now if something should startle her dog on their walks in the evening or early morning when it's still dark out....she will be able to see where he goes. And passing cars can see that she is walking her dog!,1
My dog wouldn't chew it.,0
I buy these monthly as our dog loves them.,1
Stella & Chewys is an amazing raw food that I give my cats as a treat and to prevent diarrhea and promote good health in general. I ran an animal rescue for years and saw amazing results using it.,1
"Came apart at the seams in five minutes, junk.",0
"I have a heavy weight dog, a Bernese Mountain Dog, but she'd rather have a homemade dog treat. I will be giving this to my nephew for his German Wire-haired Pointers. They love this type of toy. Thank you.",1
"All this product. Is is an outside filter witha hose sock attached, great invention. Never pick up much of anything. Constantly had to empty. The hose or dilter because it was clogged. Didn't. Notice a difference, waste of money.",0
My pet refuses to take the chew just due to the smell. She wouldn't even lick it!,0
"After reading the reviews I was ready for the large piece to be a bit smaller than what I assumed. My assumptions were wildly incorrect. I thought the ""large"" would have fit nicely in a 10 gallon tank, but it barely reached half the length. Thankfully the ""large"" looks great in a 5 gallon.... I'm not impressed with the size but the wood itself is rather beautiful.",0
My ferrets love them.,1
This was given to someone who just loves it.  Works great when she wants to walk her chicken and chicken does not mind at all.,1
"I wanted to love this adorable cage for our new dwarf hammy. I tried for 3 days. Today I had to go buy a new one. IT IS AWFUL. At first our new friend kept getting stuck in the wheel and when he finally figured out how to get out he decided to bring all of his food to the ledge of the connecting tube. Being a rodent, he's not the cleanest of eaters so much of his food ended up falling off of the ledge into the wheel. He then decided that he was gonna start pooping in the wheel. He then decided to use the wheel as a wheel.  The now broken and chewed food and now poop ended up flying around the wheel with him. Not bad you say? The entire wheel has slits in it and allows the food and tiny turds to escape. In the 3 days we owned it we had to clean out the HARD-TO-DISASSEMBLE wheel 8 separate times as well as the surrounding area (the table, my sons bed, the floor). This last time we couldn't even get it apart and it eventually ended up snapping at one of the latches. I should also mention that because most of his eating and pooping was taking place in the wheel and the tube connecting it that it STUNK (another reason we had to keep cleaning it).  I'm returning it tomorrow and ended up getting a 10 gallon aquarium with an attachable lid that allows tubing to be added. I'm over the plastic cheap crap that smells.",0
"My cat with a chronic upper respiratory infection that did not respond to many different treatments, this actually worked!  She is playing and chasing now.  I rescued her four years ago and this is the first time she has been infection clear.  Vet said use it for 2 weeks and then as needed after that.",1
"I initially chose to buy on Amazon this time because it was a lot cheaper, but I know why now. The food I received a couple weeks ago is now growing mold inside the bag. Its stored in a dry, normal temperature room on the first floor. I checked the expiration date and it says it expires at the beginning of next month, which possibly explains why it was making my kitty sick. I may try Purina again, but I will definitely buy it from the pet store.",0
My puppy loves this toy!  Hours of fun.  One of the few stuffed toys he doesn't try to rip to pieces. The kids love stuffing the mere cats back in for him to pull out again.  Keeps him busy.,1
too small for our dog,0
Excellent product. Will definitely purchase again from this company,1
Best toothbrushes for dogs out there!,1
"Within a month, the pad no longer works.",0
Great toy for the price!  Not really heavy duty -- my dog chewed through this in a matter of 2 days...but he really enjoyed those two days haha!,1
"Looks good, but be aware that the dimensions are for the EXTERIOR.  I have to return this and go up a size.",1
The product its no the same a the picture. Insiste don't have a capa to protector the filter,0
does not work. don't spend money on like products to save a few bucks. cost us more since the flees spread bad!,0
Was so happy when thus arrived. But quickly turn very unhappy when I opened it. The corners were broken caused from packing the parts in the whole bottom. I think they for got it was plastic. Had to run out to a pet store and buy a new one quickly for Christmas.  inconvenient Me a lot,0
My wife and I purchased this for our 5 month old pug puppy. He is around 11 to 12lbs and pretty slim for now (hopefully he stays this way). We purchased the medium size and it is great.  He was able to escape out of the harness that we purchased from the pet store.  It seemed that we either needed to get him a harness that was way to small or risk him escaping during walks.  This fits him perfectly and now I no longer fear that he'll get into the road when I take him for walks. The measurement guide was accurate and the review talking about measuring the head is important as well.  Make sure to measure their head as well as neck and chest as you need to be able to put this over there head.  Many of the other harnesses just attach over their back.  This makes the Puppia much more secure.  Great product!!,1
Wow!  Why did I wait so long to buy?  Pretty and warm!  Good hardware and good construction.  Thanks!,1
"So much better than the plastic ones.  Does not bang, holds bags well.  I did not have trouble inserting the bags.",1
Dispenser bottle clogs easily.,0
"Finally a food my dog loves! Thank you. Love the ingredients!
Hopefully the shiny coat and digestion benefits work out. I just started feeding this.",1
My pup loves these.,1
My pups skin seemed to dry out after one use,0
"We purchased this product when we brought home a dog from the SPCA.  We liked the design and the options. Our dog was fine with this kennel for about two months. Then he decided he wouldn't stay in the kennel when we left the house. At first I thought that we must have forgotten to close the cage correctly. But after several escapes and some chewed up shoes we figured out he was definitely the problem.

From what I can tell, the way the latches are designed, our dog was able to nose them down when he's also pushing on the door. You can't push them down with direct downward pressure. If you flex them towards the outside of the kennel, the latch part moves enough that it can be pushed down. Because the kennel has doors on either end and a side door we tried to block the ends of the kennel and just use the big side door. The latches for the side door are not accessible from inside the kennel so i figured that should do the trick. No such luck.  The first time we came home after the switch he had popped the side door off its tracks and was sitting on the couch.  Needless to say, if your dog is an escape artist, this kennel is not the best choice.",0
"Very fragile, do not hold up for my rottie",0
Dog love this thing,1
Cheap.  Fell apart immediately.  Don't waste your time.,0
wish you made these combos in more colors so i could buy more,1
"I would give this zero stars if I could. It came in a destroyed huge box, and the litter box itself was completely bashed in and unusable. A complete piece of trash.",0
"I let everyone try this out. Don't hesitate to buy, your dog will thank you.",1
"I purchased this product hoping to reduce the barking from my 3 maltese when someone comes to the door.  It worked well for that, however, it began going off even without me pushing the button.  Even if it was just sitting in our kitchen drawer it would go off and my dogs would get upset and run away.  I have no control over this device and I have to give it a poor recommendation.",0
"I am an experienced salt water aquarium hobbyist and have built and used many skimmers. This design intrigued me for the rpice so I bought one and tried it. First off, the collection cup is not vented. You get it dialed in so the water level is where you want it and you then open up the top cap and it overflows due to the pressure being released. The pump is under powered for a body this size and it does not make near enough bubbles. The tall tube that the water runs thru before the chamber is ill conceived. It reduces the amount of bubbles actually in the body.
 I was never able to get it to hold an adjustment level and it ran for day without making ANY skim-mate at all. This is on a well established reef tank. My other skimmer pulls lots out of it. But this one Nothing. I returned it and bought a Coralife Super Skimmer 125 for $150. That is a great skimmer and I would recommend it. This one, not so much.",0
"Sturdy and has just enough room for my puppy.  The door gives easy access to go in and out.  I would recommend getting the 2-panel add-on, the playpen has a lot more room!  Great value!",1
"I love blue buffalo, but my dogs aren't a fan. They seem to always opt for Iams. When given the option of eating blue buffalo or iams, they always run for the iams and leave the expensive BB out untouched. Might not have as many benefits as BB, but I can tell you that my dogs prefer it.",1
Our 2 lb Yorkie puppy climbed out after 10 minutes of use. Waste of money.,0
"Product is completely useless will not calibrate to PH water, even though it comes with 3 different solutions so that the user can calibrate it and be shure its doing what it needs to do. For the price this product was a rip off!!! Very disappointed..",0
Good for the price dog seems to like it very much.  Though she likes chewing on it more lol. She loves laying on it n sleeping too,1
I'm not sure this product really works.. I tried using it in areas that I knew it should pick it up but instead it just highlighted things  like paper etc.. not impressed,0
Not for aggressive chewers. My pitbull ripped this open and destroyed both balls in under 5 minutes.,0
junk ..will wet right through..useless!,0
"Lots of moisture.
Notoriously picky cat LOVES it!
I got a reasonable price with a coupon, so I alternate this with the cheaper stuff to make it last.",1
"I bought this because of all of the great reviews. My ShihTzu has a very sensitive stomach and lots of food allergies. This food appeared to meet all of her requirements. However, she will not touch it for love nor money! I have hydrated it exactly per the pkg directions and it always appears slimey, though I don't think that's what bothers her...it has a very strong smell like... herbs?, but this dog usually eats anything you put in front of her, though she can't eat just anything, and she took one smell and left the room! It was mixed with her regular Freshpet Vital to change her slowly, and I even tried to feed it by itself.  We live in HI, so wet food can't be just left in the bowl, it will go rancid quickly.  I left it for 2 hrs, threw it away, gave her fresh at the next feeding, and she left the room again. She did not eat for 2 days so I quit trying. Just as soon as I put her regular food in the dish, by itself, she devoured it...after not eating for 2 full days!! Was only looking for an alternative, because after 3 months on the Fresh pet Vital she began to scratch her ears again. She gets absolutely no grains and only organic treats with limited ingredients. Anyway,  I'm not at all happy with this purchase and would like to return it, but the shipping makes it a losing proposition. So I will just NOT buy any more dog food on line!",0
Came out of package and some rhinestones were already off..Would not recommed to buy it,0
My feral cat gave it an A+++ rating during the coldest temperatures of the years - mid to low teens. I put in in her little house and she stayed put! I like that the heat source is pressure activated and does not remain on constantly.,1
"Design and sturdiness are as good as ever, but we'll be switching back to the bacon flavor because out dog surprisingly doesn't seem to love the peanut butter flavor as much",1
"This is my second Pet Gear Generation II soft crate and it sets up as easily as my first one, which is still in use. I bought this for my Golden Retriever now that she has begun traveling to Agility trials.
(Of course all my dogs are crate trained - it drives me crazy when I read bad reviews for soft crates from idiots who buy them for untrained puppies or dogs, then complain about the dog escaping from it and/or destroying it.)
This particular crate has the fastest set up of any brand and all my dogs are very comfortable in them.",1
My kitties figured out very quickly how this worked. So they just took the tail out and ran a away with it.  The cape is flimsy and cats take it off very easily.  Don't waste your money.,0
bought this because my dog had acid reflux and was supposed to help. Made things way worse,0
Great product. My dogs love this so much.,1
I love Loofa dogs.  So does my bullmastiff puppy.  I bought this for an 8 week old pup and she has loved it the most out of all her toys to this day.  It held up relatively well.  The fabric is thin so an aggressive chewer would destroy it in no time.  She loves toting it around all over the yard and house and finally pulled the threads out in the back and gutted it after a couple months.  I will buy another one for her.,1
my dog loved these,1
"I tried a few premium cat foods with my cat, particularly Iams and Nutro Natural Choice, but was put off when both brands were affected by the Menu Foods Recall.  I chose Natural Balance because of its wholesome formula (4 of the first 5 ingredients are meat; also has chicken broth), no glutens, by-products or digests.

I tried one of every can of cat formula under this brand and found the others a bit on the dry side.  Natural Balance Ultra had a nice moist texture and didn't dry onto the bowl before my cat had a chance to finish his meal.  He cleans his plate consistently and has maintained his weight since I adopted him.  His coat is shiny and silky, with no dandruff and little shedding.  It even contains dried cranberries to maintain urinary tract health.

Overall, I like this cat food and would recommend it to others.",1
Broke the first time I went to clean it.,0
Trying to replace another alligator from this company - this one is not as long so not exactly what we wanted but a good toy still,1
"My dog goes nuts for these plush ducks.  The larger Mallard Duck is fantastic as well and has a more genuine ""quack"" sound than just a squeaker, which this one has.  The toy holds up well considering the abuse it takes.  The seams are tight and it takes a while for my dog to inevitably get into the stuffing.",1
Es diferente al producto ofertado y comprado.,0
Great leash! We use this many times daily with a 120 lb dog. Retraction has not failed us yet after 8 months of use!,1
"You get what you pay for! this whistle came apart about 3 weeks after purchase.. I lost a piece and could not put back together. In addition, I could hear clearly the whistle!  Not effective.. sorry..",0

"My basset hound has been dealing with yeast issues in her ears for a while.  Tried meds that our vet prescribed and the yeast was somewhat controlled, however, never completely went away.  That's why I purchased EcoEars.  After 5 days of using EcoEars, not only is the yeast infection back in full force, she now has ulcers in her ears.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!",0
"Sending back for refund.  I had lost the no name pair I have used for 14 years now, so I checked reviews and these looked perfect.  I was excited to try them out only to find like a few others have said, the pair I got were dull.  They crushed and cracked my dogs nails, you could even see the nails side walls flexing as you squeeze to cut.  They really needed cut though so I used them to slowly nibble tiny pieces and layers off until I gave up.  I later finally found my 14 year old pair and finished cutting the nails with no problems.",0
Good quality but it does not work!,0
"Had this for a while now and this has been a great dog bed for camping. Durable, light, easy to clean, compact for storing. My dog took to it from the very first day it arrived.",1
"Well made and full-looking plant, and very easy to install because of the weighted base.  The only potential drawback was that it is made of plastic and I was afraid that it may hurt the fish but they seem to like it.  I did cut out a few of the inner leaves and pull it open a little to give the tetras some room to hide.",1
says Ultra Silent but it's very noisy,0
The best scratching post I have had. Looks expensive and wasn't and my cat loves it. He claws the heck out of it and we have had it for a year and looks brand new. Highly recommend.,1
Tried this thinking since it was larger than the banana Voodoo would like it better. He did not. Wait for the banana 3 packs to go on sale. It's a better deal.,0
These diapers do not work for a male dog.,0
Our dogs love this food.  We mix it with another low calorie food and so far this is working out great for our three dogs.,1
"The small is really small, so unless your dog is the size of a guinea pig, I would advise against the small. Also the bottom is made of a cheap vinyl, so you would have to put a blanket or wee-wee pad inside for it to be comfortable. The only plus, is that it is really cute. It's way too small for my puppy, but I'm not going to pay to ship it all the way back to China, I'm going to give it away as a gift to my friend who has a really tiny 2 pound mini-pincher puppy.",0
"My dog is a beagle and this toy (Large) did not endure 1 minute. In less than a minute the squeaker stop working.

it is a beagle not even large nor aggressive breed.

very poor performance/quality",0
The system is difficult to use and to transfer control between collars.,0
It is simple and does what it is supposed to. No complaints here. ( Plus it looks cool lol ),1
My dog had an allergic reaction to this product.,0
My little Chi loves these! He is SO picky when it comes to snacks. I get him all kinds of cookies and treats which he eats one and then turns his nose up. But these he eats all the time and gets so excited when I pull out the bag! I am ordering more..,1
We trained our dog to use this in less than one week. It comes with an instructional video on how to train your dog but we did not use it. Whenever my dog wants to go out he rings his bell. He used to scratch my door when he wanted to go out and he ruined it. Having this bell is saving him from destroying the new door. It also really impresses all of my guests when my dog rings the bell.,1
Dogs like these. Wish it were less pricey.,1
So far so good!  Looks good in the tank and fish are hiding in it.  Snail magnet though.  Helpful to capture them...will have to see if the moss survives not being watched over a weekend.,1
My dog chewed it within 10 minutes..,1
"Great product! My dog gets very excited every time, I open the cabinet where the pig ears are kept.",1
"This toy is very bouncy but did not last an hour on the ""Chewy"" phase with my 12 lb. dog. Don't buy as a chewy toy!",0
Seem to work well--not dogs' favprote though,1
"The chain in my opinion, is not strong enough for  a large breed dog. I would not trust it to not break on a dog over 100+ pounds",0
"Doesn't spin, what's the point. I could have tied a feather to a sting and saved the money.",0
Like the easy clean mechanism which works well but the bristles are to hard/evil (?) for my kitty. He  now prefers my brush which you can purchase on amazon also the vizeri beauty boar bristle brush. This is what happens when your cat thinks it's human and you order both brushes in the same shipment!,0
"Not made for a fat cat.  Works perfect for mine for now.  He is still a kitten though, only weighs 6 pounds.  We might have to find a way to make it more durable when he gets bigger.",1
"This gate is much better than most on the market. The design allows it to function well as a gate, yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit. The gate is made of metal, but I deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic. Only time will tell how much real-world use it will stand up to. Another thing about this gate that I like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.",1
Didn't work . So disappointed. Looking for a remedy. 30# dog. Gave 1 for awhile and now giving 2. Still doesn't seem to be working.,0
"Very sturdy.  We got the purple, it is kind of purple/ gray. Nice...",1
"nice but i ordered one, got two.  no use in sending the other back",0
Great product!  Cleans great leaving my Yorkies coat clean and shiny!  smell's wonderful!,1
"This filter works great.  Very powerful for a 10 gallon tank.  Easy to change filters and the water turns the BIO-wheel.  You do have to prime the pump when starting up after a water change, not a big deal, but you do have to put in allot of water and I have had to pull up on the tube to get it started.",1
"I was so excited when I recived my ""paw glitz"" in the mail that I put it on my Jack russel immediately. As soon as I opened the bottle it smelled like regular nail polish and my dog started sneezing and running away. Feeling reluctant, I put it on her, she sneezed profusely and started shaking her paw as if it were hurting her. I then soaked her paw in water and got it off. Thankfully she returned to her joyful self, although I am still very disappointed with this product.",0
"I was worried my cat wouldn't take to a pet bed, because he's usually picky about everything, but he loved it. He sleeps in it all the time. I think the trick was to line it with a small blanket of his, but he will sleep in it even without his blanket. This is a great quality pet bed.",1
This item worked well for 2 days then stopped and has a short or something now it will sporadically work and then won't we have changed the battery still having trouble.  It is worth the money if it would continue to work.  It really did stop the neighbors dog from barking at us.  But the joy didn't last long.,0
Works great!!,1
birds love it,1
this coat is beautiful and fits my pom great. it is very well made. Thank You very much,1
As advertised.,1

"I expected the leafy part of this ""betta"" plant to be fabric, since plastic is commonly known to rip betta fins. Unfortunately for me, this thing turned out to be your common plastic aquarium plant on a suction cup...  and it's sharper then the average aquarium plant around the leaf tips & edges. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS PLANT FOR BETTA FISH... but it might be a decent plant for an aquarium containing less delicate fish.",0
"love arm and hammer products, cat loves the clumping  liter.",1
"Never really got my dog to like this toy - got it wet, froze it, but all he wanted to chew on was the blue ring. My dog (5 month old puppy) is a pretty aggressive chewer - he had pieces of the ring missing in days. Ended up having to throw it away.",0

"We bought this bed for our two lab mixes to share - 55 lbs and 45 lbs.  The larger of the two has a thing for being elevated when she sleeps.  She absolutely hated sleeping on the floor and would sneak onto our bed or couch as we slept (which is a big no-no in our household).

My husband said he did have a little difficulty putting it together, but it just took him a few minutes after figuring it out.  Other than that, this item has been great and has resolved our sneaky dog problem.  We simply laid their two fleece blankets on it (that they're used to sleeping on and have their scent) and they climb directly onto it whenever I open our bedroom door or tell them to go to bed.

Please keep in mind before ordering that the 'Large' size is VERY large.  I hadn't looked at the dimensions before ordering, but there is plenty of room for both of our dogs when they share it.  We probably could have also gone with the medium size and saved a little more space in our bedroom.

Great item, would purchase again!",1
Water started freezing in the bucket after using it 2 times!!!! NOT a good product and WAY too much money for just 2 uses!,0
Recalls on products.  Be careful.  Gave my dog dandruff.,0
This AI Hydra is fantastic...I purchased two from this seller for my 75 gallon tank along with the controller. The best led light out there for your reef tank...it doesn't have the swapability (it has the perfect combo of leds including UV so why would you have to?) of the Vega but it appears to have better lenses...beautiful shimmering light..control...growth...this light is the best! The seller is great he delivers faster then anyone else supplying the same thing. It comes nicely boxed and brand new. Highly recommend.,1

"OMG I publicly apologize to Red (my betta) for making you live in cold waters. I put this heater in my 1 gal Mini bow aquarium and within 30 minutes he was much perkier. He is the fish I bought this summer and grew to love. I live in Northern Calif. and keep my house cool and he was suffering. He now hangs out in front of the heater (on the side) just like my dachshunds in front of the gas fireplace, just chilling. Get it.",1

"This mat has been so useful in training our cats to stay away from certain rooms or furniture. My only problem is one of them seems to forget once and a while, so we have to break the mat out again and remind him.

After 1 year of use the mat has been useful, but it seems to have short circuited - no more zaps regardless of new batteries. Not acceptable for the price.",0

"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I gave this product the benefit of the doubt after having read some mixed reviews. Wish I hadn't, and would give 0 stars if possible.
My dog, who is not a heavy chewer, splintered it within 2 minutes. She swallowed some of the sharp fragments, and I am hoping that they pass safely.
She usually carries antlers around for months, so the fact that it didn't last 5 minutes outside the package speaks volumes. This product should be not be sold. UNSAFE.",0

Then, after a couple of weeks (to see if he could get used to it) the filter up and died. Did the next best thing. Turned the bottom of the insert into a ""betta platform"" and put the empty body horizontally in his tank. Now he appreciates it....as a somewhat expensive ""cave."" As for filtering we just went with the good ol' Lees triple flow corner filter. Oh, I gave this 2 stars instead of one only because Floyd is digging his new ""cave.""",0

"Dog Breed: Maltese/Yorkie 10 ibs
Used this dog kennel for one month; no issues. Material is not heavy duty but is sturdy for use with small dog. My dog isn't a chew-er nor is he aggressive.

Whether the kennel is sturdy or not may depend on the behavior and nature of your dog, if you've received kennel in good condition.",1

"I ordered this food for my cat because I ran out and I couldn't immediately run out to buy more because I was working and by the time I was off of work the stores would be closed so I used my prime shipping. The price for the amount of food is a great deal. When I received this my cat immediately wanted me to open the bag. I fed him his normal 1\3 cup amount and he ate it as he normally would. About 10 minutes later, I heard what sounded like my cat choking. When I went to see what was happening, he had vomited twice, a big puddle of this food. I have never had a problem with this brand of food when bought from the store. Every single time I have tried to feed my cat this food, he gets very sick and cannot keep any of it down. As a result this food is useless and I have wasted my money on food he can no longer eat. I have since bought the same food from Petco and it has not made him sick so this seems to be Amazon's problem. I will not be buying this again. Thank you for reading my review and and if it was helpful to you, let me know by hitting the yes button below my review. If it did not help you, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer any further questions you may have about the product.",0
"This is heavy material, but if your dog likes to destroy beds with zippers or velcro, this is not for you.  My dog promptly took care of this on the first day within a couple of hours. She turned the bed over, found the velcro going directly across the middle of the back of it and proceeded to work and rip until she ripped and tore the velcro completely off the bed and begun to pull out the bedding inside.  There is no repairing this.  I requested a refund instead of a replacement.  If they were so confident in the indestructible part, they would offer a full refund instead of only half your money back.  This was a complete waste of money for me. See attached pics for how this is put together on the back side and how easily a dog can pull apart this velcro and destroy it.  I would only recommend if you have a calm dog who is not an active chewer.",0
all 3 of my cats loved this little mid size bed (perfect for Chihuahua type dogs),1
"We have used the ecollar et-300 for the past year on our rescued hound-mix. Prior to our adopting our hound Red, he had been homed twice but returned because he was too distractable and ""untrainable"". We knew he would be a challenge so we sought out help from a trainer OLK9 in Blacksburg, VA. They use the e-collar in their training system. Now, with the use of the ecollar (only set on vibrate 99% of the time) we have a well-behaved hound who is a blast to take on the trails off leash. Red still gets distracted occasionally but we can gently get his attention back with the remote. I HIGHLY recommend the e-collar along with either a trainer or owner education (ecollar has video training).",1
My dog loves the smell and taste of the pill wrap. I put a tiny bit on a pill and he eats it with no problem. One 4 oz container lasted me about two months.,1
I have used this product for the past 4-5 years and my ultra picky Persian kitties love it. I would recommend it if your vet thinks it is a good idea. By the way here is much cheaper than the vet's office.,1
My rats favorite food,1
I have ordered these for over a year now from Amazon and this is the first time this has happened. I reached into the bag to pull a greenie out and a JUMBO Greenie had somehow made its way into this package of TEENIE greenies.,0

"My cat loves to look in at the turtles but after he fell in the water for the second time in less than a year, I decided I had to get a cover.  This cover works great.  Now the cat can lay on top of it and peer into the tank all he wants.",1
"My family recently adopted a 2 year old Boxer rescue.  Now, I don't know if this was the way he was raised, or due to his time on the streets, but this guy would inhale his food in about 15 seconds (seriously...I timed it once).  With him eating that fast, we were worried about gas, bloat, or other digestive issues that can arise in a speed eater, so I looked for a solution.

This feeder seemed the best fit for me.  It boasted a wide flat base, so little chance of the dog tipping it over to get at the food, it is dishwasher safe, and the ""blades"" are smooth and rounded and made of durable plastic, so even if you have a chewer they should be okay.

When we used this the first time, my 15-second eater took about 20 minutes to finish his meal.  We've had it for a few months now, so he has pretty much mastered the thing, and his average eat time now is about 6 - 7 minutes.  That's for 1 1/2 cups (twice a day).  The product definitely works as advertised, and I haven't had any issues at all, or seen any downsides to it.

Update:

After almost a year of use I must, sadly, reduce my rating on this.  While it seemed great at first, I've noticed that it has started wearing blisters and sores into my Boxer's muzzle.  This started happening almost as soon as we got it, but I attributed the sores to previous injuries (he was a rescue that had been pretty banged up).  The blistering didn't happen every time either, which made it seem more likely to be not related to the feeder.  After all this time though, I've been able to ascertain that the feeder is responsible for causing the sores and blisters, some of which bleed freely.

Because of this, I can no longer recommend this feeder.  It seemed great at first, and it really does slow down a fast eater, but the health risks are just too great.

I'm hoping the company comes out with an updated model, maybe with shorter blades that are spaced farther apart (and less in number).  Enough to slow the dog down, without him/her having to constantly rub his/her muzzle on them while eating.  I'd definitely be willing to try an updated model that addressed these issues.

Pros:
- Safely slows down eating
- Doesn't tip over
- Entertains the dog, similar to treat-puzzles
- Entertains the owner
- Great conversation piece (""Whatdya mean that's the dog's bowl?"")
- Easy to clean
- Easy to pour food into

Cons
- Larger than a regular bowl (I'd say maybe about the size of two bowls side-by-side).  Hasn't been an issue for us, and we have a small house
- Stepping on the thing at 2am when you creep downstairs for a glass of milk isn't fun.  May want to make sure it's out of the way before bedtime.
- Can cause open (bleeding) sores and blisters around the dog's mouth and chin.  This is a deal-breaker in my opinion.",0
This is perfect for our dog.  He is fairly laid back but did not mind this one bit.  And it is HANDS DOWN better than those clear plastic cones.  Our Lab is quite stocky so he did need the XL.  Wish we had found these for our others before surgery!,1
Easy to assemble and clean up on case there is an accident. Nice way to have your pet out if they are not able to run around when we went camping. Like it so much I bought two,1
Only one cat of 4 would eat these,0
The large was not big enough but the x-large fits very well!,1
"Not really for long-haired, double coated dogs. Im sure it works fine for other coats.",1
"The concept for this product is sound and in fact is great - however, the implementation needs much to be desired.  This divider is easy enough to put together, slide the mesh into the two long side bars.  Unfortunately, it comes out just as easily letting the fish you are trying to separate co-mingle again.  I put this thing together 3 times and re-inserted it into the tank and finally gave up.  Instead of sliding it into place on the side bars, the side bars need teeth and need to fold over to clamp onto the mesh so that it cannot slide out of place.  Or some other solution needs to be developed, but this is not working for my tank. I feel like super-gluing the mesh into place but I don't know what that would do to the fish or if it would hold under prolonged underwater exposure.  I am so frustrated and disappointed.",0
My grand dog  chews these and loves to play with them! Great price!,1
"This was a waste of my money. I tried to give it no stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me. I was hoping that the strings on this rope would be more durable than the cotton ropes I've bought in the past because slowly over a year or so my dog will pluck the strings out until the rope breaks or gets really ratty looking. The strings in this rope are really shiny and slippery. Within seconds of handing it to the dog one of the end knots had come untied. If you have a pup that likes to play with a rope at all, this thing will come untied very quickly. I've retied it. It's not worth paying the return shipping. We'll see how long before it comes undone again...",0
"I just received this item today. Glad I purchased well in advance of my trip as I have to return this as unsafe and unusable.
As soon as I got it out of the box I noticed the wiring on one side looked warped.
From the start there was a problem- the directions say to first lift top panel like a page from a book, then  to lift up on the crate. The page part opened, but it wouldn't lift up. I looked all over it and realized it had been stuck together with one of the connectors, so I had to get that unstuck before proceeding, which wasn't easy.
I set it up according to directions (make sure one side is out, one is in... other odd instructions...).
As I was putting it together, I noticed that the connecting bits all had cut wire. But I assembled anyway to see if maybe it was part of the design. After assembling, the crate was sturdy enough, but did not look like something that could withhold an anxious dog. More importantly, those cut wires were clearly a hazard. Some actually stick out enough to cut. There is no way I would leave my dog alone in this crate with those cut wires.
I have included photos to show what I mean. Every connector (not sure what else to call them) on the crate has the cut wire. I showed it to our dog walker who came over right after I assembled the crate, and his immediate reaction  was ""wow- that's dangerous!"" He said it looked like it was supposed to be soldered but wasn't.
Obviously I am not keeping this item. I will look elsewhere for a crate that does not pose an obvious risk of harm to my dog or myself.",0
"All of my fish absolutely love this stuff.  It sinks quickly, so the bottom feeders can eat it.",1

"I have a 6 year old German Rottie, everytime I placed this muzzle on him and he would get his bottom jaw out every time, he would sit quietly and let me place it on him securely and then he would just start playing around and slip his bottom jaw out every time, I  couldn't be mad at my Samson, he was letting me know the muzzle was worthless, so I gave it to him as a chew toy.  For short snouts it doesn't work.",0

"This stuff works well and is MUCH less expensive than other urine destroyers on the market.

I agree with other reviewers that it leaves a relatively strong perfume smell if used liberally on carpet. Conversely, it does NOT leave a strong perfume smell if you use it on hard surfaces briefly. Even on carpets, the perfume smell is gone within a day.

It eliminated about 70% of the urine smell from a heavily soiled area. Let's put it this way, it removed it enough that my landlord didn't charge me for carpet cleaning after I moved out.",1
"I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4"" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".

What difference does it make?

Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4"" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!

Will not order again from this supplier.",0
"I was skeptical but am now a believer!  I'm very very happy with this product.  My cat, Sadie,  was spraying in two corners of my living room no matter how pristine I kept her litter box.  After having my carpet cleaned too many times to count, I heard about this product from a friend.  I first filled the litter box with a 50/50 mix and Sadie stopped peeing on the carpet immediately, preferring her litter box.  I continued to keep the areas of the carpet covered with a towel for about a month since it seemed to good to be true.  I've now removed the towels for 2 weeks and have found no signs of cat urine.  This product really did the trick.  I did take the advice of one user and keep the bag in a small utility closet so the cat cannot get near it since the attractant is very strong.",1

My dog has what the vet described as a torn ACL when he takes this he is not in pain and can walk normal.  This product saved me $1500.00 that is what a operation would have cost.,1
These were sent in a soft package- I ordered 3 total. It says they are supposed to last 80 hours. When I received mine in the mail they were already flashing. I gave the 2 others away to friends and I am not sure how long they lasted but I took my dog camping last weekend- clipped it on and was sad to see that it didn't work anymore. I loved the idea but they really need a tab to keep the battery from engaging BEFORE they mail them or basically your out of luck...... :(,0

Collar was very pretty an looked great but half the stones have already fallen out an my dogs only wore it for  week. Definitely will not buy this brand of collar again..

"The Dog Silencer Pro Ultimate Pack is a phenomenal product! We have 4 Miniature Schnauzers that can get quite vocal. We just moved into a brand new home in a new subdivision. The dogs were barking at every little noise in their new surroundings. We are on a golf course so there are golfers and joggers and walkers everywhere, and the dogs would bark at all of them. We didn't want to get bark collars or spray collars, so I did some research and it looked like the Dog Silencer Pro was a humane way to stop our dogs from barking. Believe me, we have tried every type of training method. My husband put the unit in the back yard, where the dogs were barking the most, and now they are quiet! They are even quiet when we come home! I couldn't be happier with this product. It also comes with a remote key fob that activates the unit if the dogs get noisy.",1

"My use of this product for my male Doxie will take several months to really see if it does the trick for my little guy. This product was 3x's less than what I paid at the Vets! Hurray.  I am told it has a chicken flavor, but my fussy eater can only tolerate 1/2 a packet over his food. I've also tried to shake it over a scrambled egg to encourage his eating of it. After one month I believe it has helped.  Several Vets have told me it can take 2-3 months to see the results of food and probiotics for your dog.  (I believe this also comes in a formula for cats.)",1
This was too big for my dog,0
When preparing for a show this is vital !!,1
"My two dogs have been eating this for 3 weeks now and are doing great on it. I saw zero digestive distress as I switched to this from another food.

The protein sources are impressive, and the fact that it's grain-free make it great for my overweight dog with allergy problems. She had itching problems prior to this food, but following a vet's advice I went grain-free and this problem has cleared up. She's also lost some weight, so all is going well.",1
"We got 2 of these crates; one for our grown French Bulldog, and one for our Bloodhound puppy. Our Frenchie is doing well in his. Our big issue was with the larger crate for our bloodhound. It says it's for dogs up to 100 lbs, which is impossible. He is currently around 65 lbs and still growing. He is so cramped in there!!!  The proper size crate for a 100 lb dog is 48x30, and this is no where near that!  I can't even image how cramped he'd be in there at 100 lbs!  Also, the ""espresso""  color, is black, and the top looks like black and gray wood grain. There is absolutely NO espresso color to be found on this crate. They're made of plastic.  Our Bloodhound has begun to chew a hole in it at the bottom of the bars. The screws holding the latch are constantly loosening, which means we're constantly tightening. Yes, they look WAY better than a wire kennel, but now having to order another larger kennel that really can hold a 100 lb dog, has proven this crate to be a $200 mistake!!  If you have a smaller dog, it might be sufficient, but NOT for larger dogs. Buy a wire kennel and a cover like we just did.  This $200 box will be hitting the curb with the other trash.",0

I purchased this product after reading all the good reviews but I was very dissatisfied with this product.

Will not purchase this item again.,0

My baby chinchilla has turned this bowl over every other day since I've installed it. I've had to put less and less food in it each time so I'm not wasting a whole bowl in the droppings tray. He's obviously not too big for it because he's a baby it just unhooked from the holder super easily. I've even moved it all the way to the bottom of the cage so there isn't a gap between the floor and the bowl and he still flips it very easily.,0

"Didn't seem to work at all, although keeping up with three times per day for 14 days was not easy and I couldn't keep up, especially since it recommended putting it in the water but my cats only drink a tiny bit at a time. All three of my animals vomited and had diarrhea with this stuff. It just didn't seem worth it and I ended up getting a prescription for revolution to take care of any worms I suspected since we have a new kitten. I wouldn't buy this again and regret buying it.",0
Horrible product.,0
"within 10 mins.  the dog bit hard and the plug came out and the light/battery assembly fell into the snow,  and not to be found until the snow melts.  I don't put the light/battery assembly into the ball again because the dog will probably swallow it. now it has no light",0

"This is the best product I have found for conveniently carrying our two Chihuahuas everywhere. It has a tether in side to secure your pup by their harness so if they decide to jump out they cannot...which I love because you know Chihuahuas have little attitudes that can get them in trouble with bigger dogs. This makes me feel like their safe when we're out and about or simply walking with our chocolate lab in our neighborhood. I may add that Chihuahuas LOVE it!! Our two will get inside it themselves when we say ""let's go"". They are still and ready to be buckled in and taken to the next adventure. It also has storage for treats or a leaches. I can even for my iPhone 7plus in the little pocket on the strap.  U can see in the pictures I provided that they are so clam that they just fall asleep. I actually took both of them to the vet strapped on to my body together. They are not over 3 pounds each so it wasn't a heavy load. I did purchase the smallest size because I am not quite five feet and my daughter is even more petite. So the taller u are I would order the bigger size to accommodate you because (the smallest size) would be too short on your body for a taller person. Even it u have a small dog I would order a bigger size to accommodate your height. I love that it's made for the shorter people though!! The pouch is made well, wipes off easily and is comfortable!! I can't say enough about it. The only thing I want to make sure I stress is that it is made for shorter humans. There is not much adjustability in the length of the strap. The picture u see below on my daughter, keep in mind she is 4'10"" and this is the smallest size they come in.  Hope my review helps!!",1

"Having a pit puppy that is already 60 pounds, I didn't know what size to get since we don't really know how big she is going to get. She was already out growing a medium size kennel, so we needed an upgrade. Going to Petco and getting an XXL kennel for her would of broke our bank. For the price I love it. My pit has enough room to chase her tail, lay down in every way she can think of, and she loves it.",1
I have bought two of these over the past years. Both worked great at the start but the on/off switch circuit board gets corroded and fails. This is due to the battery compartment not being 100% sealed and water getting in. It is a bad design fault. Do not submerge above the battery cap. This unit should have been recalled by eheim and money refunded.,0
"Buy at your own risk!!!! It worked fine for a week until today when he bit a piece of it off and ingested a CHUNK of one of the mounds. It's made of thick silicone, but was surprised my kitten was able to tear it off.",0
Lasted a day,0
Black lab year a half old. Destroyed this toy in two days of getting it. I expected the product to last longer and I am disappointed with the lack of quality. Do not recommend and will not purchase again.,0
What can I say except they are pet food covers. Although they could be used on a can of regular tuna etc. as well since there are no animal features on the caps. They seem solid. Only time will tell how long they'll last.,1
My dog likes them and they are very reasonable but best they are an excellent brand and good for her.,1
Got moldy too fast,0
"if your dog is SMALL this might be ok, I am talking about tiny dogs. Mine is 35 lbs, she is a little bull terrier, and it is very tight going over her head and I got a med, to fit her neck as told to do so.. so disappointed.",0
"This is a hefty leash,  Wrap your hand around this and you have a good grip. It is not likely to slip and burn your skin.  Great quality clip. This is more than I need for my 55 pound dog but I like the feel. I would not like to walk the dog this leash could not handle. Have not tried the whistle.  It seems an odd inclusion.",1
"chewed the top right off of this in a matter of 30 minutes. On the up side, once he got the top off he left the rest intact, but now it's pretty easy for him to get to the contents I put inside. I actually wish I would never have bought the Kong because now he won't touch a Nylabone. At least a Nylabone would last him 3 or 4 days. Also, he put on weight because of the kong. This toy sounds like it works for other dogs, but it doesn't work for mine. Might be worth a try for most folks.",0
"I bought 2 of these beds, and my dogs absolutely love them. Unlike other beds with bolsters around them, this one is fairly easy to get apart to wash.",1
My pug loves these. They don't last long and she always leaves a nub for later.  I buy the biggest size so she can knaw on it for longer.,1
All went great. 5 star service,1
"While the size is appropriate for large parrots, it is not meant for aggressive chewers.  Our Blue & Gold Macaw demolished this toy in one day.",0
My three dogs did not like this food. I am trying to find one they like. I won't be ordering this again.,0
"Squaker toys don't last very long at our house.  This one is still going strong.  The toy has multiple squeekers and perhaps our dog realizes that she cannot effect a ""toy kill"" without a lot of work.
Highly recommented for it's cuteness and longevity.",1
"If, by some miracle, your cats (I have two small Siamese) only use their litter boy on days beginning with an 'S,' then this product may suit your needs. I, however, have two cats who regularly use their box with great gusto as they are like most cats and find nothing more inviting than a clean litter box. While it IS very easy to remove from the box and assemble, the ease of use and sanitary benefits reported by the manufacturer end there.

The handy sensor eye likes to come on when the cat moves, rather than when it vacates the box. This is hilarious if you like watching cats have panic attacks but not so great given the cat may not be done with their 'business' yet. On the plus side, the resulting mess cleans off of the plastic housing very easily with spray cleaner and a towel.

The raking mechanism gets jammed frequently with Mister Fluffykins' treasured leavings even with the most expensive hard clumping litter (that made by the manufacturer, available separately and rather expensive). In addition, the rake's tines do NOT penetrate to the bottom of the box, resulting in a very firm layer of debris to scoop manually and dispose of every day or so. Lots of dry litter made its way into the (rather flimsy) waste receptacle, meaning I ended up adding more almost daily.

The motor strains when the thing runs, giving it the same sound as an arthritic goat trying to jump over a mountain of cat manure.

I find myself doing more scooping and cleaning with the Self-Cleaning Multicat LitterMaid box that I do with say a normal sifting litter box (available for fifteen dollars at the same supplier which sent this cumbersome, noisy, expensive contraption. I do not recommend this product for ease of cleaning, sanitation, and less bother than a traditional litter set-up. It doesn't really live up to its hype, even with two more pans beside it. My cats prefer their normal boxes, and use this infrequently at best (which it still has trouble keeping up with).",0
Will not stick to our food bowl... Dog slides it around or noses it out of the bowl every time. Waste of my money,0
I like that it matches the harness. It is great for night time walks. It looks to be very well made.,1
Our crazy (previously barn cat) LOVES this toy!  It is hilarious because she stalks it and then pounces. This toy never gets old.,1
It looks good here ...it won't stay on with your kitties. 1..2..3.... and its gone .  we have tried over and over .,0
"Would give this zero stars if I could. Didn't know when I bought it that I wanted to buy one that said ""silent"" whistle in the description. So that part is my fault and is not why I'm giving it a low rating. Given that this is not meant to be a silent whistle (meaning it's not meant to be the kind that pets hear but humans don't), I would expect it to make a healthy whistle. It doesn't; it makes a pathetic, wimpy little sound no matter how it's adjusted. So our pets don't even look up. Totally disappointing. Wish we hadn't bought it. That's why the low rating. Guess the one thing it might be good for is a fairly-large key ring!

UPDATE 5/14/13: It now says ""silent"" in the description. Hmmm. Wonder if they changed the product or just the ad. The one we bought was neither silent, nor did it make a true whistle sound.",0
The snails seem to like the smaller ones better,1
Snapped the first day,0
"Worked fairly well as far as keeping my dog from pulling.  But, left cuts under her armpits.  Unfortunately I realized this too late to return it.",0
"2/ 3 months without complaints. Works great for a large black lab. Only used the taser feature once when said lab tried to introduce himself to a well fed black bear. Vibrate and sound gives excellent response. Unit is water right and easy to charge both at the same time.
Save yourself from waisting money on cheapos like I did!!",1
"For those worried about ""full-figured"" cats getting in and out alright, my cat is nearly 20 pounds and uses it just fine. It doesn't look roomy, but he doesn't hesitate. The good news is, he's no longer able to kick litter out the opening which is wonderful, but tracking (Tidy Cats Litter) still happens some. He doesn't have to land on the top before getting to the floor. He can leap from the litter to the floor if he's feeling sporty, so he still has some crumbs stuck to his paws. (If anyone has a suggestion for a litter that tracks less and is low dust, I'd love to hear it. I can't stand the silica ones, and the pine pellets don't control odor.)
It looks better than other boxes, but I don't think anyone would be completely shocked to hear it is a litter box if they were close to it. The liners are very good and my cat doesn't scratch through them like disposables. It fits a little less closely over time because lifting it in and out with heavy litter warps the metal band a bit, but not a huge deal. You can order more liners through their site when needed. I think the price is steep, but until there is a competitor making something comparable for less...Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",1
"Didn't do anything to shut up neighbor's dog. They've gotten much better at controlling his yappings, though.",0
faster and good quality,1
great,1
It is rigid and puppy was completely disinterest,0
"The idea is pretty cool, the squeeker was pretty good but within minutes my 8 month old puppy ate the edges off in chunks.  Not recommended.",0
"Excellent for providing small amounts of water for doggo in the crate while I'm at work. Bowl is slightly stiff/can slosh at bit to get out and slide back in, hence only four stars; this however prevents Fido from dumping it and coming home to soggy puppy.",1
"My 15-year-old Weimaraner loves this particular brand and she is lost without one in her mouth when shes walking around the house.
These are a great alternative to rawhide for dogs with allergies or sensitive stomachs.  Although they can be a tad greasy at first and dark in color, they will not stain or discolor carpets which is a huge plus. The smell is not as bad as with some other brands, but it does smell when being chewed.

I always buy these from my local pet store, but theyve been out of stock for several weeks. Even their warehouse is backordered on this item! So I decided to try finding one online. The reason for the deducted star is the $6.98 pricetag. My local pet store sells these for $3.99 a piece and often has them on sale for $3.19 so I can get two for this price.",1
I use this to feed my pup soft treats mixed with wet food that I freeze over night.  It's like a puppy popsicle that helps to distract him when I leave.  It's also been valuable to keep him eating when he was sick.,1
"i bought 8 of these for my tanks. waste of money. they worked fine int he summer when my house was warm. now that it is winter and my house gets down to 68 degrees at night, they are only heating to 74, 76 sometimes even 72!! i'm going to have to buy new heaters for all tanks.",0
I like it,1
"Great toys, last much longer than any other toys.",1
This feeder has an inherent design flaw that does not permit room for birds to perch to feed. It is probably designed for construction utility and cost savings. Most feeders provide rood for perching birds by having a wider base or recessed slanted plastic plates to provide more room. It is not designed for birds. I have fed birds for 50 years with 20+ species in my yard and this is the worst feeder I have ever had. Birds will not use it. Woodstream should know better and improve the construction design.,0
Smaller than expected,0
"It's overpriced, my 2 cats had gone through it in 5-7 days and it did not cover much smell at all. Was not impressed.",0
too big & bulky...my dogs hate em,0
Terrible litter. Breaks apart into tiny clumps very easily. I will not purchase this litter again.,0
The sisal starting pulling away from the base after a week of use. Not worth the $$.,0
"It definitely works when my husband and I walk passed it. It works when my cat walks passed it. However, it also goes off on its own. Finally, it will go off if you walk behind it, even if you're more than 10 feet away. 50% of the random sprays continue to spray every second until you turn it off and back on. Not only has it deterred my cat from unwanted spots, but it has confused her into thinking half of the house is off limits because it is often spraying air at random times. She has 2 litter boxes, but her favorite to use she uses a lot less. I'm guessing this is because the can may have gone off while she was near or inside of it, even though the can is facing the opposite direction and over 12 feet away. I really want this product to work, but so far it has quite some kinks that prevent it from being the amazing product that it is meant to be. I've purchased several and have had the same results with all. If someone decided to purchase this product, I really hope they have better results.",0
So far so good! Tear stains minimized dramatically within two weeks.,1
My RES hates this food. Not sure why. It also seemed to dirty the tank faster. Even when I swore I netted all the unbeaten pieces out. Dirty water could have been bc he just didn't like the food so more ended up in his rocks.,0
my neighbors have a tibetan spaniel who comes over to see me almost every day.  he thinks he deserves a treat just for being adorable.  he wouldn't even consider these when i offered them to him.  tried setting them in a pan and he still wasn't interested.  guess i'll have to keep them in my truck and toss them to stray cats i see around town.,0
"PetSafe's Easy Walk harness is a great device for cutting down on a dog's obnoxious and endless pulling.  I've been using one on my Wheaton Terrier for years, and this new ""bling"" version works exactly the same but now it's sparkly!

The Easy Walk harness is very nicely made.  The nylon used is high density and quality and all of the clasps, metal loops, and adjustment sliders are sturdy and robust.  This is a high quality piece that should last for years.  Indeed, my other Easy Walk harness was purchased in 2012 and is still going strong.

The Easy Walk is very easy to use.  To place it on your dog you will put the section that the leash attaches to below the dog's head on the front of its chest.  The two remaining straps go behind the front legs, one under the chest and the other above it.  The three straps are adjustable, and the two that go around the chest have clips to easily remove them, making the harness simple to take on and off your dog.  It takes a few minutes to get a proper fit.

Since the dog's leash now connects below the dog's head the Easy Walk reduces pulling by forcing your dog to turn their head in the direction that you are pulling on the leash.  It's an ingenious system that doesn't hurt the dog, and really does reduce pulling a lot.  I use the Easy Walk on my 7 year old Wheaton Terrier.  She is about 25 pounds and loves to pull, pull, pull when going on walks.  Even just to sniff a part of the grass she will pull you, and forget it if she sees a squirrel, it's like tug-of-war.  The Easy Walk harness reduces the pulling significantly compared to a traditional collar and makes taking her for walks so much more peaceful.  Mind you, it does not completely eliminate pulling, she still pulls a bit when she sees another animal, but it is much, much easier to control.  With proper training and the Easy Walk I bet my Wheaton would be the best behaved dog around... but about that training.

Lest you think the Easy Walk is all function, this ""bling"" version is also very fun.  The front and top part of the harness are covered in sparkly fabric similar to the loop end of Velcro.  It's very bright and really catches the light.  I love it!

All in all... a great harness.",1
"I have one cat who particularly hated her previous lounge scratcher with such a passion that she showed contempt towards it and sprayed on it.  When I got this in, she claimed it as her personal scratcher/ lounger and all the other kitties beware!  Being double sided the cost is well worth the $7-$11 and I will absolutely be re-ordering when a new one is needed.  Not to mention that it came in a nice sized box that the kitties enjoyed playing in too.",1
Very cute!!,1
"Great quality, worth the money. I have another stand from this brand it's also great!",1
It has a terrible smell I can't wash out.,0
it came very quickly and seems to work fine.,1
"My dogs love the food. Good value for no grain dog food. Also, I feel this product helps to maintain a healthy weight for my dogs.",1
I got this for my puppy and he loves it !! .. will buy again next time. I would recommend this to any puppy when they are teething.,1
"So far this product is egh. I'm comparing it to the Aquatic Life LED Aquarium Light Fixture.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H3Y4YF8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

While some of the features seem cool for the most part I find them useless. This is after 3 days of having this product. I'm actually thinking about returning it.  I Hate that you can't set the actual time or that you can't program the light to go off at a certain time.  I don't need some sort of light 24/7.  I know it says 24/7 but that feature I've found out is pretty dumb. My tank doesn't really need light from 12am -6am  Noone is awake to see the light.  If I want it off I have to turn it off them back on again in the morning.  Defeats the purpose of having some sort of timer on it.  Changing the intensity is ok, but the program buttons are for only one color.

The Aquatic Life LED had a actual clock on the light and display ( The Finnex does not, the only way to control the light is by remote) I can set the time the lights go on and off  and the duration of each light mode(3)  I was almost immediately disappointed with this product as soon as I plugged it in and used it.  One of the fastest disappointed products that I've bought.",0
"I started using the Citykitty with my 6 month old rescue kitten.  She did very well for the 1st  few weeks.  No accidents until the final 2 rings were left.  I would remove a full ring every 3-4 days and it was amazing, but then.... I found she did fine with her urine in the toilet, but did no. 2 on the floor. Her first accident.  I decided to return to the beginning(replacement ring) for a few days and all was well. No problem.  Then I removed 2 rings of the replacement, going back to just before her 1st accident.  She would pee in the toilet and do her business on the floor. I had her watch me clean it up and I piled the kitty litter in the rings.  She is rather regular and does her business about midnight every night so I waited until I knew it was about time and just camped out in the bathroom with her. She peed just fine, and I knew she wanted to do her business and she started to go to the same spot on the floor and I just picked her up then put even more kitty litter on the rings, she got it and did her business on the rings.  I am so proud of her.  Now she knows what I want.  I will slow down on the removal of the final rings as I read others have done and only remove a 1/2 a ring at a time. I am so looking forward to no bathroom messes, kitty litter or otherwise.
I forgot to say, cleaning the citykitty tray is a bit easier now that I use the emptycardboard toilet paper rolls.  They work quite well in scraping the kitty litter from the rings and I just toss them in the garbage afterwards.",1
"Never thought I needed a launcher, but it's actually been a great buy.  Our pup is tireless, but my shoulder's not.  I can throw far for an hour & don't need advil when I get home!  Don't need to worry about picking up muddy or slobbered on tennis balls either.  Remember length doesn't just help you throw further; you won't need to bend as much to pick up the ball.",1
Love this bag! Get compliments on it all the time and asked where I got it. Great for taking my Chihuahua out on errands. She can see what's going on and just hangs out.,1
"I hate to give it a low review, because my dog loves it, it can hold a great deal of food, and it helps control his feeding. While they do state that it's not a chew toy, my dog put holes in it on the first use and with me watching. I tried to salvage it and let him use it for short periods of time, but after a short time, I realized the toy was about to get dangerous. When a friend helped me with a favor to feed my dog while I was gone, of course he didn't know not to use it, and my dog ate almost the entire top half of the toy. Luckily he was fine.

Bottom line is it just didn't last long. For reference I have a 75lb ridgeback mix.",0
Actually my dog loves them!  And my vet recommends them.,1
"It was my dog's 12th birthday, easy to say, he loved the cake.",1
I purchased this crate specifically because it was top opening. The top does not open. The wires that hold it closed are too long and will not allow it to be retracted enough to open at all. It came with the top door already installed so I am unable to cut the wire off. Very disappointed with it.,0
"this states ""mini"" but it is far too big for my 8 and 10 lb dogs.",0
The picture makes it look like a substantial black light flashlight. it's not. It's a little toy. Any black light will show fluids in the dark.,0
When this product arrived it was missing the blue measuring cap.  I do not need to return the bottle of conditioner as it had a foil seal on the top of the bottle.  I simply need the blue measuring cap.,0
"It doesnt hold mice , they have all escaped. So now my house is filled with mice !! So annoying",0
"easily destructible, save your money",0
"I paid $60.00 for a bottle of concentrate of this stuff and I just may as well have set a match to the money. My dog had an accident on the basement floor (urine) so I scrubbed it with my usual floor cleaner. The urine smell did not come out so then I used a bleach combination, still odor. After several attempts with various concoctions failed to get the odor out I decided to try this stuff. I followed the directions and as soon as it dried, still urine odor. I tried again using more of the product; still odor. I have even tried dumping this stuff directly on the spot, and it still didn't work. I ended up going to my local animal shelter and asked them if they could suggest anything that would get the odor out, and they were kind enough to give me some of the product they use at the shelter, and voila! Odor gone after the first use. I asked them about the odorxit and they told me they had sent them some to try at the shelter, but it didn't even work in the viewing area where they only view dogs, but do not house them there. So, if you are looking for an expensive air freshener this might work, but if you are thinking about using it to remove urine odors from something like a basement floor that is pourous, forget it and save your money. One reviewer said it worked on a berber carpet and they had saturated the carpet with this. My guess is that the carpet never actually dried, and my bet is if they ever pull it up the odor will still be in the subfloor.",0
Perfect size and cats love it!,1
Horrible. My dogs literally just sat on it and looked at me. Did nothing to deter them.,0

You can smell the natural ingredients when you open the bag. Great product! It is a part of our daily regimen.,1
"I was skeptical to buy this brush as it was not the name brand deshedding tool. I worked as a dog groomer for awhile and swore by the furminator brand, so much so I always told my customers to only buy the name brand.

"Took our corgi for a kayak ride. She had not previously been in the water or on a boat. The device went on quickly, had velcro fasteners and adjustable straps. I liked that there was a double float strap under her chin. I practiced lifting her up and down on land and she was not scared or experiencing a loss of balance with the handles on the top of the vest. She was able to move within the vest and did not feel constrained. It came off really quickly, too. There was no sense of urgency to get it off! as there is with some harnesses or leashes. It's a nice product, a low price. Many of the folks at the lake that day & our fellow kayakers were interested!",1
"Carrier is great- love the expansion especially when traveling.  However, the mesh is weak. Our cat (8 months old) ripped right thru it before the plane took off.",1
"This collar worked out wonderfully for my dog after she had her surgery.  I did secure it by fitting her collar into the loops.  (She was able to take it off if I did not do this)

I would highly recommend purchasing this collar weeks before any surgeries and putting it on your dog so they can get used to it (they will not like it, at first) and to make sure they can't pull it off.

After a day or so of wearing it, she was perfectly fine wearing it.  And she looked so comfortable when she was sleeping.

Just make sure you fit the collar to where it's tight enough that the dog can't pull it off, but not too tight to where it's hurting them.",1
"This is my second order of these potty pads. Since I've been using them, there have been a lot less accidents on the floor, and there have been no seeping through the pads.  I will be ordering these pads again.",1

"I was hesitant to buy this based on some of the reviews.  However for the price thought we'd give it a try.  This cage is great.  The lab puppy loves it, roomy, easy to assemble, and sturdy.

"I've had this for over two years and my cat loves it. He perches on top of it and he scratches it whenever he feels like it. (He scratches a little cardboard thing I got from target more, but I thought having something long-term and stable would be nice). He also loves when anyone puts  his toys near the top or on the top of the post because he jumps up and clings to the post like King Kong on the Empire State Building. It has never once fallen over and my cat is really active and weighs 14 lb. One time he jumped and clung to it with more speed than usual and it sort of rocked, but my cat was still hanging off the side and he still jumps on it that way to this day.",1
Our dogs love these sticks.  We have medium sized dogs and these sticks last them for a long time.  Our dogs become very well behaved when we bring these treats out of the cabinet.  Will definitely buy again!,1
This trimmer would not turn on so I  but it still would not start.  Then in the middle of the night the trimmer started running and I had to get out of bed to turn it off.  The next morning I turned it on again but it would not start after several attempts so I returned it.,0
This product works on contact.  It definitely kills the fleas in the tub when you are washing your animals.  It doesn't prevent fleas afterwards so don't expect that.  You need to frontline or similar products for that.,1
Puppy was able to rip open the front and back of this toy within the first 2 hours of getting it. She loved the toy is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. The fact she was able to rip it open in 2 hours I would give it Zero stars!,0

"Fit was accurate for my dog, who is hard to fit. She is a dachshund mix with a wide chest and small neck. The quality of this harness is great; sturdy and well made. I love the handle; I can quickly get the dog out of harm's way if need be, or give her a lift over large obstacles while hiking. I also like dunking the harness in water on hot days to keep her cool. This is a is a great product for my small dog who doesn't pull much, but because the front strap goes more across the chest than the neck, I it does not prevent pulling at all, which is good or bad depending on your pup.",1

The pet feeder doesn't work properly.  It will dispense the amount of food required if you tap on the top of the feeder after the initial amount comes out.  This defeats the purpose of the appliance.,0
Size is not accurate.  Waste of my money,0
"By the time my betta got accustomed to it, the paint was peeling and I found myself having to do water changes so much more frequently than I had to because of the unsightly chips of paint floating around.",0
Does not work. Don't waste your money,0
Definitely use these after your dog eats.  Keeps their teeth clean!  With consistent use my 7 yr old dog has only had to have her teeth cleaned once-and the vet complimented how relatively clean her teeth were when I don't even brush her teeth.,1
Our dog loved this toy and played about 30 minutes until he tore ear off and started choking on it ... the broad part was good but the rest tore right off ..,0
"They arrived alive and healthy, It was a little strange that they were just crawling around in the box with some cut up paper rather than a cup, but hey, what can you do,  other than that I am very pleased, I even found a molted exoskeleton in the box which made me happy.",1
"I was very impressed with the price for all the features, but on a long walk the collar went to sleep and became useless. My dog chased a groundhog and the collar didn't wake up till about the third tackle. Tried it again on another walk when my dog started to run after a fawn that jumped up in front of him. The collar didn't wake up even after my dog jumped over a log. Sleep function on the remote is ok ,but not on the collar. I guess you get what you pay for.",0
Broken and defective when we went to give it to the cats. Mouse spins in circles and does not go straight.,0

"I had my doubs about it when I bought it, because  I have found more often then not the Nitrifying Bacteria sold for cycling is usually dead by the time you get it. I took shot because the risk of losing a few dollars was worh the gamble in my case, but Isuspect all you are doing is  pouring dead bacterian into a tank that does nothing.  Doesn't hurt anything, but doesn't help either. The reason it gave it two stars instead of one is the cost is cheap enough and who knows someone might get lucky and get a fresh bottle where the bacteria isn't dead.",0

Not worth the money at all.  Spending this much on a collar for just Bark Control is really not worth it.  An electronic training collar is a much better investment.,0
It worked perfectly.,1

Wonderful products. My dogs love TOTW dry dog food.,1
"I've used these ceramic blades for years for grooming. I find that they last longer (so long as you don't drop them), and stay cooler than steel blades. They're compatible with my Wahl KM2 A5 type clippers. Will continue using the ceramic edge for a long time to come.",1
The smell is overbearing and I don't even mind strong smells..,0
"I have 2 indoor cats and so far, I haven't had a problem with this item. I was first introduced to frontline because thats what my vet would give me as flea medication. I usually apply this 2/yr and I know all cats are different so its hard to know whats going to work for them unless you give it a try. Like I said, so far this product has worked for me , so I will continue to use until it stops working fir my kitties.",1
Really disappointed that both tubes of glue are so dry they are unuseable. Unable to rate the actual product since I'm not able to use it.,0
"I'm sure for someone with more experience than I this may be fine. For me, not so much. It is all plastic that moves like a bad garden hose. This made it difficult to get on the dog correctly in the first place. The slides to adjust the tightness were tight against the plastic hosing making it potentially dangerous in my opinion. It wouldn't slide at all and then slid way too much. I'll buy something different.",0
I didn't like this water bottle and neither did my mice. I found that it leaked a lot and my mice didn't seem to like to look straight up to drink.,0
My dog decided he doesn't like these after one treat,0
My budgies absolutely LOVE this stuff.  I am never without it!  I definitely recommend giving oat groats a try with your budgies!  :),1
Misleading product.,0
"Be carefull if switching to blue bufalo. is it high end quality dog food? yes!  f your dog eats it up and digests it, your good to go. but it was not the case for us, and the more research I did the more I seen dogs with the same problems with it. i have a 1 year old female Rottweiler, (sweet as can be). we switched her to this and she ate it but more picked at it. (now if there hungry they will eat it)  big problem was projectile diarrhea, and non stop soft stools. we slowly added it in for almost 3 weeks. and stuck with it for nearly two months, and where consulting with vet as well. I did more research, and seen many people's dog reacted the same to this. but others have no problem . we ended up switching to taste of the wild, cold turkey. fixed her right up.",0
"This EcoFlex Litter Loo was the ABSOLUTE best thing that I have bought for my 2 cats. Simple and Easy for us woman to put together with NO TOOLS! So that was nice. It is:
Easy to clean
Easy to transport/breakdown to take with you to travel

Durable
ONE PROBLEM - (comes in 2 colors white or dark brown)  IF I COULD GIVE THAT LAST STAR A HALF COLOR I WOULD OF",1
doesn't really work,0
I have 2 poodles that are both extremely picky about what they eat.  One will sniff every bite.  I have tried many different brands of dry dog food and they wouldn't even touch it.  They would rather not eat than to eat dry food.  This brand changed that.  They happily gobble it up.  It is also healthy for them.  I am extremely satisfied with this dog food and would recommend it to others.,1
"Good strong quality, bright color and great fit",1
"Needs clasps to hook over the top of an enclosure since it radiates heat down. I had to use hook bungee tie downs to hold it in place. Needs improvement in design, especially for the price.",0
The pads work very well.  They are absorbent and there is never any leakage.  Our dog got use to them very quickly.,1
Great item,1
"Got a new tank and was trying to cycle (with Tetra SafeStart), using these strips to check for ammonia. But, scale resolution is not fine enough, but worse give very inaccurate results - it was indicating nothing, but was actually 1.0! Test strip color changes dramatically depending upon what light you are looking at it under (especially fluorescent vs incandescent - looked green vs light brown).
Skip this and go for the real dropper test kit - it about the same price and waaaay more accurate.",0
My inside cat doesnt like it so I gave it to strays I feed and they didn't care for it..Only the ones that look like bones liked it.,0
"This was by far the best by when it comes to this particular type of bird seed I got the biggest amount for the best price.  Thank you.

 Excellent customer service for the worst I always ask people to please Google Dr Fagelman assault.  I was a victim of violence and lies  so please help the video go viral.

I have PTSD  and one little relief is feeding the birds",1
"I purchased two, one for my 17lb dachshund and one for my 10lb dachshund. I decided to test them out in the bathtub before taking the girls out on the boat and thank God I did. It floats however it rolled them over forcing them to be belly up and head under water! So in the event of an accident if I were unable to hold them upright the would be dead to question about it! I put mine in the trash!!",0
"Has a rather interesting and pleasant deep woodsy scent and it doesn't take much to mark whatever it is you want to protect. However, for my dogs (A Maltese and a Scottish/Jack Russell Terrier mix), this spray doesn't work. Spray our couch down, and 5 minutes later they are both sleeping on it. Shame because I had high hopes for this after reading the reviews. I know others have had better luck. Every dog is different. It was worth a try.",0
The container is larger than I had invisioned but you certainly do not have to fill it up to brim.  Better than using a watering bowl,1
"I bought this for my 49 lb border collie/spaniel mix. The first thing I noticed is that it sits VERY low to the ground--I know it is supposed to be low, but when my puppy [he actually is done growing, but I still call him my puppy :)] sat in it, his butt immediately hit the ground.  I even purchased the Large which fits up to a 100 lb. dog. This is very disappointing and I would return it, if I could.  I think this may be better suited for a SMALL dog (read: lightweight), regardless of the size bed you purchase.  Buyer beware.",0
Very sturdy product for the price.,1
Didn't work.,0
Easy to assemble with two people.  It is just what is needed for my Dog,1
"My cats have never once scratched this, and even if they tried, it slides around. It is cute though.",0
My favorite stuff for my hermit crabs. They really love it and that is most important.,1

"Wanted this as an interactive toy to get my overly curious and energetic sphynx to slow down his eating.
He did not like sticking his paw in it and ended up just flipping it over if he got that hungry.
Also note that sphynx have webbed feet and he did not like getting the food out of his webs in order to eat it

I suggest a large treat ball with food if you want an interactive way to slow your cat down from eating.",0

"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!",0
Works great. We have a cat that prefers to stay outside and needed a water bowls that wouldn't freeze. So far it has met all my expectations.,1
"My cats loved the 3 pack of sardines, but wouldn't even touch this.",0
EXCELLENT,1
"I purchased this to replace an old platinum drinkwell that performed well for years.  I felt that the drinkwell was difficult to clean and fill, and like the idea that this was stainless steel so less apt to harbor mold and bacteria.  In my view, any benefit gained from the stainless bowel is negated by the plastic pump and pump enclosure. I feel that there are plenty of nooks and crannies for bacteria and mold to grow in this area, as well as the plastic sleeve that the water bubbles up through (this sleeve is not removable, as far as I can tell, and therefore impossible to fully clean).

Another issue that I had with the fountain involved its capacity. I have a 10 pound Cairn Terrier and a 16 year old cat using the fountain. It took 2 days of hard work to coax my dog into using it.  Once both pets were using it, I found that I could not leave the fountain unattended for more than a day as the water would be too low to keep the pump going. If we were going to be gone overnight, I had to unplug it and leave an alternate water supply. To me, this is a deal breaker. I use this mainly so that my pets will have fresh water when I am not available.

There is no disconnect on the line. In order to turn it off, it must be unplugged from the wall.  Therefore, I must locate the fountain in an area that I can easily reach the outlet to service the fountain.

Today, after using the fountain for approximately 5 months, I plugged it in and it blew the breaker. Tried it elsewhere - it blew that breaker.  It has obviously developed some type of electrical issue.

If there was anything that I liked about this fountain at all, I would try to get it fixed or replaced.  As it is, I am thankful that the issue came up while I was at home, and that neither of my critters were harmed (and that my house didn't burn down).

I just ordered another drinkwell platinum.  To me, it's worth the 30 minutes that it takes to clean and fill (I use bottled water - I'm sure it wouldn't be such a problem to fill if filled from the sink) to get rid of all of the problems that I listed above.",0
I am using your product at least twice a day on my Husky and he constantly shreds his hair.  Little by little I am removing less hair.  Product is great..thanks for making it easier to brush him..Ed,1
"My cat LOVES this thing. He gets excited when he sees it, stretches out when you start brushing one side and then flops over to his other side (essentially saying, ""Don't miss this spot!"") and generally squirms with glee. Morpheus also likes having his head brushed, but is a little dopey, so he constantly comes at the brush eyes-first. I have to hold his excited little head still to safely brush him without poking him in the eye. I was concerned when I bought this that the wire was too pointy and might cause some discomfort, but Morphy clearly feels nothing but the utmost pleasure. Cleaning the brush is simple - just be sure to press the center of the button otherwise some of the bristles get left behind on one of the sides.

Bonuses: He doesn't shed a lot since he gets brushed regularly, and I have yet to see him cough up a single hairball since I got him 3 and a half months ago.",1
Very cool for beardies but he rarely uses it. Great size.,1
"These denigrated in the tank. Broke up into small pieces and clogged the filter system several times. Love the way they look. It may have been our cichlids picking them apart. Either way, we can't use them again.",0

"Finally found a harness my dog doesn't mind me putting on her. She is a Shiatsu 9lbs and has nipped at me on every other harness I tried on her. This one slips right over her head and buckles on the sides with ease, and no nipping from the dog! I can pick her up easily with the handle and not choke her or have her slip out as some people have reviewed.",1
"Our 8 pound dog will wet on these pads ""several"" times all day long, and they DO NOT LEAK! Hallelujah!!",1

"Your cat will love this toy.  Having 6 cats this is the best exercise my cats get daily.  Comes in two pieces for easy storage and your cats will know where you store this toy of theirs.  The toy gets your cat up and moving trying to catch it and run with it.  Da Bird is Da Best for ever for cats of all ages and sizes, especially those over weight cats. Fun for both you and your cats.  You will get great pictures of your cat leaping 3 feet off the floor to try and catch Da Bird.",1

"How can something that's so simple in concept be executed so horribly. The idea of a potty pad holder was elementary enough that I thought I would just purchase whichever one fits the pads I currently own. This product is flimsy, hard to use as the sides that lock the pad in font fit together properly unless you have it at a precise angle (not s problem you can afford when trying to remove a pee soaked pad). And this isn't even the cheapest on offered on Amazon! Do yourself a favor and buy a potty pad holder (they are lifesavers) just don't get this one!",0
Smells to strong,0
"My dog loved this food, but her stool because so loose and watery that we couldn't feed it to her after a couple of days.
I wish it could have worked out :(",0
"I bought this after reading a few reviews. Wish I would have read more. This product is not good for puppies. The bottom is only velcroed in. My dog got out of it the first time we put him in. I have tried to sew it, duct tape it, and staple gun it. He gets out of it everytime. I would buy a metal crate for a puppy. Which I probably have to buy now.",0
I have used a lot of dog cologne sprays on dogs over the years and this is by far the most pleasant and long lasting spray that I have ever used. Excellent product!,1

Came way too small other than that it was really cute,0
Just as good as capstar without the price.,1

This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one in September and it's already kaput!  They just do not last!  The fountain goes to a trickle and then just stops working.  I keep the water level high and I have cleaned it out regularly.  I shall not be buying a third!  My geriatric cats will just have to make do with an old fashioned dish!,0

A friend of mine who is a dog groomer recommended this to me.  I use it regularly on my 75lb German Shepard after I give her a bath it definitely cuts the blow drying time in half and leaves her coat soft.  This stuff smells great ,1
"Purchased this August 2016 and have been using it since.  Wish I would have purchased it sooner.  It takes seconds to sit in the window frame.  The ability to lock the cat door is great.  It leads to 12 X 12 enclosed catio (we have coyotes and mountain lions) and I can set it before dark so when the cats come back in, they cant go back out (they frequently bring in mice if they are out at dark).  We live in South Dakota and when we do get brutal freezing wind on those days, I actually remove it and close the window because of the cold.  We sometimes get hard rain with heavy winds and I have to remove it for those times too because water will get in.  The only way to avoid that is actually do a profesional ""built in"" which would probably run into the thousands.  I truly have no complaints about it.  I purchased a ""small"" one and my largest cat cannot get out - but that was on purpose.  I think the price is a bit high, I suspect the cost of materials and to manufacture is probably only $20, if that, but I knew the cost before purchasing and made the decision because I really wanted it.  I would definitely buy it again - was exactly as described.",1
so glad I didn't have to buy a whole new door  never realized how important the doggie door was until it broke there was a huge tempatute difference in the room where doggie door is  it broke on Saturday evening we had a new  one by Tuesday morning  would have had it on Monday however it was a holiday very happy with product,1
Perfect collar for my dog to make sure they get home safely if lost. Love that its customizable.,1
I either got a defective product or this thing just sucks. I was thinking this was a soft rubber type but its a very hard plastic. My dog isn't interested in this at all and its it heavy and annoying for my cat to enjoy. I will be returning this product. If you're interested in toys that will keep your animals entertained try the Premire treat toys.,0
Another West Paw hit! Dogs love this toy and it is very tough!,1
Our cats love them,1
Does not work.  The Supersonic setting does not seem to have any affect on the barking dogs.  It is a waste of money.,0
"My dog loves these. Although, to be honest, he'd eat just about anything so its hard to gauge just how much he likes these. The shorter ones work better for two reasons: 1) he's seems content after eating one so there is no need for the larger size and 2) he tends to run around the house with these in his mouth. The larger ones clip the walls, furniture, and my kids. No such issues with the shorter ones.",1
"I found a tick on my cat's face about 25 days after I dosed him behind his neck with Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control, but it wasn't a very happy tick.  It looked like it had disgorged some blood and wasn't burrowed into my cat's skin.  In fact, the tick was more than happy to transfer its affections to me before I picked it off and squashed it with a paper towel.

I'm assuming the tick was repelled by the Frontline Plus, since I'd never seen one behave like that before.  Usually they burrow in until they're gorged with blood, but this one was thin and unhappy.

So, I'm going to keep using Frontline Plus on the two cats that go outside.",1
"I had the exact same experience as the other reviewer! I received the small cans when I believed I was ordering the large cans. I assumed I must have made a mistake and kept the smaller cans, because I just didn't want to deal with returning it, but now I am wondering... (The food is great by the way, so this is not a reflection on the product.)",0
Definitely isn't unscented but has a mild clean scent.  Seems to get rid of odors pretty well though.,1
So far so good,1
"This seller advertises in word and by photo that she is selling ""Frontline Plus."" The product shipped was ""Frontline Combo"" manufactured in the United Kingdom. Although the active ingredients are the same, it is illegal to sell this in the USA. In addition to this problem, she told me she sent it on 07/22. Based on the shipping label, she must have forgotten to mail it. After contacting her as to why it had not been received yet, she said she would ""resend"" it. If this actually had been resent, then why does the shipping label have the date of 07/22/2011 on it?  I ordered from this person because she had a 98% satisfaction rate. Guess in the future I will note that a rating may not show that the seller is doing something legal and that I must be careful.",0
I bought these supplements for my sister to try for her dachshund. He has really dry skin and always wants to scratch. She says he really likes them and she has no trouble getting him to take them. It does seem to be improving his skin issues!,1
"Our new dog pulls like a train and is stronger than I could manage with a regular leash. A dog trainer friend recommended this product and it works like a charm. The neck end is the brakes and the chest end is the steering wheel to redirect her when she starts to bound off to greet another dog out for a walk. If you have a big dog, weak arms/shoulders, or both, I highly recommend this leash.",1
does not stand up too limp water spills -,0
"Of course, I haven't tried this myself... but my very picky pooch refuses to eat these.  Very disappointed that I spent so much money on it.  Wish I could return it.",0
The cats love it,1
As described,1
Just as expected.  Great price.  Shipment on time.  Sturdy.  Appropriate for our 15 pound ShiPoo.  Weather resistant and strong enough for a dog twice the size.,1
I did not receive what the picture shows. I got some figure 8 strap that does not work for me. And the leather is very thin and flimsy. Disappointed.,0
We had been using another more expensive brand which my cats adore. We tried this brand and one cat really does not care for it at all but the other likes it...so I guess we will be ordering 2 different brands from now on.,0
No use for me.,0
My dog would not eat these!,0

"I was nervous about making this purchase after reading so many negative reviews and it being only rated 3 stars. However, when the price dropped (pretty considerably) I bought two. The price was also a deterring factor since I needed two.
I have not taken measurements of how much food actually gets dropped, and I have not made any crazy modifications to it. I did make a small modification however: my cats would pull the bowl out of the unit looking for more food (as well as reaching their paws up into the unit dropping more food) but this was easily remedied by using a piece of duct tape on the bottom of the unit (I will attach a photo). They don't do anything else to get into the feeder for more food. (Other than knocking over the entire unit one time).
I initially set the feeders to 1/4c. twice a day (5 am/5pm), but my cat was getting really fussy around lunch time and late evening. Since my cats do not eat all of the food at once I decided to increase how much food they get. Since there is no 1/3c. option on the feed I set one feeder to drop 1/4c. and the other 1/2c. This works well since, as I mentioned, they do not finish the food all at once anyway. This stopped the fussing between meal times.
These feeders have been a great experience for me and I'm extremely satisfied with them. My older cat would wake me up between 4 and 5 am to be fed, but now I can sleep through the night. I can go out and rest assured that my cats are being fed and no longer have to worry about getting home to feed them which is such a huge relief. I would recommend these feeders to any cat owner, and it's best to start out when they're young.",1
"The picture looks like a chicken, but in actuality it is a bunny costume.  However, very cute bunny!!!  And great price!!  It is a white furry bunny with pink in the ears and a little tail.  Has an attached hood--hence the ears.  Snaps under the belly and around the neck, also adjustable snaps under the hind legs.  I bought a size small for my almost 6 lb yorkie and it is a little big on her.  She measures approx. 12"" from the base of her neck to her butt, and approx. 12' girth and 8"" around her neck.  So cute!",1
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this seat cover. It was exactly what I needed and wanted when taking my dog to the few places I do (grandmother's house to stay, the groomers, or the vet). He loves riding up front with me, and I would rather he mess up one seat and window space instead of my whole back seat and two windows. ;) This is easy to put on and take off and washes. I have used it in a car and SUV and it has fit both even though the seats are totally different sizes.",1
"Had this in my car for about 3 months of very lite use. Took it out to wash it and the backing had disintigrated into a powder that I had to vacuum out of my car. I'm guessing it was the UV from being exposed by the back window but, it was the backing not the exposed cover! And I live in W. Washington. Not exactly Death Valley here. The fit was barely adequite (99 Altima) and there was no chance that the seat belt access holes were usable with my car. Spend your money elsewhere.",0
I used this to stop my neighbor's dog from barking within 20 feet and it did nothing.  I brought it inside to train my dog to stop barking when somone comes to visit.  My dog was within 2 feet of it and it did not phase her.  Do not buy this product.,0

"We have been using this litter for our 2 ferrets and our 2 pet rats litter box. Both use this litter with (separate cages) no problems. It absorbs their odors very well and seems to keep their respiratory tracks clear which is very important for ferrets and rats. Both can have major respiratory problems with the wrong beddings or litters. This has been working perfect for both. We have now been using it for many years now and buy it in the grocery stores. There is no dust but it does break down to crumbs with repeated use in urine areas, like my ferrets use the same corners over and over and so do the rats. I just scoop the corners out, then spread fresh litter to the corners of the litter boxes to keep them clean longer.",1
"ESA Access Card clearly states Federal Law rights to airlines and housing granted by Federal Law.

"I've purchased both the aqueon changer and the competing python product.  I was originally dissatisfied with the python because it sprayed so much while draining I had to cover my faucet with a towel.  This was despite replacing the plastic thread attachment with the brass one as mentioned by many reviewers.  So I decided to give the Aqueon changer a chance.  For the first month it was perfect.  The hose is a little tight and the coils are hard to fight, but at first I didn't think anything of this.  I think the slight pulling may have something to do with my problems though.  After two months, the nozzle suffered a catastrophic failure and the side stem broke off behind the threads.  I ran through the house to the kitchen in record time, but the damage was done.  Water had sprayed everywhere!  Given the positive reviews, I decided that I must've received a defective one and saw that replacement nozzles were super inexpensive, so rather than fighting customer service of what amounts to an 8 dollar part, I just bought the replacement.  It worked perfectly!  For 4 months... and then the top stem broke off behind the thread.  Once again, my kitchen was soaked.

I was in a bind and needed a water changer quickly, so I, against better judgement, had a second replacement valve sent in.  Just to make me feel special and add insult to injury, this one broke during the first use in the same way.

Now, I have a fairly low water pressure in my kitchen.  It's just enough to get slow, usable suction with the water changer from my tank which is only 12 feet away from the kitchen, so I have to consider that the plastic piece is just structurally weak.

I will say though, that Aqueon Customer Service has been first rate and gave me the option of receiving replacement parts or a refund.  They have agreed to fully refund the purchase of the full changer and the two replacement nozzles, and have handled my complaint very quickly.  I usually find that their other products are top-rated, but I think the water valve is just poorly engineered.",0
"Sturdy and we'll made. We have a 42 pound Lab/Boxer who is 10 months old. She is a puller and loves sprinting after Birds, Squirrels and the occasional leaf. She has gone through 2 soft harnesses in 4 months so we decided to go with Chai's Choice. Perfect. Easy to adjust and she is very comfortable in it.",1
Slow fleas down for a couple of days at most.  Retreated after 2 weeks.  Going back to Frontline Plus so my girls can have some relief!!,0
"Not made very well, the plush comes off easily.",0
good,1
"Used this one time as directed in the evening and my lovely healthy fantail was dead in the morning.  I can't see any other reason why fish would have died?  Stick to water changes weekly and skip these waste of money, fish killers.",0
"After trying several different boots, these are absolutely the best! My 12-year old German Shepard drags her hind toes, and these are rugged enough that they give her toe protection and have lasted well over a month before wear on the toecap of the boots started appearing. Other boots lasted a week or less. She can run in these and they stay on. I highly recommend them!",1
I have bought this bed multiple times. Just bought a few more - one for my home office and another for a bedroom so my golden retriever has a comfy bed in every room to hang out with me.,1
"I bought the Springer because it looked like a great idea.  My dog needed to run off extra energy and I could get exercise at the same time.  The first time my dog and I used the Spring together it was fine (we were both nervous).  The second time, my dog was more relaxed and not paying as much attention.  My dog was on my right side and saw a dog on my left.  She darted to the left and pulled me off balance.  I flew off the bike and ended up with a compression fracture to the ball of my upper arm and tore my rotator cuff.  My dog is only 40 pounds and I am 160 pounds so the weight of the dog was not a factor.  It is not as safe as they say, so please use caution.",0
The shirt is well made. Corgi looks smart wearing it but didn't do anything much for him. I can't say I saw a difference. He must that 20%...,0
The top loading door is useless. The entire thing comes off. The hinges don't stay closed. If you put a 10 lb cat in here the whole top bows and it looks like the 2nd door will come of.  Cannot carry by handle due to this. I have to go buy something else.  Maybe if you have just. Kitten it would be fine for a while.,0
I bought this item and have had nothing but trouble with it. It don't work like it should. Stuff sticks to the rakes and it gets clogged and jammed all the time,0
Our dog loves this bed! The night we got it for him he didn't get up for hours. It is huge so plenty of room for him and my 4 yr old! I have already washed it once and it came out just perfect. Pretty easy to put back on. Only just a little awkward w how big it is but no big deal. Would def buy one of these again.,1
"It was so large. It stated for a small dog about 12 pounds.  She wore it a few times and it was so
big we did not use anymore.  In that short time the stones were already falling out.",0
No dear on the paint or anything yet. Easy to clean. Looks cool in our little 10 gal. tank,1
Fine,1
"So these things look cool and they seem alright at first but after you've had them in your tank for awhile there's this white stuff that comes off of them, and when you take them out to clean them they have a very strong tar like smell, I've taken them out of my tank completely. I have cichlid's and these things seem to make them sickly. I wouldn't buy it. My mom bought some as well, she has a goldfish tank, and the same thing happened.",0
"This is the second time I had ordered this item. The first few times it was a problem since the size was extremely reduced and my dog was able to fit the XL. Now that I ordered it again the XL came in as the ""true bigger"" size. This is ridiculous..",0
"I stopped feeding my cats Science Diet because it contained a lot of grain.  The cats love this stuff, and it's healthy!",1
Chewed right threw it,0
"This is not a ""small"" toy. It is huge, and would not be appropriate for anything smaller than a labrador retriever.",0
"We bought this cage to use for pet rats. Its not really a good cage for rats though. We've had success keeping rats in it but we had one rat that figured out how to wiggle through the bars and would run around the house in the middle of the night. We would spend an hour or more to capture her and she'd be back running around the house 10 minutes later. The bars are not ideal for keeping rats inside unless you have some big fat rats. Smaller rats will be able to slip right out if they feel like it. The cage itself is great. It's design is simple and easy to put together. It folds down for easy storage. Its sturdy and easy to clean. The metal wires clip into the bottom tray so they don't come apart. Its a really nice size too. The wires have a white coating on them and some animals will chew the bars and the white coating comes off. I am not sure if that is harmful or not. Overall I do like the cage and would recommend it to others. Just beware small rats do not work well for this particular product.
I try to make my reviews engaging and useful. Please click the helpful button if you thought this review was of some help. Thanks!",1
This didn't work with my puppy.,0
This product did not work at all.,0
Super bummed. The first set we ordered are amazing and dry well. This size does not/ the back peels and you are left with black pieces in your dryer every time!,0
I love this toy! It has lasted 8 months with my husky and pitsky! I won't buy another brand!,1
Very good design for what it's for easy installation  but it needs something extra to help hold it together especially if you have young and/or multiple dogs otherwise I highly recommend it,0
I actually use this as a feeding method for my food aggressive cat. It works wonderfully.,1
Arrived and works in our fountains,1
"This is a scam. The duck sent is cheap, small, florescent yellow and clearly not as described. Do not order.",0
My cat had digestive issues when I first adopted him but he hasn't had any problems since I switched him to this formulation. He's a couple of years too young for this formula but it seems to work well for him. I highly recommend this product.,1
"started peeling the first month...I have now had it for 4 months and the inside of the bowl is peeling even worse and I will now have to find another one like my old one , right now it I had to remove as it does not look safe for my dogs!!!! .do not recommend this product",0
Received before the expected date with all the correct information on the tag. Great product!,1
Don't waste your money on these products. Phosphates and Nitrates never budged.,0
"Great leash. Leather is terrific, supple not hard and stiff. Great price, this will last forever.",1
"This dress wasn't even on my little girl ( the most adorable pug in the world ), when it started fraying, and one little itch and it had a hole in it. But it also started coming unsewen at the seams. It's adorable and I'm sure I just got a bad apple out of the barrel but, at the price of puppy clothes they have to be tough, and adorable.",0
My cat loves these treats...but vomits every time I give them to her.,0
My usual topical treatment for my lil guy.  Came very well packed.,1
Both our cats love it since it has the greens in it I think . Nice to see they clean their plates up ( over the day ),1
Great quality. Tall sides for added doggy comfort.,1
"Excellent, excellent, excellent! Did I say excellent? I have one of these pumps between 2 tanks and it pumps out plenty of air when the power goes out. Pump is quiet, batteries are not expensive, look for them on the internet. You can pick up replacement batteries for under $10....look around. This pump does it's own charging and I also keep a spare battery on a separate charger so I'll have plenty of power if and when I need it. A fresh fully charged battery keeps this pump running for a good 4-6 hours.....and that is on full power....you can set it for intermittent power and the battery will last even longer. Nice pump to have on hand, it really works well.",1
"Bought over a year ago, this has been used on everything from doctoring horse and cattle wounds to grooming ranch dogs. Have replaced the blade only once. I love it!",1
"I was a bit leery about ordering this stand given the negative reviews about shipping/packaging and missing parts.  I ordered it anyway.  The stand is ok, though it does have some rust visible from various screw holes.  The packaging is the worst I have ever seen in all my years of ordering via the internet and from Amazon in general.  Surprisingly, all the parts were included and undamaged.  The bird seems to be hanging securely away from toddlers and my dogs (my main concern), but the jury is still out on the product.  We may still return it.  I would not recommend this bird stand to anyone, even for the inexpensive price.

UPDATE:  Ten months after purchasing this stand, we are satisfied with it. It has held up and the bird is secure.",0
Not very sturdy. Pup chewed the plastic covers where the leash cord is bound together.  But helpful to have when my arthritic hands are stiff and attaching our other leash to her collar slows down getting her outside.  Can slip the leash over her head quickly.,0
"I received these today and I used the amount instructed on box, it clouded my tank a yellow color! Will not use these a second time!",0
"Would like to go LOWER than the single star.  This cage is junk and dangerous to ferrets!  The welds in the metal cage floor wires broke away from the structure tubing making small ""spears"" to cause serious wounds to or kill your animals.  My return date is past, so i'll throw it away, since if I sold it used, it would hurt the buyer,s animals.",0
"My Lab loves these, but he's more gentle with stuffed toys than most dogs of his size. They're a great price for a 4-pack, so we gave a couple as gifts too. The colors are quite a bit lighter than the pic looks on my computer, but that doesn't matter to my dog.",1
Works surprisingly well.,1
"I ordered with my two older dogs in mind but it turns out to be more popular with cats and very petite children for perching.  The material is nice, very soft and so far doesn't seem to attract fur.  Cover is removable but I would hate trying to put it back on.  Intending to spot clean only.  It's foam but sturdy enough for intended purpose.  A bit pricey but all products of this nature seem to be.",1
"Gets slimy, washing it every few days. The filter maybe three weeks, cost about $2 each.. The thin plastic reserve tank gets condensation and smells. The plastic body is way thinner than we expected. I scoop out the water before lifting to clean, because Im afraid it will crack. I cleaned by hand in the sink hoping to maintain the seals.  Very awkward , youll need small cleaning brushes  to get into small places. Its a nice idea, just a real cheaply made.",0
"My dogs would not touch this, despite so many other great reviews.  Nothing wrong with it, but they wouldn't lay a paw on it.",0
"I needed a good chain for my medic alert and this fit the bill, the only problem was that the end would not close as it is smashed together and and can't be separated without destroying it.  But I would still recommend this chain to anyone who needs it as it is a good chain.",0
My dog got it off right away and carried the rolled up mess around before I took it from her. There are no instruction on using or unwrapping it and it looked old and messed up when I got it. I had to use scissors to try and cut a start piece to wrap on her paw. Totally worthless.,0
"The bowls are great, however they stand broke within hours and dumped water all over the place.  So frustrating....",0
"Did not work on German Shepherd Dog fur. I can get more fur off petting her. Seriously,  I was surprised at how it didn't catch any fur and I'm talking top coat, not under coat. I bought based on other GSD owners reviews. I gave it away to an owner of a Blue Tick hound and Doberman. Side note: None of the dogs liked getting brushed with it.",0
GOOD COMBINATION,1
"I was very pleased with my previous Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow, but purchased a new one when a price on Amazon made it almost as economical to replace the whole unit vs. a worn out pump. The body has been redesigned - the pieces are shaped and fit together differently. I'm not sure whether this design contributes to the problem, which is that this second Petmate fountain is very loud, and regardless of whether the reservoir is full, the water level in the bowl is not maintained at a level to keep the pump from ""sputtering."" The previous fountain was virtually silent; this one can be heard from several rooms away. I have had the manufacturer replace the pump, with no improvement. We will not be purchasing another fountain from Petmate.",0
"My Yorkies love this thing! Well it has officially been taken over by one of them permanently. He is our chunky monkey weighing in at 19 pounds! Anyone with a yorkie knows he's a big boy! I don't think this size would fit much bigger than that, he gets in there and can roll around in it and he sleeps in there too. The cat has occasional given a run through when he's feeling spunky and daring too. You can use the snaps to make it curved, but my dogs do not prefer that. It also can be closed back up but it never quite gets at tightly closed as when you initially get it. But it is  good enough to store it away if needed.",1
"Awesome tags!  I ordered two, one for each dog.  They are actually engraved, not printed.  The tag itself is relatively thick, so I am hoping they will be durable as well.  On the back of the tag there is a small reflective sticker so you can see your pet in low light conditions.  Nice touch!  Overall, I am quite satisfied with this purchase.  I will update if any of the above assessments change.

UPDATE:  It has been six months, and the tags are still in great shape.  Little scratches are noticeable on close inspection of the tags (I keep the rabies vaccination tags on the collar too, so that's probably where the scratches are from), but that's about it.  The reflective sticker on the back is still intact.  I am still very pleased with this purchase.",1
"The collar worked for about 36 hrs. and then quit working. I returned the collar after emailing the company several times in order to get the return address. I received a new collar which has worked so far ( a week). I believe the key to maintaining it functioning is to take the batteries out every night or when not in use. If I could do it again, I would just spend the extra money for a good collar.",0
We are the owners of four dogs who are home alone while we work. We wanted to be able to keep the out of the bedroom area and in the main part of our house. The gate works perfected to block the hallway leading to the bead room while still be easy to move and stay out of the way while not in use. It was easy to install and easy to use.,1
This is the dumbest design by people who have nothing else to do.,0
"This lasted less than one day, was turned into a pile of pieces by our two yellow labs. We also have the frog, which has lasted 3+ years with no damage (heck, even its squeaker still functions!) Thought it would be fun to get another Jel, so each dog could have one to play with at the same time. No such luck.",0
"I would not recommend this product. The wheel has worked well and it has a tab on the bottom to prevent it from twisting in the slot that it slides into. The tower however does not! I tried tying it up straight, but that didn't twirl either. Eventually I put it through one of the holes in the top of the cage, it works but it still isn't a good fit. THEN I took the little sleep house off to clean it for the first time and it snapped off instead of releasing from the flexible ring that holds it on. If you are poking for a quality addition to your cage then this is not for you!",0
Well it work good but it still leaves some old hair in my cat.,1
This stuff is magic.  Cleans my white poodle even at his dirtiest.,1
Great Product! Quick Delivery!!!,1
This is by far the easiest way to give dogs a bath. My two toy fox terrier puppies love bath time now. I recommend this product to all animal lovers,1
Used for a week and it broke,0
"Really upset... I bought this for my cat's first birthday. I was expecting something more durable since the toy featured a wire/metal ""string.""  However, within the first hour of playing, the wire snapped. I was so sad and disappointed because my cat loved the toy while it lasted.",0
It scoops poop.,1
"I want give 0 star, first if all I ordered 1 came 2, 1 was broken, I wanted return it, the company never responded.the ultrasonic didn't work for my dog, the instructions are not clear, it says that just the dog can hear, maybe my dog is deaf.",0
"I noticed some fleas on my cat and bought this to save some money. Bad idea. I applied it and 3 days later gave her a combing. More than a dozen fleas. The next day I found about 20. It's doing nothing to them.

The annoying thing is that I can't give her a new topical treatment until a month after I gave her this. I'm looking at oral options, but in the meantime, I've had to resort to twice daily flea combing, lots of vacuuming, and lots of laundry. I hope I can make a dent.",0
"While it serves its purpose well it's simply of poor quality. The plastic is very light weight and soft. My dog was barely chewing it (nanny cam lol),more of a mindless soft boredom chew one he drank all the water.",0
"We love this little bed! We have a 15-year-old silky terrier who's started sleeping in enclosed spaces. We were always having to make sure he wasn't getting locked into bedrooms, closets, and even bathroom cabinets. Now all I have to do is look in his little bed in there he is. It's a little small so if you're  pet is more than 10 or 12 pounds you may want to consider something else.  The doorway is pretty low and he had some doubts, but once I shoved him through the opening the first time he was hooked! The only drawback is that the pillow inside isn't attached to the bottom. We solved this with a little bit of Velcro and now it works great! I highly recommend this product",1
It didn't  worked at all.,0
One of the many bargains on Amazon.,1
"This is honestly great. It fits my dog great, and is good quality for such a cheap price! Totally recommend and would buy again!",1
"Definitely measure your dog and order a size up from what the chart shows. This shirt shrank after washing. And yes, I followed the ""care instructions.""",0
"have boughtr  4 heavy duty tie out cables and the clips on the end broke on all of them, my dog is a small dog,then he runs
all over town and I sometimes have to pay fines if hes caught  before he comes home. I have to buy my cables somewhere  else",0
"My dog loves KONGS....I fill this with peanut butter and freeze it, that keeps her busy for a while.",1
"This blanket is SO soft and absolutely adorable! Big enough for my dog, but small enough for him to drag it around the house.",1
"My dogs are very picky and never eat pills, vitamins or anything in-between. It doesn't matter what i try to cover them in. I can put these right with their dinner and they don't seem to mind at all. It hasn't been long enough for me to see any effects from them but with 1000 in each bottle I think I will be able to tell before it's empty.",1
Smell nice,1
I expected more for what I paid & received was not impressed by the UV black light will not buy another.,0
The side door came bent/difficult to latch. Other than that it works well.,0
"Our bird loves this activity center, keeps her from getting bored.  Gives her variety.",1
best thing and cheapest treatments,1
"Stupid cat immediately started chewing and eating the rubber mesh this thing is made of and amazon wants $10 from me for shipping to return it, guess it's going in the trash.",0
This item is super big. I mean BIG. The multiple dog use of this item makes it great but for 2 smaller dogs this is overkill.,0
Love it,1
"I purchased the brush kit when I purchased the Big Dog Drinkwell Fountain...in December 2008. I agree that the brushes are very poorly designed and do not recommend anyone to waste their money on them. The small brush doesn't reach and after only about 3 months, the wire reinforcement started to break, so now I have a limp crappy brush at best. The long skinny brush is okay for the pump. The large brush is not at all useful and from lack of use, the spongy end is breaking down from dry-rot. I use a toothbrush and papertowels to clean it, because like others, I believe my pets deserve a clean drinking fountain. That's why I purchased it! Maybe someone will finally let the company know about our feedback, after all, isn't that the purpose of it...to improve quality?",0
"This stump is probably 1/2 the thickness of the stump I purchased at my local big box pet store,
Yes this product is cheaper but with it being so thin this thing spends more time on its side that standing up,
Both of my guinea just walk over and knock it over, which they cannot do with the thicker, heavier one,",0
Chewed apart in an hour. Might be better for a very small dog.,0
"I honestly thought this was a little pricey when I ordered it but once I used it could tell it was worth every penny. We like how it feels in our hand and that it stretches a bit to save our hands when our border collie decides to take off. Oh, and the bright colors are beautiful.",1
My dog LOVES these balls. He usually and easily breaks any ball I have given him and has yet to break these ones.,1
"All I can say is that my dog really enjoys it,  She hid it the first day I gave it to her and some times you can catch her chewing on pieces of it.",1
"I bought the puppy dental kit
 because of good reviews. The brush was destroyed after just one use. He ended up ingesting the broken bristles. I do not recommend this.",0
"It got all fuzzy with pilling after about a week because the dog would scratch her neck, other collars have not done this.",0
I can hear this thing clear across my house. It is awful! Obnoxious buzzing noise that will wake your neighbors. It is far to powerful for a betta tank at 1-3 gallons. Bettas do not like fast moving water. It turned my tank into a whirlpool. waste of money. Also this comes with a seperate motor from the filter that you have to mount on a shelf above the tank? Really? What a horrible eyesore.,0
great!,1
It didn't work at all for my two retrievers even after 2 1/2 months,0
"You have to dump each piece into trash before picking up the next pile... i wish it had a chamber where it could be while uou go to pick i

I bought this and the cans were expired resulting in a vomiting cat!!! I hope someone contacts me so I can return the last few cans. Btw these expired 12/2015.,0
Birds and squirrels love it.,1
Quite possibly the best cat toy I've ever purchased. both of our cats have yet to tire of this. They chase it around the house and love playing with it and us!,1
"I have a picky cat, and she refuses to eat these treats. I found them as an add-on for 79 cents so I'm not too mad about trying them out.",0
"This product is truly odor-free!  Our Black Lab puppy had a terrible dandruff problem, but now has a nice soft, silky, dandruff-free coat.  I give her two pumps in the morning (she is still under 50 lbs), and that does the trick.  It is mixed in with her food and she has no problem gulping it down as usual (but then what lab does).",1
"Our dog loves this, we think he drinks more water because he enjoys using it and he doesn't get his face whiskers all wet as when we used a water bowl.",1
Sturdy enough to handle the job.,1
"I combine this with the Royal Canine Mini Aging Dry Food for my 15 3/4 year old longhair dachshund--he LOVES it, and won't eat if there is none added to his dry food. I reorder regularly--can't be without it!",1
Great quality food. Cats love it.,1
Ordered 50w received 100w. Will wait to see if it gets too hot.,0
this product is made very well it did cost like $90 however if you don't have the correct doorway it doesnt work...i returned it,0
"My dog chomped the outer ring almost immediately, but he's a pretty destructive guy. He also got frustrated with this one. He does much better with his big Kong wobbler, which has held up for years.",0
"Good nutritious cat food, but my cats weren't really into it.",1
"Great value, fantastic attachment for side of crate",1
Not very good about keeping pets in the back. Very slippery for pets. I needed something more for barrier purposes.,0
Havent used it yet but it looks beautiful. I bought the matching collar. They seem sturdy so I hope they hold up,1
Not practical at all.,0
lamp make a nice TV lamp - cool thing -,1
"The collars of course are only 3/4"" I think they should be 1"" wide like most larger collars.  Also I would like the  leashes to be at least another foot.  I thought I could get by, but it's just not long enough for everyday walks.  I use it as just an extra for emergencies... not an every day collar and leash.  But the color is very pretty.  Just as pictured.",0
Our dog had diarrhea for several weeks after only 2 doses and she's a hound. It was unreal. Stay away from this stuff.,0
"I use it on dogs barking in the car, it sucks...one sings every Queen song  for god's sake.",1
Tried other brands came back to this. Seems more like milk and our abandoned kitten we are raising preferred this brand also. Worth the price for a healthy kitten.,1
PLASTIC.....VERY POOR INSTRUCTIONS,0
"I bought this for my 15 year old male cat who has stopped grooming himself. My vet tells me that this is normal. However, he has plenty of mats which he gets very quickly.

I tried this about 8 times and my cat has yelled at me each time. The blades look sharp and I am careful not to touch his skin. I know the principle is to slowly work your way into the mat but it seems that in a short time that I am pulling on his hair.

I am going to have to find a professional groomer.

An update - I had my cat groomed by a professional. She told me that as cats age, their skin grows thinner. This may be the greatest mat remover there is - for younger cats and, I assume, younger dogs. If you have an older animal, you may want to think twice about this brush.",0
I have 4 cats and they all refused to eat these.  With that many cats turning it down I tasted one myself and it tasted like it was made entirely of salt.  Disgusting.,0
"Worked well for a little while however you have to refill water twice as soon as you would with a normal water feeder. There is a constant water noise that didn't bother us much or the dogs. It got really dirty really easily and every week I was having to take it all apart and scrub. Ended up throwing it out, won't buy again.",0
This product was recommended by a friend.  I am very happy with the results! It was shipped quickly and always in perfect condition.  I have a 13 yo schnauzer- her breath was terrible and we found her breath to be improve greatly! Our pups teeth are doing great!  Very happy with the product.,1
Never really worked. We bought a plecostomus after buying this failed product and it cleaned the algae 100x better than this hunk of junk.,0
"**Update: this launcher has multiple settings, if you pull the launching mechanism handle all the way back to the ""10"" setting, and aim the launcher slightly up, a standard tennis ball is capable of going 30-40 feet out! If you thrust as you pull the trigger to launch the ball, you can achieve well over 40 feet of distance. Furthermore, despite being powered by two large rubber bands, this thing is very durable and is still working very well after nearly two months of daily use.**

I agree with other reviewers that this ball launcher doesn't really shoot the ball very far and it's somewhat overpriced, but it's still a lot of fun.

My 1 year 10 months old Labrador, Moby, loves this thing. Possibly due to his ""gun dog"" instincts or (more likely) just the fact that it's awesome to have a ball shoot out of a strange contraption. His retrieving percentage goes up from 50 to 99.999% with this!

This launcher is extremely easy to use. You pull back the launching handle and slide a ball inside the front opening. Pull the trigger and out goes the ball about 20 feet out.

I also tried this launcher with a Chuckit Ultra ball. Since it's heavier than a regular tennis ball, it barely went 15 feet. So the obvious question is if most people can throw or even toss a ball more than 20 feet out and with a plastic/flinging ball launcher even farther, why would anyone want a gun that costs a lot more and launches the ball shorter? This is currently the only launcher of its type. There are ""attachments"" for potato guns that work well but they require another gun and cost more in the long run if you don't have one already. And this gun is pretty well built. My dog has bitten it a few times and I've dropped it from five feet high a few times onto hard wood flooring. It's held up pretty well. Even with the dirt and sand constantly going into it (I shake and tap it out while pointing it down), it's still working great.

Given how excited Moby is when this thing launches a tennis ball, I have to say it was worth every penny for me--and if you know where to buy this thing for less, you could save a pretty penny (or two). Sometimes you find dog toys for less at the weirdest retailers (that carry bed, bath and ""MORE"" stuff)...",1
Not a fan of this. First off it is not very cost effective if you have a large dog as you have to give so much per day. My dog has never been a picky ester but she didn't want to eat her food with the powder mixed in. I did less than the recommended dose and my dog got diarrhea pretty bad. I stopped it and one her stool was normal I restarted at one scoop (my dog is 140lbs) which is west lower than what she needs. After 2 doses the diarrhea came back. So needless to say I won't be using this product again,0
This litter box is awesome! Its spacious inside and well designed. My 2 cats went right in without hesitation. My only issue is that my cats like the door/flap left open. I imagine if you leave the flap closed you get complete odor control. As it is its not bad though and you can only smell the litter if you get close to the box. Overall highly recommended.,1
Dog loves the vest. I just wish it went about 4-5 inches longer down the back.,1
"The collar is sturdy and well made.  However, the buckle is huge and strangely placed on the collar.  I really wanted to like this but couldn't get past the huge clear buckle on the back of my dog's neck.  The buckle looks like it belongs on a collar for a large dog- not a small one.",0
My little yorkie loved her new monkey for about an hour and then the sound quit.  The toy is still fine but without the sound.  I bought it for the sound.,0
Good,1
"i bought this as a second litterbox for my kitty so he could have one upstairs in case he got locked out of the basement. he rarely uses it, and when he does use it, i find that he can barely fit inside, and i have to clean up cat s*** or piss on the outside fairly frequently and off the walls on the inside daily.

large clumps of litter are the only things collected by the screen, and his medium sized turd nuggets get stuck in the screen, not gettign filtered out as promised, and only causing the filter to work even more poorly.

the construction itself is plastic, with cheap clasps holding everything together. this makes dis-assembly for cleaning a breeze, but after having to assemble and dissemble multiple times, the plastic parts don't quite fit together right.",0
"POISON FOR CATS!!! DO NOT USE! If I could give zero stars I would! I put this product on my cats thinking it would be safer because it was supposedly natural. Boy was I wrong! I put it on my cats and within a couple of hours they started acting lethargic and gagging as if choking. I washed the stuff as as soon as possible and I'm praying it doesn't do anymore damage to my cats. Im not usually one to write reviews but I am terrified for my cat after seeing the way they started acting after just a few hours with this stuff on them. I'm not even all that picky about what I put on my cats but I will NEVER put this on them. Don't use this stuff! Shame on you, Sentry!",0
I ordered the wiggly giggly ball for my dog and it don't wiggle or giggle even when he moves it.  It is a waste of money and I wish I could return it.  So don't waste your time or money ordering it. I have a poodle/shitzu mix dog.,0
My dog ripped this within 2 minutes of receiving it.. sad that this toy couldn't even last for more than a day.,0
Great product at a great price and fast free delivery.  Outstanding!,1
squeaker is not protected as soon as dogs teeth bit down on ball it no longer squeaked didn't last,0
"I was feeling hopeful about this product - it looks good - but it is fairly flimsy and I'm sure a big dog could easily take it down. I won't be able to find that out, though, because one part is missing and another is duplicated. Should have read all the reviews first!",0
"My kitty seen to like it, and it is easy to open the bags.",1
"The shampoo does not dispense during shampoo cycle, I have to open the unit and press on the packet.  That works of course,  but it does not work as the directions indicate or as described.  It turned out to be just a pricey hose.",0
I just received my exercise ball and of course it's missing the lid to close it. Very unhappy customer!,0
Does not work!  It's a waste of money and time.  I used it regularly (daily)  as the directions stated.  It might work if there is no staining to keep face clean but it does not work to remove stains.  I am using it as a dog shampoo now just use it it up.  I gave up on it cleaning my dogs face with this product.,0
This is exactly what I needed to keep my dog from jumping into the back seat. Easy to install. Easy to adjust. Sturdy but not to heavy.,1
The seal on the bottle was open and fluid was leaking everywhere. Yuck and barely any left.,0
I love this product! It is really easy to use and it doesn't bother my dogs ears at all. I find that it clears up his ears really well so long as I don't let the yeast infection get too bad. I also love that I don't have to clean his ears while using this product.,1
"Buy these if you like to feed your dogs garbage, nothing but flour and water here.",0
Used it twice then the seams started to rip. I set out to find another backpack and I found Ruffwear it more expensive but it holds up.,0
I don't even know where to start... Ok first of all I purchased this item on 1/31 and paid extra for the 2 day shipping it wasn't until I confirmed the purchase that it told me the estimated arrival date was 2/8 which is clearly not 2 days then I kept an eye on it and it showed not shipped until 2/7 and I still didn't even receive it until 2/9 mind you it was in stock. Then to top it all off it fits length wise but is way to big around the neck it keeps falling off I put a few stitches in the chest but it doesn't look like to worked and then I put it in a garment and washed it and the seam to one of the arms came apart so I had to fix that too. You get what you pay for...,0
"My baby mouse loves this house!! He took to it right away... Running through it, hiding in it, sleeping in it... It's a great little house for my baby mouse. The only complaint I have is that it's a bit on the small side and my baby mouse (3 weeks) barely fits in it. In just another couple weeks I'm afraid he won't fit in it any more. But overall, great product.",1
awesone bed my dogs love it !,1
"A good price. We bought a few- like 3 and put them together.. it is huge. Big enough for two people to sit in and play with the hamster. She is fast and a dwarf and hasn't wiggled out yet, but we haven't left her in there to long unsupervised.",1
"This is probably worthy of 5 stars, but my vet said, ""Don't use it--you could crack or damage a tooth,"" as I am just an owner.  So I can't use it and you shouldn't unless you are trained in scraping dogs' teeth.",1
A good product !,1
It's just oil.  So it's okay.,1
"tr&egrave;s r&eacute;sistantes aux crocs des chiens, je les ai surnomm&eacute;es les balles magiques.",1
Its great way better than the water resistant cases that are way to bulky for cats. This picture doesnt give thos product justice. Your buying a small strechy cloth sleeve that you slip the locator into and then route the collar through. You're not buying the ugly collar in the picture.,1
my dog shredded the ball the first day.,0
"OEM product, best price I've found is here at Amazon",1
save your money.. do not buy!!,0
Convenient,1
This harness run small and I could not use it on my dog.  On the original site I did not see any reference to the inches of the girth it would fit to decide on what size to order so i took a chance on a med. and it was too small.  My dog weights about 21-23 lbs so I figured that would be a med. not a large....wrong.  I had to ship it back.,0
"My fiance came saddled with a number of cats and keeping them out of the toilet and off the counters and sinks has been a chore. This bad boy keeps 'em watered and out of the sink. Now if i can only get hem to stop taking the cotton swabs.

Updating this as I ordered a second one after 4 cats and a large dog killed the first. Completely understandable, it just couldn't keep up with the animals so no issues there. However, I bought a new one after we lost a few of our furry friends thinking the lighter load would be better on it. The new unit leaks from the motor constantly. I at first thought it was the dog as he slobbers a bit when drinking but then noticed the carpet was soaked all the way around the unit. Im going to write this off as a learning experience and I will be avoiding this company and its products for the foreseeable future.",0
"Please be aware that the pump has a lever on the side to control the water pressure.  Nothing in the description, instructions or pictures explains this.  I thought the pump was defective.  I requested a ""replacement"" from Amazon.  However, since this particular one was ""fulfilled"" by Amazon and not ""sold"" by Amazon, they would only refund your money after returning the item.  Amazon does sell this item, but not the particular one I got.  Had Amazon ""sold"" mine, they would have replaced it.  I spent about three hours researching the fountain and reading reviews.  The pump is sometimes an issue.  I learned about the maintenance and ordering a pump replacement, which would almost cost as much as the waterer including the shipping.  The website with the pump ""replacement"" has a picture that shows a ""lever"" on the side.  That solved my problem.  In the future I will also be apprehensive when I purchase an item that is fulfilled by Amazon but ""sold"" by others.",0
Cats love it.,1
great,1
Love that this smells great on my dogs coat for days. Very fragrant!,1
"Yes they did, It was a blast to watch him with this toy not sharing with the others. For the whole 10 minutes before he bit a hole in it let the air out and stopped the noise......
It was almost worth it anyways..almost....",0
The batteries need to be replaced monthly.,0
"Very well-made, true to size.  Small fits my 6.8lb chihuahua perfectly - easy on/easy off.  I also ordered a medium - fits loosely, great for over a sweater.",1
Does a good job. I did add a small rake. Sometimes them turds just don't want to cooperate. Really like it.,1
"The picture makes it look like an average cat has plenty of room in, and would be cozy for a larger cat. It's much smaller than it looks, and it's the next to largest size of their cat beds.  So if you have a smaller cat, it would be OK, it seems well constructed and the pad inside is removable, with a no-skid bottom to the exterior. But when it's too small for a cat to fit inside, it's useless.",0

"I was looking to replace the worn corner feeders in my slant trailer.  I purchased this model for the adjustable straps which I hoped would help me to hang this feeder slightly lower than the other models available, allowing my horses to put their heads down slightly to eat while hauling.  The construction is good, and I like the strap features-- but the bag itself is really oddly sized.  All three sides are a different length and I've tried rotating it through all the options, but none are quite right for my trailer (which is not unusually shaped!).  The feeder is too tight on one side and droopy on the other two.  I'd send it back if I hadn't already gotten it dirty.  I'm looking elsewhere for replacements.",0
Didn't work.,0
Great with bed. Easy to wash and vacuum,1
Nice firm ball for my mixed pit bull terrier. He loves chasing it and so far its still on one piece!!,1
Just got this today and it was super easy to assemble and my puppy is already starting to use it. Will need some training to use it but already thinking about buying another.,1
Best muzzle out there that allows your dog to drink and eat!,1
"Perfect! My betta loves it. I think he may also use it as a bubble nest - if so, I'll use a betta hammock to feed him on. And, interestingly, because the link to the ring is solid plastic on a hinge, I may try rotating it and see it it works as a swim through ring. :)",1
"My macaw, cockatoo, and blue front Amazon loves this food!  That's why I've been buying this over and over again!!",1
VERY flimsy,0
"4 month old kitten NEVER plays with it
it's a very bulky. ugly thing to leave sitting there
to never get played with...will be donating it to the local cat shelter",0
"Did not capture our dog's attention as much as I had hoped.  But, I had seen an older blind dog with one of the balls and it had given that dog a new lease on life.  She lost weight and was in better shape than she had been for a long time.  Meggie looked for that ball as soon as she got up in the morning.  The ball was more important than a doggie chew stick.  She absolutely LOVED that ball!  So, for our dog it was quite a different situation.  The ball is a wonderful idea for a blind dog!
There are probably a ton of dogs out there with vision disabilities  You should get a video of our friend's dog playing with one of those balls....you would have those balls flying off the shelves!  If I had a dog with that kind of problem, I'd buy enough balls to last their lifetime!  I'm not exaggerating at all!  (If interested...contact me and I'll give you their email address.)",1
One fussy cat that likes this well enough to get a crushed pill into her!,1
I absolutely LOVE this litter. If you scoop every day the litter lasts a full month I have three cats that have access to four boxes,1
"I'd give this thing 6 stars if I could.  Our stupid cats love it.  Easy to assemble (although it takes a while) and affordable...perfect.  I was concerned about it being so tall and tipping over, especially if our big fat pig cat got on top, but it's pretty stable.  It's a little wiggly when they are on the top shelves and play fighting with each other, and it took them a little while to get used to that.  But after a couple of days they were fine with it and sleep up on top all of the time.

Make sure you get the tube things screwed in super tight, especially at the bottom as you can do no further tightening once you add on another level.",1
good deal,1
Again poor quality control wing off in 5 minutes not even double stitched or better still overlocked just single row of stitching need to rectify this problem especially at price charged,0
It doesn't work at all.  I sprayed it on a flea and it didn't kill it.  It did make one of my 4 cats foam at the mouth.  I really hoped it would of worked.  My cats are indoor cats and some how we brought fleas in hoping I can get rid of them without bombing the house!!,0
This is a nice little item.  It doesn't look too tacky hanging on your door knob.  Don't make the mistake I did and take your puppies paw and hit at the bells too enthusiastically.  I did....and frightened the puppy.  Jingle the bell yourself for the first few times and then very gently start letting the puppy start touching the bell....and eventually the puppy will catch on.,1
It did not work at all. Dog actually licked it off of the furniture.,0
Cats are crazy for this,1
"I would NOT buy this again at this price.  I feel that it is too thin and worth about $10. For the price I paid (about 23), I would have been much better off going to Sam's Club and purchasing one of their $25 ones.  I ended up putting old dog beds UNDER this one to make it thick/warm enough.",0
Never liked the smell. A matter of taste i guess,0
This is our 4th harness like this for our newest addition. Fits great and got to us quickly. I have nothing negative to say about the seller. Great experience!!,1
dog loves it,1
"The instructions aren't very clear but we used the picture on the box and figured it out easily enough. Very sturdy and soft material, but the design is flawed with one corner sticking out in a weird way in the back. But it works well enough where we want the tower so 4 stars.",1
"it constantly comes undone, the batteries don't keep a charge longer than a week",0
"Updated review: can't hear the bells. Disappointed since I was optimistic. So far, so good. Like the larger bells.",0
My dog threw up,0
I like it.  Very easy to keep clean.  The spilled food rinses right off.,1
Didn't fit well in my car and the holes for the seat belts defeat the purpose of keeping wet dog and dirt off your seats,0
I have two cats that need this product. One takes it easily sprinkled on food. The other hates it and the capsules are so large she can't swallow it without choking even if I syringe water after. Wish it came in a liquid,1
Caps did fit properly. I bought the smallest they were still big for my cat nails,0
"Doesn't choke my dog when he pulls on the leash, which is every time we walk, my dog loves it and so do I",1
The small dog shoes are sooo cute can't wait to take my dog to the park. I thank the Amazon costumer service team for All there help in getting the right size,1
"The item was delivered quickly, and was fairly easy to assemble alone (though MANY pieces were involved and had to be laid out all around my living room), and it was great for about the first week. I like to move the cage outdoors during the day (thus, the reason for the casters), however, after about 10 days of use (and not really wheeling it that far from points A to B), the bottom metal structure is now rickety and about to collapse. I now have to find some other kind of shelving using or rolling cart to place this structure on top of, or it is getting ready to fall over at any minute. Right now, I have it propped up against a wall and a bench, keeping it outdoors. If I slightly move it to change out water or replace food, I have to grip it and hold it ""up"" with both hands so it won't topple over. Not good quality at all. If the bottom half was more sturdy - perhaps had stronger, thicker metal legs - this would be a great product. Also - the shelf, or lip that is supposed to hold up the bottom plastic tray is useless; the tray always fall off.",0
It was what I expected,1
"I loved how this worked and I am pretty sure Samantha loved it too. Samantha was a stray that lived outdoors last winter but indoors now. It got down to 5 degrees and she would come out of her house stretching and yawning, then when she realized how cold it was she go back inside.",1

Its the cutest blanket for my grey tabby cat. I can bundle her up in her carrier or snuggle wiith me.,1
This product produced seizure on my BC. Applied 3x and my thought is that this product has lingering effects in the dogs blood stream. Use with caution.,0
My 3 dogs LOVE these.  The box has tons of treats and lasts a long time.  Amazon is the same price as local stores plus delivers for free with Prime.,1
This stuff did nothing to whiten!,0
my dog loves it!,1
"Poorly made, cost half of what I paid for the item to send it back.  Don't waste your money",0
"We live in New England and the winters here get pretty dry. Every year around January, the dogs coats start to get dull and their skin gets flaky. We started supplementing their food with Grizzly Salmon Oil and noticed an immediate difference. For one thing, there was a lot more drool when they realized they were going to get nice, smelly food! For another, their coats were shiny and soft and their skin seemed to even out. It took a little bit of finesse to get used to the pump. I overshot the dog bowls a few times. However, I definitely appreciate the convenience of the pump. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their dogs to have healthy skin and coats.",1
"It was awful, my dog didn't like it at all",0
"Unfortunately, in order for my dog to wear this I have to twist the ends to get it to clip correctly.  The ends were sewn on backwards.  It still works but it is quite a pain to get on.",0
Fine,0

"This is a really good idea, but the out come wasn't great.  We have 2 dogs; one tolerated it just fine, but the 2nd got stomach issues and reflux from it.  As soon as we discontinued all was good.",0
Absolutely love this bowl!! Works well with all kibble sizes and really helps my dog pace himself when eating,1
"Discrimination of this item is all wrong. The material is cheap, and the picture is not at all what the product looks like. So disappointed and its useless to me.",0
Leaks,0
Helps keep the itch down. Great smell. Very shiny coat!,1
Cleans cats. Makes them smell nice.,1
"I found this machine to be ineffective.  It both gave my cat more food than I had scheduled for and allowed for her to ""steal"" much more.  My 8 pound cat weighed in at 12 pounds after 6 months on this feeder.  I am dispensing her food now and she has lost most of the weight.  Good product idea, bad execution.",0
Awsome scraper. Beats trying to scrub your tank with a pad. This literally will remove calcium deposit and coraline algae.,1
This stuff really helps and gave my dog quick relief.  Just use as directed for all days!,1
Same thing happened to me as previous poster. The nectar spilled EVERYWHERE! A huge mess and waste of time. DO NOT BUY. Shame on this company.,0
Bought two of these. They immediately started falling apart. Half the size they were because all top areas broke off. Don't order.,0
Pissed! It takes an act of God to get stuff on my cats. Just to find that every single tube on the second round was EMPTY!!! That is a LOT of money to be out.. of course they won't give my money back because the of time frame. Well how are you to know that until you go to use them. OMG never again!!!,0
Great quality and worth every penny.,1
"Our dog likes to chew bones, however, she didn't even try to bite this one. I managed to get her to take it from my hand, but she dropped it immediately and never gave it a second sniff. I gave it the smell test myself and could not catch even a hint of bacon. Sorry, this one's a dud for our pups.",0
Dogs kind of liked it but you have to make sure you totally close the bag or your house will smell like fish.,0
"My pup had a gorgeous soft coat before I used this on her. I'm really disappointed... her undercoat is now short little hairs, as if I shaved her, and she has long scraggly hairs on top and the hair is rough to the touch... just like when a hairdresser uses a razor on your hair to give that layered look. I'm bummed, I should've spent the money on the more expensive version that doesn't cut.",0
Ordered the medium hedgehog and received the same three hedgehogs in a trunk that other reviewers did. No returns and my dog has no interest in pulling the hedgehogs out.,0
Perfect for my jack Russel.,1
They are too short and very flimsy....i have to use standard trash bags for my top loading litter box.  I used to be able to buy the liners at Petsmart that worked but they do not carry them anymore either.,0
Bone became very sharp from biting and my dog ended up biting pieces off. I took it away and threw it out because of these reasons,0
I have two PWD's that need frequent baths.  I bought the pump and love being able to get my soap one handed.  Pups are soft and smell great!  I recommend!,1
"Should have purchased this a long time ago, love it! Took my dog one day to figure it out.",1
Didn't hold up as well as I thought. Dog chews through a corner of it in no time and he doesn't normally chew.,0
"This has nothing to do with the food, the food is great!  However, make sure the food you receive is ACTUALLY Thera A!  The stuff that was sent to me was just the regular stuff with a sticker over the UPC saying it was Thera A.  Double check your product!",0
"They fit securely on the regular large size cans of cat food.  The ones I had previously purchased at Walmart tore apart after only a month.  These, however, are much more sturdy.  No problems so far.",1
"UPDATE:  I switched the box out at 29 days when the litter started to pool.

So, here's the math.  I paid about $82 (inc. tax) for 6 refills on the payment plan.  That's roughly $13.66 for every 29 days, or $.47/day.

I did stir the litter thoroughly and scoop the poop about twice a week, though sometimes less often.

ScoopFree won't work with a cat that pees a lot, though.  That type of cat would probably need the Litter Robot.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I got the ScoopFree Litter Box because I am presently experiencing some unpleasant and disabling health issues, among them are pain and fatigue, which make squatting down to fish cat waste out of the litter box more of a daily chore than it should be.

I am presently on Day 19 of the included refill, and so far so good.  My cat is only seven pounds, and fastidious.  She immediately recognized what the box was for.  The first time that the rake swept her leavings aside, she was a bit alarmed and spent the rest of the afternoon stalking her box.  But she quickly became bored with it.  It's possible that more timid cats might be hesitant to use the ScoopFree.

After reading the mixed reviews I decided to follow the advice of the instructional literature (and a few of the other customers) and scoop out the waste tray every few days.  Also, as someone who has used crystal litter before, it is important to occasionally stir the litter.  Silica based litter (crystals) works by drawing the liquid out of the cat's urine.  What is left are tiny little flakes of pee waste.  Stirring brings the unsaturated crystals in from the edges, extending the life of the litter.  My only criticism so far with the ScoopFree is that the rake is insufficient to properly stir the litter.  In the past, one box of silica litter has lasted 25-30 before becoming saturated and I see no reason why the ScoopFree should not if hand stirred occasionally.

I will attend to the box (stirring, and removing waste) every 4-5 days.  That is fine with me, a huge improvement over the daily burden, and worth the $20/month refill maintenance cost.  I will update my review when I determine how long the refill lasts.",1
"While I paid less than $5 for this toy, I figured it would last longer than 1 day given that it was Kong brand. Our dog is a retriever/hound mix and comes in at just under 40 lbs, so he is by no means an exceptionally aggressive biter. After about an hour of play last night after receiving it in the mail, and leaving him to play with it this afternoon, the side is ripping off, something is now broken and rattling inside, and it no longer squeaks. I'm only giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because he really loves it, despite all it's flaws. I'd recommend skipping this one, or buying in bulk knowing it won't last through the night.",0
The gears are made of the same cheap soft plastic as the outer shell.  The unit won't last over 6 months.,0
"Arrived quickly,before scheduled delivery. Very happy w/purchase. Was just as listed & had quick/easy comminuncation w/seller. Will be ordering again soon ! Thanks again TZ
.",1
Puppies love them and fast delivery,1
Best dog toy ever!  It works great and regular size tennis balls fit in as well.,1
"I purchased this litter box from a major online pet supply retailer. The box itself is large, I wouldn't call it jumbo but it's definitely larger than a standard size litter box. The plastic is rigid though, not incredibly thick but will seemingly suffice. The top filter is largely useless, a marketing gimmick if nothing else. The locks that secure the top to the bottom have worked thus far but they certainly don't impart a sense of reliability. The carrying handle on top is nice and serves its purpose. The partially folding top is flimsy though it does make a quick cleaning somewhat easier.

My problem is with the door assembly, the fact that it doesn't work. Like several other reviewers have stated, the door on my unit does not swing freely. The plastic is warped and far too flexible to keep the door hanging perfectly vertical. The door rubs one side of the door frame rendering the entire door and concept, useless. I contacted Hagen customer service to let them know about the door and their response was simply, ""Sorry, we advise you to return it to the place of purchase"". Needless to say, I will not be purchasing Hagen products in the future.",0
"it was easy to set up, good quality. I only gave 4 star because I wish it had came with a cover",1
"Ummm.... This thing is freaking magical.  Did PetSafe weave Xanax into its fibers?  I have a 5 mo old pitty boy whom I recently adopted. He had little to no obedience training or structure in his previous home.  He weighs just 33 lbs but he is strong!! He has strong terrier instincts. For those of you who are familiar with owning and training any breed of terrier you understand how their high prey drive can become a challenge when it comes to training....especially in the presence of the many distractions that are in their environments.  It's difficult enough to hold their focus inside with minimal distractions, let alone outside.

I ordered a medium and I would be surprised if we had to move to a large later on. At first I thought it was too big for him, but once I got it adjusted it fits him nicely. I hooked his leash up and we went for a potty break.  He immediately lunged forward as he'd done every time before. But unlike before, he stopped and waited for me. And he and I walked side by side the entire potty break. I thought it might have been my superb training skills....so I asked my husband to walk him around a bit, who hasn't spent as much time training him.  My little boy was a perfect gentleman.  I'm sold.

And... I'm ashamed to admit, his pulling was such a problem that I even resorted to using a prong collar, twice.... Which, not surprisingly, made his pulling worse. (Obvious he was trying to get as far away from the source of the discomfort as possible- the person tethering him....) Using this harness daily has given my adhd weeman pitty boy a big giant chill pill and has helped the two of us take big steps forward towards our training goals.",1
Didnt work for us. We did not have access all the time to re-wet it.,0
worth the money!!,1
Arrived quickly and the bells are exactly what we wanted.,1
The only thing is the divider should have a dogie door. I cut out one myself.,1
"When this stays up it's great. But it falls randomly even after I cleaned the window. My cat likes it, I just wish it stayed up better.",0
This litter box is so low and small it does nothing to keep sand inside.  Not recommended for animals larger than a gerbil.,0
"We presently have 4 cats and this is our third cat tree.  We all think this cat tree is great, much better than what is available in the chain pet stores.  The primary reasons for our opinion are:
(1) All of our cats love it.  We have had up to three cats in it at one time.  Even the largest one (15 to 16 pounds) gets into the mid-level house and everybody loves the top levels.
(2) The carpet is a low tight, nap and every column is wrapped in sisal.  Cat trees with loose carpet and carpet wrapping on the poles are disasters waiting to happen. If you are lucky your cat just shreds the carpet on the poles, if you are unlucky the cat then eats the carpetCats love scratching posts and every column on this tree is a scratching post.
(3) It is sturdy and stable.  Assembly is easy and every component is bolted into place, so it is sturdy.  They did knock the tree down shortly after we put it up, but they quickly adapted and there have been no further incidents.
We will probably buy another tree from this company or maybe another one of these.",1
This medium will not fit a small mini Dachshund.  I had to return this harness because only came in medium size.  The package was medium but I think it was X-large.  When I tried to exchange for a small...the small was not prime shipping.  Very frustrated.  I love the small harness but it has to fit my small mini dachshund. Hope to get the right size through a full refund and try to get the small.,0
Out of the box the transmitter and receiver do not sync.  I went to the Aetertek website and followed all of the directions provided and it still does not work.  There is no phone number provided on the website.  When I emailed the company to get a phone number they responded three days later with the directions on how to setup the device.  Those directions do not work!  Do not waste your time or money on this device.  TERRIBLE company!,0
I ordered a size large for my lab. They took about 6 weeks to arrive and I was so surprised when I opened the package -- and found a set of shoes that would possibly fit a Chihuahua! The shoes appear fairly well made and I would have really liked to have been able to use them on my dog. I don't even know anyone with a dog small enough to use them. Totally useless! Don't order unless you have a miniature dog.,0
Seems to be more easily digested than other foods we tried.,1
great,1
"Love this carrier - the 2 side expansions really make it comfortable for for my kitten when we take him outside the house, and I'm able to put some toys and food in there for him while we're out. He even loves it so much I leave it open for him at home and its one of his favorite spots to lay. Great buy.",1
"My koi and goldfish LOVE LOVE LOVE this food. When they were little  I fed a small pellet, then for winter I fed floating Spring and Fall pellets and they liked that. So I decided to try this. They prefer the bigger size and just love the taste. You can really tell when you feed something else as well as this feed. They like cheerios but they love this. It also seems very clean with no wasted pellets. This is a very good price on this box of 2 enclosed bags of food. It is packaged very well. This is what I will buy from now on,  and from this vendor.  If my fish are happy, I am very happy!",1
Used this piece of junk ONCE for a min pin's poo (smaallll) and it BROKE!!! Don't waste your money!,0
"I did quite a bit of research and read all available reviews.  I chose this product.  My two 15 lb miniature schnauzers stay in the same cage and enjoyed the comfort this product offered.  HOWEVER, it did not hold up more than two weeks before normal everyday dog play had created two holes in the fabric.  Once created, they removed all of the internal stuffing.  What is most disappointing is that overall my dogs are not chewers, yet I am out the money and am yet again shopping for another dog crate bed.

Bottom line: very comfortable bed, not at all durable.",0
"Works well, we love it!",1
I really wanted this to work but it gave my dog terrible diarrhea diarrhea,0
My two dogs love these and when they finish chewing there is nothing left.,1
"This spray is absolutely magical. It gets fresh urine out of carpets. It gets dried urine out of carpets. We have a puppy and an older dog so there is always somebody having accidents indoors. Even if we find the stain days later, this spray has gotten the stain out. Truly magical.",1
I expected to get at least a day or two out of this toy but Boe tore it up in 10 minutes or less. The 2nd picture is when we first gave it to him and the 1st is 10 minutes later.,0
these are perfect for taller cats that need help keeping it in the box but can't fit in a full covered box,1
"This is a mat, not a bed. And WOW, the beads on the bottom that are supposed to help grip come off in bundles. There are little beads in the crate, and when I washed the rhing, there were beads everywhere.",0
"Easy to adjust the size. Light weight, and easy to use. Very bright orange lights keep our dog safe, when walking in the dark. Would recommend this collar to anyone.",1
"When I hooked up the Aqueon water changer, the siphoning worked great. When it came time to fill the aquarium back up however, I soon discovered that the water pressure was too great for the hose connection on the gravel tube vacuum attachment. This resulted in a 40ft sprint with a running hose in my basement back to the sink. (regardless of how little I opened the tap, the water pressure was just too great for the hose connection - and to be honest, we have poor water pressure in our house.)

I have since contacted Aqeuon who told me to force the hose over the threads on the vacuum attachment, which as far as I have tried, is impossible since the threads are at least 1/2"" more in diameter than the hose itself. At first I thought I had been missing a part, but no. It just isn't designed very well.

If they put a little more effort into the design for the gravel tube, this problem could easily be resolved.  The nut holding the hose on just doesn't have enough grip.  The connection to the sink is very well designed, if they had carried that over to the gravel tube as well, I wouldn't be leaving a one star review.

Since the product doesn't function as advertised straight out of the box, I am returning it today and hoping the Python system is designed better",0
fish love it,1
My cat loves these . The only treats he will eat,1
"I dropped some in my pleco tank, to see what the plecos made of it, and they made a snack of it. it was funny watching all the little juvie plecos kissing up to the pellets. Probably would get a smaller canister in future though. This one will take months to use up.",1
"I've had this for about 30 minutes and it already broke.

1.) The top of the handle is damaged/dented
2.) One of the snaps on the side broke off during installation making it unusable.

I don't drive so returns aren't realistic for me.",0
None of my four boys were in the least bit interested in this catnap... Boooo....,0
Bad quality,0
This is great but so many times I can't get the 2 pound jug.,1
I ordered the 9 x 15 pad but I received some kind of gigantic pad that I didn't order. Returned it. I don't know what happened to the one I ordered & the one referred to above ????,0
Small dog was able to chew open the hole in two hours,0
Cat loves it. Arrived a day late but no biggie.,1
Tried these several times and on a routine basis to get to the back of my small fella's teeth.  We are sticking with our toddler toothbrush and Arm&Hammer tooth paste.,0
"Our smaller dogs were a little hesitant because we got a larger size than their other door, but after training with treats they were fine.  The best part about this was how easy it was to put in.  We are looking forward to a bug and urine free house this summer.",1
Cats still have fleas after giving application 2 weeks ago...,0
Did not last an hour!,0
This is a great kitty bed. Our two Bengals sleep/rest together in it.,1
"I have this little heater. Practical and small. It does work. However,  it warmed my 5 gallon up to 84 before I unplugged it. Now I keep checking the thermometer so I can plug it in for few hours.  I might use it to warm up my fry tank which is about 30 gallons but then the cord won't be enough. Forget about the drip loop unless you have your tank directly next to the outlet.",0
"I use these as a treat for my dogs. They love them. However, if I give them more than 2-3 per day they get severe stomach/bowel problems. I thought it was a fluke. But I noted several people have noted problems with this product when given too frequently. The contents are not great and I have a basic problem with any dog food that is sold at Walmarts at a discount.

So, in small use, it is ok, but clearly is a product with issues. Wheat flour is the number one ingredient. Not a great product.",0
When wet it smells like nail polish remover. When dry it leaves a smell on the item like old lady. This smell will NOT come off with simple soap and water.,0
"This would be good for kittens, not good for full grown cats. My 1 1/2 year old cat stuck her head in the hole at the top and when I got home from work she was waiting for me. I am not sure how long she had been stuck in there but I was glad it happened when I wasn't away for several days.",0
pen does not stay in the shape you want it to. the puppy is able to move the sides of the pen very easily and this is unsafe because the pen can collapse on itself & onto your dog. do not reccomend,0
"I really like the concept of a hay bag with only a small area of netting where the animal can eat. Unfortunately, the netting was chewed through within a few weeks. Great design, but needs stronger netting.",0
"we could not find any pee pee mat that would fit this size holder, strange",0
"Cole, my 110lbs black lab rott mix, loves it!",1
"When I first adopted my dog she was on Iams puppy. She didn't really seem to like it that much. I knew of Wellness food from my fianc. When he first adopted his dog he did a lot of research on dog food and found Wellness to be a good brand. I slowly switched my puppy over from Iams to Wellness and she loves it! I feed her twice a day (7am & 6pm) and when that bowl hits the ground she devours it. Anyone who is house breaking a dog knows that it is so much easier when they eat their found within 10 minutes so you know their poop schedule. When I told her vet that she was on Wellness they also confirmed that this was a good dog food. Also, and I am not sure if this is typical, but when she was on Iams puppy she was pooping about 6 times a day. On wellness she poops about 2 - 3 times  a day.",1
It s ok,1
puperoni broken into many small pieces,0
"Love the crates by MidWest.  Have several.  This particular one was slighly different in thst the door latch was soldered on a bit off so the latch doesn't operate as smoothly as the others.  Also, more irritating to me is that the tray is not smooth.  It has more txture to it than the others and when I clean it with paper towels, the dirt sticks and is harder to clean.  Whereas the other trays are smooth and easy to wipe off.  But I would still buy a MidWest crate for the size and the quality, so I would recommend them.",1
Does not work for my cats. Maybe it will for you.,0
These run small and do not fit my cairn terrier. They go around his waist but the Velcro won't catch. We ended up using them infer some other diapers from petco and petsmart as kind of a washable liner. In that respect they work really well.,0
"Was a bit dubious about the price of this item but after a couple of uses I find I really like it and it's worthwhile.

We own 2 long hair German shepherd dogs that shed year round. We get a full canister of hair per brush/vacuum once a week and it really cuts down on the loose/shed hair rolling around the house.

Only tool to be as effective as this one at grooming was a shedding blade made for use on horses but that left a terrible mess (pile of hair 2 feet in diameter and six inches thick). This tool is great, no mess but very easy quick and effective grooming of the dogs. Glad we bought it.",1
"I purchased this roof because I want the triangle ends of the roof covered.  The roof I purchased from Tractor supply did not cover the ends of the roof but is was a way better built product.  Bottomline, I would not recomment this product.  Better off buying the tractor supply roof or building one out of conduit of you have the skills.  my issues are below.  See attached photos as well.

Issues:
1. There are no fasteners provided to attached this roof to the horizontal top of the dog kennel.
- There should be fasteners provided to connect roof kit to dog keen and there were none provided.

2. There is only one horizontal member provided with the roof system (the apex) and it should contain three horizontal members in total.
- 1 tube for the apex or center of roof at the heighest point (provided)
- 1 horizontal tube for left side of roof (Not Provided)
- 1 horizontal tube for right side of roof (Not Provided)",0
Cooper loved this. How much? It was gone in less than 30 minutes. But he's a puppy and loves chewing anything. He started by chewing the tasty bit off the middle Then he moved onto dissecting the rest of it. It did take some hard work on his part but it disappeared quickly.,1
"Overpriced. Did absolutely nothing for my chihuahua. I bought this in hopes to alleviate her crying as soon as she couldn't see me or find me. Even though I am sure to always let her know when I leave. I put this collar on her. She still cried immediately after I left.

I'll try it on my Yorkie next. she gets very anxious when riding in the car. Maybe it will help her.",0
My chihuahua won't step up on any other potty patch but she immediately got onto the DoggieLawn to inspect it. She has used it once so far (a miracle!) and I'm working on getting her to keep using it. I think I might just need to reapply the pheromone spray that comes with it.,1
I can't believe we found this at such a great deal. I didn't even know they existed other than in pet stores.  My mom has 2 cats and the one is dominant. He takes over and assumes ownership of everything.  Well we gave this to the other can and don't let mr. big boss in it.  The cat loves it and goes in there voluntarily.  We keep the doors closed so that the other cat doesn't get in there and put his scent on it.  It was super easy to put together and is great quality.,1
My cats adore this hammock! There isn't a lot of window sill space on our windows so this was perfect. It easily holds my 20lb cat with no problems. I would suggest that you use rubbing alcohol to clean the surface before placing the suction cups though. I was having issues with them staying for longer then 30 mins until I cleaned with the rubbing alcohol now it had been in place for months!,1
This has actually survived the longest out of all of my dog's stuffed toys.  He's part Shar Pei and part pit.  So he can tear it up when he wants to. He loves this thing and has avoided destroying it so far.  He LOVES shaking it up.,1
My dogs love it.  It looks like a bully stick but it is freeze-dried.  It is a great treat but doesn't last long at all which I expected since it was freeze-dried.  I have purchased 6 or 7 different treats by this brand and my dogs love them.  I love them because they are made in the USA and have very minimal if any additives.,1
"I bought this to spare my houseplants.  In theory, this product is great.  The grass grew pretty quickly, but after several days I noticed long, white roots hanging down in the cat's bowl.  It seemed like the roots and the seed casings from the grass made the water bowl very dirty & I noticed the water flow wasn't as quick as normal.  When I went to change the water filter, it was much dirtier than usual.  I was a little concerned about the cleanliness of the water, so I've stopped using this product.  I will say that our cat is a Maine Coon & they are known to play in their water - so it's possible the cat was pulling on the grass or trying to bat at the seed pod & made a mess of things.  But, if I were still using the product, I'd be checking and changing the filter regularly.",0
"This litter is not at all as advertised.

I have been using the Cat's Pride Fresh And Light fragrance-free but was looking for a clumping litter with lower dust.  Ever Clean advertised as 99.9% dust free.

When I poured the litter into the box, a massive dust cloud filled the whole room, and I noticed as well that the litter had a pungent perfume.

At a cost of about 50% more per use than Cat's Pride, I'm going to stick with that brand, whose low dust I now truly appreciate and whose odor control is the best I've found.",0
Best food ever!,1
"What a JOKE. While it works fine, it lasted approximately 12 sprays. I paid over $10 for this can. That is INSANE.",0
"Didn't work all that well for deshedding, but at least the dog loved how it felt on their back! I guess I will use it as a back scratcher for the pets instead lol.",1
"pleasant scent, not as long lasting as previous bottle purchased years prior,  but very nice.",1
"Do not buy these!!! Any other model of this toy is fine, but my dog can get this one apart in minutes. This is the second time I bought this one thinking maybe it was just a manufacturing issue the first time. My dog has chewed on the center part and choked on the bristles. And torn the rubber pieces to shreds. She's only a 60lb lab/beagle mix. Love all of the other variations of this they make, just not this one.",0
Bought this carrier to use on a family trip.  We flew Southwest and it fit under the middle seat perfectly on both flights.  The carrier is roomy enough for my 11 lb. dog to be comfortable when sitting (with the carrier standing up) or laying (both standing and when the carrier is laid flat).  It made the trip a breeze!  I'm glad I went with the medium size - she would have been crowded in the small.,1
Chews getting thinner and smaller. It seems like they are trying to make more money by reducing the size and thickness of the chews. Used to be much thicker and bigger taking my dog some time to chew them up.  But now they are gone in seconds.,0
"It works for what it is but without a lot more balls or the add-on tubing my ferrets get bored with it fast.  When I added the 15 foot tubing and put the ends through the two openings of the pit my ferrets had more fun.  I also made the mistake of buying the add-on balls and there still weren't enough to cover one ferret.

For less money you could buy a small pop up hamper, a large pack of generic kids play balls and have the same thing with more balls for the ferrets to play in.",0
"I have 2 senior dogs 15 and 9 years old. I am very careful about what they get with so much junk out there. This has only 2 ingredients! My 15 year old I rescued as a puppy and I have done my best to give him a healthy diet all these years. He is still running and playing and no one believes his age! My 9 year old I recently rescued and he needs some physical rehabilitation - attributed to his previous poor diet. Yeast and dermatitis along with 11 fatty tumors removed, this guy is recovering and will only get the best! Here he is post op in his cone enjoying his Sally Snacks!",1
A friend had recommend this product to me and my cat. He would wolf down food and admittedly vomit it up. I tried feeding him less food and there wasn't much of a difference. Then my friend told me about slow feeder bowls; I thought it wasn't gonna work. But it took about two days for my cat to adjust to using it and ever since he's been alright with eating.,1
"Cat played with it for less than 10 minutes and had it torn apart, pulled the center green past out, broke off the tabs that hold it in by pulling it off somehow.  Ball can now be taken out of the ring, not really worth it",0
"My 12 year-old daughter and her friend had assembled the cat condo.  It looks nice but unfortunately, my cat, Fluffy, doesn't like it that much comparing to the old condo from another brand so I give it 2 stars.  Fluffy is a very timid three-year-old cat.  She would not jump straight into the box from the ground.  I wish the position of the opening of the box was on the side and front, not front and back from the current design.  If it was opened through the side, Fluffy might feel more comfortable entering the box through the side opening from the mid layer.  I tried to push her into the box but it still didn't work.  Now, I only put cat food on top of the box so she would climb up there from the mid layer.  Otherwise, she only uses the pole to scratch. I am 5'5"" and the highest level of the height of the condo is landed on my shoulder level which is ok.
I think Fluffy would like it better if the resting panel had the edge/broader so she would feel safer when she curbs up and sleep.  The old cat condo was taller and had a rim around all the resting areas, the opening positions of the cave were front and side so cats could enter from the resting panel so the cat didn't have to jump straight up to box from ground like this one.
Maybe, she will get used to this new condo.  She loved The old condo from another brand but the plush material was attached permanently and got dirty quickly with fur.
Pros of this item:  plush material is removable, good scratching material of the poles
Cons for this item:  lack of boarder to the resting panels, lack of side opening of the hiding box",0
"I was unable to push Critical Care at the recommended thickness through the tube.  Also, the tips are dangerously  thin and breakable.  My sick pet simply bit off the end and it lodged in his throat. Cut off the ends before using.",0
Was fun while it lasted! Only a few hour worth of play before it was destroyed,0
I am using it for my cat and dog . Very fast service and easy to put together. Love it.,1

"I'm a 30 y/o Aquarium expert, I got 4 of these for my new planted aquarium. As i was looking for a lake/river bottom look for my new tropical aquarium I love the results with these woods. Just put it under water a couple of weeks before using it and do some water changes to help the wood to clean well, otherwise could turn the water a little yellowish. But beautiful woods",1
"Terrible product. SO tight that as soon as I put this on my dog, her breathing was compromised as it's so incredibly tight around the throat. I didn't want to click any stars but in order to submit a comment I had to click one star. There isn't any Velcro or any other way to loosen it. It just is was it is...a very VERY tight band. I don't recommend this item",0
"Dodie did very well thru the 4th of July. Now if she hears a bang or thunder, she comes over to me to have her shirt put on, then climbs onto the couch. She is very comforted by this product.",1
"I wasn't sure if my dogs actually had worms, I was told all dogs usually do, so I gave them this just in case. It didn't make them sick, but I saw no evidence of worms being expelled either. That doesn't mean it didn't work. I could have missed them, or they could have not had any worms.

This wormer has the same ingredients as the wormer you get from the vet, so I'm sure it works well, or the vet wouldn't use it.
I would buy it again if needed. It's certainly cheaper than going to the vet and having to pay the vet bill plus a higher cost for the same meds.",1
"Works great,just a little overpriced on amazon.",0
These get the job done. I have two big dogs that decided to start using the couch. I found these and haven't had a problem since. The only con is if you forget about them and sit on them while they're on.,1
"Do not but this collar.  My dog wore this collar for about 6 months with no problems or issues.  Some how it malfunctioned and leaked battery acid all over my dogs neck causing severe chemical burns.  He has a long road to recovery and had to have a lazer treatment done with a second to follow.  For the love of your dog, do not buy this!",0
"My cat is still getting used to it. He scratched it once, then left it alone. Working on getting it secured to the window sill, so he'll be encouraged to use it. I will update the review when something happens.",0
Great hooves!  Our dogs are monster chewers and these have held up well.  On par with other hooves we've bought before.,1
"We ordered these because we had two larger ones that have lasted for years and had finally come to the end of their lives.  Boy did we screw up with this order, the zippers broke on one of them the first night, the zipper on the second one, lasted a couple more nights... I am not bothering to return them as we had to get something locally for our little dogs.",0
"I have a black cat, and she looks ABSOLUTELY GLAMOROUS!!!!!!! in this collar!!!!!!!",1
Amazing high quality collar. And it is real leather. Nice and thick. Great seller too. Order came fast! Wish it came in pink for girl dog,1
This is a wire with a small cardboard piece.  It is a hard toy and my cat does not like it.,0
"We used a ""no pull"" harness previously and had a lot of leash pulling issues. my dog hated wearing it and it was a struggle to get on and off.  There's been a huge difference overnight with this collar, and he actually seems to be much more comfortable in it.",1
Super small.! Waste of money,0
No glow at all and they can created a tangled mess in water tank if placed close to each other.,0
"Great concept but a horrible idea after putting it into practice. It's impossible to get a bag in place without the cats kicking it up as they enter the unit. End result is that I'm stuck cleaning urine/feces that slips down between the edge of the unit and bag. I then tried no bag which made it a nightmare to clean. Bottom line, just buy a traditional box and put a cat litter mat in front of it.",0
item is as described- works good and we made.,1
It took dog about 1 min to chew out the anemic squeak.,0
"The size of these treats are so small that you could use for a small rodent not dogs. They use to be larger,

Would not recommend,",0
My dog chewed through it in less than a month,0
"This is a small toy, roughly the size of a pot holder.  The body of the toy is made of faux suede.  I'm not 100% sure what faux suede is actually made of... it seems sturdy enough and contains a squeeker.

The issue with this toy on any dog that doesn't treat their toys as a baby doll - is the mane and tail. They are made of a type of rope that freys, shreds and could cause ingestion issues.  If the mane and tail had also been made of faux suede this might have been a 4 star toy - but as it is, the rope fraying within 5 minutes of handing this to my dogs is concerning enough for me to take it away.

This is made in china so if you have an issue with that - be aware.",0
These are great...at giving your dog diarrhea...30 minutes after eating one my poor dog was leaving chocolate sundaes on our yard beware,0
Wonderful Product,1
"This cover has a zipper on it and it's broke already from the dogs stepping on it,  and one of the straps broke also and I have only had it for 2 months and I have 2 puppies that are less then 30 lbs",0
love it.,1
Great item,1
"Super cute, but was not true to size... way too big, had to send it back.",0
Poor fast so the hole tube gets filled with water and wake sure not to disturb the bottom too much.  This tank is the perfect size this tank could actually can be smaller than it is.,1
"Not nearly chew proof, my boxer had it in shreds overnight. A real disappointment.",0
"Don't waste your money.  Bought this for our kitten and although the idea is great, the execution not so much.  First, the quality is ""fair"", it just looks and feel cheap.  The tension or support wires are just that, wires and they are not the same length.  We followed the directions for putting it up, cleaned the glass with the alcohol pads, put the base up first and then attaching the wires/suction cups.  It doesn't even stay attached for 24 hours.  If our kitten (who weights 5 lbs) gets on it, one of the suction cups on the hammock slips and it collapses.  We will figure out how to make our own and trash this one.",0
Very well made vest.  Exactly as I expected.,1
"I like the bowl but it's not as pretty as the red one.  It does not look purple at all, I say the color is more of a flat black.  The red one has a gloss and because of the gloss is easier to clean.  The ""purple"" one has gloss but only on the gold areas.",1
Cute as a button.  Love it.,1
No chew!!,1
"Sinks to the bottom and stays in place, no suction cup to wear out.",1
"So far so good.. Received today, keeping them on so far. Good fit on a GSD. Newly diagnosed eye disease exacerbated by UV light so these are a god send!",1
Lasted all of 5 minutes for my 15 pound border terrier. Chewed a hole right through to the tennis ball on top. Now I'm afraid he'll ingest threads that will get caught in his intestines.,0
Works great!,1
"This is my third shock training collar and I paid four times the amount 15 years ago.  This collar does everything I need it to do, which is to train a dog to know it's boundaries and keep it safe from traffic. My mom's dog was so bad to run off, she had to keep it tied when she was out in the yard.  The vibration button works great.  I've only used the shock button once on her dog and now she stays wherever we are.  This is a great collar for the money!",1
"Great for the money.  My dog is a German Shepherd and goes through bones like none other, he especially loves bully sticks.  I've tried quite a few brands and so far these are the best for the money spent.",1
"Garbage. They bake the moisture and the nutrients out of the meat, then fill it (they don't tell you in the product description) with artificial ""nutrients"". The product that is ""only"" meat, has an ingredient list longer than some candy bars.",0
This stuff is great. We saw immediate results and after a week of treatment as recommended there hasn't been any reoccurrence.,1
It's the best for my pitbull. I will be buying again,1
"Would give it zero, but Amazon won't let me.  I bought this harness/leash for my Gargoyle, Alexander. I bought the large, but it won't even get over his head. This was a dissapointing purchase and a waste of money. I'm in the process of requesting a refund now.",0
My rat loves it.,1
"Sorry, it might be healthy but my dog didn't like it at all
I had to mix wet food with it for him to barely touch it.",0
This crap shock collar lasted 3 days before the hardware inside became loose and no longer works. Wasted $40 on 2 and now I have to search for another.,0
Doesn't heat up. Bought this for my arthritic Corgy and cant even feel it generating heat. A shame because it gets cold here,0
"it ALWAYS fell off my dogs feet. It is not easy to put on and my dog looked uncomfortable. It was too late for me to return, would not recommend",0
"So disappointed.  This dog bed is so nice, very cushy and attractive.  Unfortunately within just a few days a very small hole began to develop right in the center of the bed that is growing larger each day.  I'll try to sew a few stitches, or maybe try to glue the hole closed.  But this bed cost way too much to be slowly coming apart.",0
Guiness and rabbits should have hay 24/7. Not 10.percent of diet. That is totally inaccurate.,0
my cat absolutely loves this thing. he gets good exercise climbing this thing from the bottom to the top. he sleeps at the very top all the time.,1
"The price and size were right. The bottom of the box is slick and it makes it easy to shovel.  My one criticism is that the bottom of the box is not completely square so the corners, even with the small shovel, are difficult to clean. I did have one cat who managed to urinate over the top of the box, but that only happened once in the month I've had the boxes.",1
"DO NOT BUY THESE!!

After I worked a few months at a pet store, I learned quickly that feeding your dog all natural food is truly better for their bodies, inside and out. I am a bit more lenient on treats, so when my mom bought Busy Bones, I figured why not. My dog ate a whole one within an hour, as she is a big chewer, and she's been sick ever since! She woke me up all throughout the night to go out and poop, and she keeps throwing up. Never again will I buy these for mine or anyone else's dog!! She doesn't want to eat or play, she feels absolutely horrible. If anything happens to my dog, I will be going after Purina to pay my vet bill.",0
"Have used these since my Yorkie was just a pup.  Used them originally as a treat for ""potty"" training.  He knew if he went outside to potty he got a treat.  Almost two years later, he still expects (and gets) a treat for going outside. (Yes, every time. And yes, he is very spoiled.)  I always keep a spare bag in the cabinet.  He loves them and best of all they are made in the USA.  I will not purchase any food or treats made outside the U.S., especially China.",1
So far so good. Fish like it!,1
Dogs love them!!,1
"the product look nice however it was too small for my dog ( xxl for rottie girl , she not even that big, 85 lbs)",0
Good product but be careful.  It seemed to alleviate or even cure my dog's skin irritations in some spots.  But it can also cause temporary irritation in some spot that turned red.  Also the dog likes to lick it off.  Give it a try and monitor the result.  It may be a miracle cure for your dog or you may not like it.,1
Cat loves it!,1
This worked great for traveling long distance. Provides lots of air flow and allowed our little Doxie to see everything going on. The only drawback was the slick floor. The pad that comes will it kept sliding around so I cut a yoga mat to fit the bottom for traction.,1
"It's kind of expensive, BUT my cat LOVES it the best. What can you do!? Anything for our little loves. But could you PLEASE get the price down a bit!? Though I must say that you are actually cheaper than Walmart, and with Prime -- no shipping. THANKS!",1
"The guidelines of measurement are totally wrong for ordering this harness. My Maltese is a 9-11"" necksize and this harness can't fit.",0
Ordered mediums for my pugs- and they shipped me out XXS shoes that would fit maybe a doll...not happy at all/,0
"This is an exact match to my Therapure filter, and Therapure wanted 20$ plus shipping. Check the price on this. This product is less pricey, and I can hardly smell smoke in my room anymore (it's the lamp that eliminates smell, not the filter or the apparatus housing it). It works great.",1
"This is the perfect ID for my lad's Service Dog Harness Vest. It is large enough to be highly visible, while being small enough to clip to the ring on the top of the vest. Many people have greeted him by name because of seeing the ID at a quick glance.",1
Smells great. No wet dog smell at all.,1
This was a very bad ideal for a large older cat.  I thing you have to start younger & have LOTS of patience!,0
These work really well for clipping our cat's claws. Quick and easy and effective!,1
"I bought this for my 10 gallon planted tank, where I keep invertebrates, a shoal of danios, and a shoal of neon tetras. This heater is longer than most designed for a 10g tank, and perhaps a little overboard, but it does its job extremely well! I have an external thermometer that I use to model temperature and this heater keeps it very constant. There is a little orange light on the body of the heater that lets you know when the heating element is receiving power, and it can sense when it is not submersed and turn off. The suction cups have had no issues and have stayed on ever since I mounted the thermometer.

Only a couple things I would improve: I wish there was some sort of coil or clip on the power cord to enforce a drip loop - this is a safety feature so water does not drip down the cable into an electric outlet. This has not been a problem, but would be a nice bonus. Also, the setting and calibrating of the temperature is not completely intuitive, and the instructions are not perfectly translated, so make sure you read carefully and monitor this heater (as you hopefully would any aquarium heater) for the first 24h of use.",1
This was larger than the description stated. It was so inaccurate that it wouldnt fit in my tank. I tried to return it but they didn't want it. So I had to give it away and buy a different filter,0
Did not fit as it indicated.,0
This worked great for three months then completely stopped working.,0
"I received a pink one. It is the quality I have learned to expect from Kong. We have some knock offs and they aren't as nice and our dogs honestly prefer the original Kong. I would habe loved the blue version as my dog is a boy, but rhe pink one is cute. And he won't know what color it is. The price on this is wonderful and I would recommend these kongs. The senior Kong is also very nice for larger puppies too.

Update - ordered a second one and got a Blue Kong. Another nice purchase and you just can't beat the price. I will be back for more!",1
My Cat Loki loves this bed. He used to lay on our Heater whenever it turned on. Now he doesn't and just chills on his blanket.,1
My dog just chewed this to pieces!  I haven't even had it for a month and she doesn't even play with it that often.  Why?!  It says it's durable but clearly it's not. It was fun for the few short weeks she had it but I am very disappointed.,0
My dog destroyed the ball in about two weeks.,0
"I purchased one of these collars for my beagle who barks non-stop.  When I put the collar on her the first time, she barked once, got sprayed, and (finally) shut up.  I was in heaven.  I would use it when she went outside in the morning so she didn't wake up the neighbors and occasionally during the day when she was being overly loud.  Three weeks into having the product, I noticed she was barking with it on a lot more.  I checked and it wasn't working.  I assumed the battery was dead and bought a new battery.  Nothing.  Called Premier and they told me to return the unit and they would replace it.  I realized this would mean I'd be without a bark collar for about two weeks, so, I ordered a second unit.

The second unit arrived, sprayed three times, and died.  I attempted to just return it to Amazon, but because there is an aerosol can in the box, they won't accept the return.

So, now I'm stuck with two units, neither of which works, and will have to wait at least two weeks to get a replacement that might or might not work.  Because of this, I can not recommend this product.",0
Runs small,0
"Dog food is great , i made the same mistake as others and didn't notice that it was for six cans for the same price as for twelve cans. Watch out this is twice the price that it is sold in the grocery store!!!",0
"Product changed! Warning! Before you purchase this product, be aware that it has changed to Purely Fancy Feast and has gone from about five ingredients to nearly thirty. Our cats won't touch it. It looks and smells rancid. There a numerous other one star reviews on Amazon under different flavors. Check them out before you spend your money thinking you're buying the old recipe your cats actually liked.",0
works great,1
I have purchased this multiple times and have always been very pleased. Thank you!,1
"Although I thought it was of good quality and a wonderful idea, my cat hated it and wouldn't use it.  He rides everywhere.",0
My Rats love this cage. I put fleece to cover the metal to protect  the rats feet.,1
Filter pump doesn't work so no need for them... Good price though,0
"I was living with someone who was adamant about buying the silica crystal litter, but I hated the stuff bc it had a terrible chemical smell, you could never tell when the crystals were saturated so then you'll get pools of cat pee at the bottom festering and smelling really bad when it's too late, and the stray crystals on the floor killed my feet every time I stepped out of the shower.

Then I bought this as a xmas gift and they tried it really skeptically.  But it clumps AMAZINGLY and it didn't smell at all.  So easy to clean bc of the clumping.  I have converted the people I was living with.  When I get my own cat, I will definitely stock up on this stuff.  Really is the world's best cat litter...",1
"Great biological filtration.
Seems to last forever without replacement.
I have it running on 3 seperate tanks.
Reasonably priced.",1
Dog loves it.,1
Awful product. This brand has gotten cheaper in quality. My dog made the bone crumble in less than 20 minutes.,0
Light weight,1
"Great item, although a little brittle.  In the first 6 months, the handle broke.  The break was at the upper handle, so the item still worked just fine.  For the next 2ish years I made due with it and had no issues.  I did notice some rusting on the spring that closes the jaws but it had no noticeable effect on the function.  Recently, I finally broke it completely. I was trying to open it in sub zero weather and the jaws had frozen together. When I tried to open it, it snapped where the jaws connect to the opening mechanism.  Over all, I probably got about 2 and change years out of it which I consider a good deal for a plastic tool that stays out in the weather.  I'm planing on buying an replacement.",1
Only lasted for 7 months and then the tray separated from the handle.  This was disappointing.,0
"The collar is colorful, all the folks at the vet's comment  on it. Of course he is the best cat boy ever and it reflects his personality!!",1
NONE of these batteries work!  Do not waste your money!,0
I used one for my pets and one for myself.  It works on the 3 1/2 cans.  Make sure of the size that you need.,1
"I should have listened to the reviews- I take responsibility for the size I should have checked that better, but I agree with one of the reviews, what I received looks nothing like the one in the photo- no eyes at all? this is very deceiving -you don't get what you are paying for and there is no better way to ensure no one buys your product than to lie about a product, the only people who will buy it is someone like me, and that will only happen once. This is downgraded to a cat toy and not worth the price - very disappointing.",0
Product does not work. Applied as instructed but there are absolutely no results. I would not recommend this at all. Very unsatisfied with this purchase.,0
stopped working under a year.,0
The size is large enough but the carrier was arrived broken. Had to return it,0
"I switched from a common brand you can find in the store.. to chicken soup.. and then found Halo. Although my boy is still getting used to the canned version, he really took to the dry indoor chicken formula from the beginning. I only feed to him as a snack. I'm impressed so far. The bite size is really small for digestion (kitten size I think), and unlike another review I read (on another website), it does NOT smell bad. To be honest, it smells like a good brand of whole-grain crackers you find in the grocery store, and comes in a zip-resealable bag that I really like. I hope I don't have to switch again for any reason. Billy gets confused and looks so unhappy whenever I change food (which I don't like doing unless I feel I have to, and is not good for him anyway), so I hope this is a keeper.",1
"I order 6 cases a month (on auto-ship) and it is extremely helpful to me that Amazon offers these to be delivered right to my door; cats love Fancy Feast;  and I feel better that they're eating a quality product.  One other thing - variety.  As anyone knows who has cats, variety is a must.  Thanks.",1
Perfect,1
"Will get coral polyp extension before your broadcast or spot feeding, however use it every other day and it will cause an algae bloom. Probably should only use once per week in a 20 gallon or smaller...",1
"This toy is great! I love that it's US made, and my cat loves to play with it. The tag said ""Smell the catnip"" - and you could tell right out of the box that it was stuffed with the good stuff!",1
it comes with six thin strip of jerky and rest of the bag is full of air.  Does not worth paying $12.,0
"I have 2 golden retrievers that ride in the back seat of my Ford truck and this seat cover takes all that they throw at it.  When it eventually does need to be washed it is easy to remove, wash and reinstall.  Very tough, can take the chewing and the mess that you don't want on your seats.",1
NIce!,1
Spills when tipped on its side and upside down. Wet my puppy' s bed and wet all the way through!,0
"Cats have to drink an enormous amount of water to offset the high amount of fiber in this.  Without ALOT of water intake, this stuff turns to concrete in their intestines.  My poor cat ate this for about a month and I noticed she was really having a hard time having a bowel movement. TMI warning:  I took her to the vet and x rays showed 3 huge impactions which were like concrete.  $700 later...she was okay and back home....but they had to keep her for several days and give her both oral stool softeners as well as several enemas.  It was a horrible ordeal for her and me!  I have her back on her canned food with lots of water added and a little bit of Blue Wilderness kibble and she is doing great.  I don't like to write bad reviews, but I would really like to prevent any other poor little kitties have this happen to them!  Not to mention, the ingredients are really quite poor; corn gluten meal and animal by products.",0
Dogs love the squeaky ball,1
"I was excited to receive this product because I thought for sure my dog wouldnt tear it up (at least not for a day or two). Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  My dog ripped through it within an hour after he got it.",0
Very great product worked very well to slow my dogs eating habits. Highly recommend this product to other's,1
The cats like the broth but not the solid contents. The packets seem like a good idea but they are difficult to handle once you tear off the top per instructions. My cats would purrrfer just the sauce. Take a hint Fancy Feast put out just sauce.,0
This does not work. I had it working for two days and now its just not doing anything.,0
"It's great for my dog. This is my second time buying this, I ordered to my parent's dog because it works great.",1
This dog product is not worth almost $27. I recently purchased at a reasonable $12.95 with Prime shipping. Not sure why the double in price in 2 weeks. Will stick with the better value Kong products for my dogs chew toys.,0
I am very happy with my New Cat Condo.  It is very sturdy and the carpeting is better than others I have owned.  I like the fact it is made in the USA and came fully assembled right out of the box.  I was looking for one with wood construction as the condos made from other materials fall apart very quickly.  I only had it out of the box about five minutes when my cats were on it.  I have two cats and they fight over who is getting the top level  LOL.  One of them finally consedes and settles on the second level.  One of my cats is about 18 lbs. and he fits comfortably on the second level.  I highly recommend this kitty condo.,1
"I was hesitant to buy bags at all simply because the first set I bought was a pack of 150 for $1 from a local pharmacy and they worked really well. Unfortunately, when I went back there the bags were no longer there.
So I gave in because I feel incredibly guilty leaving dog poo on the ground. These were a good choice. The rolls are much smaller than I realized but the bags are more than large enough for what my dog's droppings.
Just fyi, he is a ~15 pound Jack Russell Terrier Mix.
I don't really smell the lavender scent but they do have a scent that isn't unpleasant. Its more like some sort of cleaner that is trying to smell lavender-ish.
Anyway, I miss the handles for tying the bag from the set we used previously but aside from that, the Earth Rated doggie bags are strong, and get the job done.

4/27/18 Update - I purchased a different set after these ones. They were okay; did the job. But its the thing where you didn't know how good you had it til it was gone, haha. The other ones were painfully difficult to tear apart at the perforation line AND I actually appreciate the lavender-ish scent these ones have now. So great to have these back!
And I have two more dogs now, one who is 45 pounds and leaves a lot to clean up heh.",1
Works great.  Totally removed my elderly cat's matted fur.  And she likes it when I comb her.  I highly recommend it.,1
Really nice pouch for treats during training and walks. It props open with it's mechanical lock and collapses very secure. The size is a little bit larger than I'd like but it's very well made and easy to use.,1
"I searched for this product after a recommendation from a friend.  I have 5 cats...three Maine Coons who often have gum disease and one has already had surgery to correct serious problems.  We now brush two of the cat's teeth several times a week.  This product is touted to be a preventative for further problems, so thus the purchase.  So far, it seems to be helping, but time will tell.  The purchase went very well...quick delivery, and reasonable price.",1
didn't work,0
"it was fastened and half inflated per instructions, cat took it off in a minute, and punctured it at the same time.  Don't waste your time or money",0
"It was difficult to put together. The little clear o-rings were very stubborn. In the end, it was annoying to get in and didn't really do what I wanted. Of course, I wasn't sure I wanted an undergravel filter. I'm pretty sure my opinion isn't worth much on this product. Just stretch out the o-rings before you try to fit them on. :)",0
Recommended by my dogs groomer!,1
"Bought this for two reasons, 1. automate the task of feeding the cats when we're too lazy to do it ourselves or when we're traveling, 2. One cat is overwieght and needed a strict feeding regiment. You can set the # of feedings, the timing and the portion for each. We've been using it for a few months now and it meets both requirements nicely. I wish there was a human sized one, fat cat has lost 3 lbs. since we started using it. Two negatives 1. the need for big batteries, wish it used AA, AAA instead or had an AC adapter; 2. it's a great size, never had to worry about capacity or placement, but the big cat is beating it up to sneak food out and I wish it were too heavy for him to push around. We've wedged it under the dining table chairs for now and it is taking punishment like a champ. Main suggestion is that if you are going to buy this, buy it on Amazon instead of at a big box retailer and use Amazon prime; you'll probably save at least $12!",1
Chewer can't ruin it!,1
"This crate is very light, easy to set up and move.  I used it for my 7 month old Mastiff puppy at a weekend training seminar.",1
This is the best collar! My puppy looks incredible with it!,1
This product didn't work as well as it should plus it was too big . I had to constantly clean the groves in order for it to work properly . It was just a lot of work to upkeep,0
"This is a good leash but if two people are walking on a sidewalk, there isn't room for either the dog or one of the humans.",1
"Thin cheap metal, but cute and a good price.",1
I change the filter every month or so.,1
I've used it pretty often since the purchase and so far it's doing the job great. I do still put a bootie on my Australian Shepherd as her issue is her paw but she couldn't even move with the cone on and I couldn't trust her alone without MUCH proactive measures. So far she seems even comfortable in it. I've not tried it with a bare paw though but it hasn't lost any air like I read on other reviews and it's been at least a month I think. Over all.. very satisfied,1
"Great product! It does exactly what it says it will do. If you have a large tank or two (like me), you may not have time to do the monthly water change. It's great to have this product to adjust the water so it won't be too acidic. If the water PH is incorrect, some fish might start losing some of their scales and grow pale. Then you add some Ph UP, the water gets milky white for a while... like it's a smoke inside the fishtank. That's ok. It means the product is working!

I have 2 65-gallon tanks so I rely on this water adjuster all the time. And it works fabulously! If only I could find an adjuster for my life to do the same...",1
We have 60 horses and this product is effective and convenient for wound care. We discovered an added bonus with horses that rub their mane and tails. It helps to sooth itchy skin too. I highly recommend Stat spray.,1
My dogs really do not like this food. It sits in their bowls until they are too hungry to pass it up.,0
THIS IS GOOD BEDDING TO USE FOR THE HAMPSTERS. THEY LIKE TO MAKE THEIR BED WITH IT.,1
"It is a piece of garbage stopped working a few days after installed.  Slides up and down glass, won't stick. big pain ,.  Aweful product.",0
"My little guy loves this thing.  We keep it in the living room for him.  He threw up in it once when he was sick, but it was super easy to clean up with how easy the top is to take off of it.  Great portable kennel.",1
I love the lemongrass scent..My Chihuahua doesn't like the cedar scent because it causes breathing problems..,1
Worked fine when it did.  Battery stopped holding a charge within a few months of purchase and use.,0
Returned it.  It did not work for us as it went off all the time.,0

Love these toys but I only got three with the six pack :(,0
"Easy to put together, very nice quality, sturdy. Will update if my cats ever use it. Lol",1
junk,0
my cute 14lb dog loves it!!! he drags this lamb everywhere when he plays. So cute to see them together. This toy is very soft yet strong lol I love it! I would highly recommend for dog owners!,1
This product only works some of the time. The batteries always pop out when the dog shakes and sometimes it just stops working all together. When it does work it's ok. I have to have it on the highest setting just for it to have an impact. VERY frustrating product...DO NOT BUY!!,0
"Looks even better in person, the way the links are cut make it very sparkly.  Seems quite strong, well made.  It is more comfortable for my dog than a typical choke chain. She can't pull out of it.  The only draw back is she pulls a bit more because it's more comfortable on her neck.",1
too small for the size of doggie diaper,0
Very easy to adjust and works great I'm Very pleased with this product.......,1
"We have a couple of these bins for our several pups.  This one is great--its design allows for sticking it in narrow places.  We have it between the back-up fridge and sink in the laundry room.  Perfect place.  Just keep it hidden...laundry room, closet, etc.  It's just a plastic bin, not meant to be displayed.  Great value!",1
Great table! This one is not collapsable.,1
This worked well in my car interior.,1
"This is a fantastic bowl for brachycephalic (short nose) dogs!!!  Before I got this bowl, my Frenchie would only eat her food at the ""top"" of her bowl.  I would have to rake the rest of her food back to the top of her bowl so she could finish her food.  With the Loving Bowl, she now eats every last piece without me having to touch her food! Frenchies are known for having flatulence issues.  Since she's been eating out of this bowl, she isn't gulping her food down and there isn't as much flatulence!  Great bowl!  Wonderful design!  Great customer service!!",1
"Our cat is quickly outgrowing this size, but it's perfect for smaller, almost grown kittens.  I recommend these things to everyone though.",1
One of the legs came apart from the particle board after the 1st use. Worthless junk!,0
"BEWARE: this collar is dangerous! Despite being labeled as a ""safety break-away collar"", this product is a safety hazard for cats and should never be used without constant pet supervision. I used this collar on my 4 year old cat as he has anxiety and expresses  it by peeing in places he shouldn't. My vet recommended the collar. When I put the collar on him, I made sure it was tight enough that he couldn't get it off. He wore it 6 days until one morning, when I wasn't home, he got his lower tooth/jaw caught in the plastic buckle. He spent the next several hours clawing at his face until it bled, and running through the entire house rubbing his face on things trying to get it off.  When I got home,  both he and my entire house were covered in blood.  The collar had to be cut off, his mouth and gums were cut up terribly and he was terrified. It took hours to clean him up, days to clean up my house, and nearly a month for him to heal physically. It was a very unpleasant experience for both of us.
So do yourself and your pet a favor and stay away from this product!",0
Medium size vest WILL NOT fit a dog of 45lbs. We also did not get any forms or paperwork with the jacket so that we could return the item or swap for a larger size.,0
The collar has worked excellently.,1
It was and very good price,1
"I have tried a couple of different types of poop bags from Amazon and this is my favorite by a LONG shot. Bags are super easy to open, important in the winter time or when you want to scoop before three million people walk awkwardly by. The bags are also both big and long enough. I have two Australian shepherds with medium (sometimes large) sized poops. I can sometimes scoop both dogs' with one bag. They also smell nice and are pretty. Easy to pretend you have something fancier in the bags. Glad I finally found bags that work for me. Will be a fan for a long, long, time.",1
Our cat loves this unit.  It did require assembly but it didn't take long.,1
"this item DOES run smaller, so get the next size up other than that it was very soft, came fast, and even though i had to save it aside for my new puppy not the dog i intended to buy for, i was still pleased",0
"Based on the size chart Ordered the XXL for my boxer/pit mix and its too small, so I had to return it. Besides, he said it was too girly for him and the other dogs would laugh at him. ",0

"One of our dogs loved it, but began chewing the rubber off of it almost immediately. I don't think this toy even lasted 24 hours.",0
"Very disappointed in this purchase.  Purchased Sep 2016 and by Christmas 2016 the collars barely hold a charge and by Spring 17 neither hold a charge or work.  I am now on here searching for another device to replace in less than a year.  Our use of these collars and purpose was to deter barking, and it did that beautifully during the time in which they worked.  Our use of them was on the VERY low side.  We used them steadily at time of purchase and for about a month - then only as needed for the behavior modification.  So it is disheartening that they with such little use are worthless now.  :-(",0
Cute toy but no squeaker inside.,0
Our 10 years old Chihuahua loves this as she can get up on the bed easier....thanks so much...,1

"This brand chew toy is by far one of the best that I've found for price and durability. Kong and other ""indestructible"" toys only last a couple of weeks (if not days) with my puppy. This has lasted several months so far. She's only managed to chew off the ears. The rest is still intact. Also one of her favorites and since several of this line are being discontinued, I bought a couple of spares.",1
"We have had this tool for a few years now. We also have two fairly rough coat Border Collies. Usually we get them to the groomers quarterly and that keeps their undercoats under control. We are behind and I pulled my grooming tools out to give both a few minutes of work on some problem areas. That oh so soft handle? It is now a sticky mass of goo. Hopefully they have a different formula for that material now. The tool works well, the handle has a major flaw. Fix the handle and it is a solid four stars.",0
My puppy broke threw the divider the first night and then had the metal chewed through after two weeks and he was only in it for an hour a day a few days a week,0
"This gave my cat the most incredibly, unbelievable, completely liquid, bright green diarrhea which contained gigantic (several tablespoons each) globs of mucous in it.  It lasted for three days.  My roommate found where I had hid it (for donation/cruel?) and fed it to him again about three weeks later.  The same thing happened.

My cat would look at me and scream, go over to the litter box and howl some more, and would only get in the box with serious encouragement.  He was completely freaked out a few times per hour.  All I can say is there must be something in there (mackerel?) that may be an allergen to some cats.  Buyer be cautious.  AMAZON WILL NOT TAKE RETURNS ON PET FOOD.  I strongly recommend that you order this only if you have tried the ""Tiki Mackerel & Sardine in calamari consomme"" with earlier success before you invest in this.

"Kong should not sell, they are known for items lasting... these do not.

I have a 5 month old small Terrier mix, she is a chewer so I learned to steer clear of stuffed animal versions of any sort for dogs, she choose them up and out comes the stuffing, although she loves them. I had great success with standard tennis balls, she loves fetching them and has never ripped up any... not for the lack of trying. So when I spotted squeaking tennis balls.... bonus.... well that was short lived. Bummer... one of these lasted a whole 2 days and now the side of one is completely chewed off... all the furry part is gone and the inside ball is exposed (the squeaky part).

She is a small dog... so thought for sure longer than 2 days. Would not recommend these and will stick to the other harder rubber kong versions.",0

"This Lavien Braided Leather Leash is top quality and has a beautiful design. The braided leather near the clasp and just below the handle is a stylish detail on the dark brown leash. It is 6 feet long and 3/4 inches wide, perfect for a large dog but also for a smaller one.  The leather is 3/16 inches thick and looks like it is hand rubbed and oiled. It is The stitching and detail is beautifully done. This is the type of leash that will last for years and years. Leather gets even more beautiful as it's broken in and softened. I like that the leather is very comfortable in my hand, much more so than the nylon type of leash that I was using before. It's easier to hang onto and there's much less danger of it slipping out of my hand. It's just more comfortable to hold.

The latch hook is substantial and clasps easily. It's a brass color but I'm not sure what the metal is. It stays connected to the dogs collar until it's taken off.

This would be a thoughtful, high quality gift to give to someone who has a new dog. It's something that would last after toys and other leashes might be broken or discarded. This leash is easy to maintain with an occasional cleaning with a leather cleaner and conditioner or saddle soap.

A sample was provided for review.",1
This was the worst product ever,0
works great,1
"If your dog is going to chew on a couple of balls, it may as well be these two. Say Chuckit instead of...well, you know.",1
SO far its working the way it should. Easy to program. Only thing I don't like that its too top heavy. Cats have tipped it over twice. Ive had to mount it to a piece of wood.,1
Size runs way small,0
"It was a good antler but it was far from giant. Probably 4"" My dog ate it in one night. Just a little nub left in the morning.",0
I would not buy this again. It did nothing for the fleas and left a greasy mess on my cats.,0
My cat has become very picky and he LOVES this food!,1
"I will never buy this stuff again. The smell is overwhelming. It doesn't hide the piss smell, just adds a layer of perfume that you can detect from about six feet away. It also sticks terribly to my cat's fur, which I've never experienced with any other litter. Every time she uses it she comes away covered it in.",0
"The  supposedly ""strong,"" PVC material seams split almost immediately after being filled with water.  The cardboard soaked up water disintegrated and it collapsed.  Wasted money and time!!",0
"Dog loves them, and we feel good about the ingredients.",1
pretty thin and so so quality,0
"So cute and the bell is so much better than any of the ones I've purchased before. However, our cat does not like the flower, had to remove it.",1
"Got this for my bengal cat. It took some getting used to, but he found this harness much more comfortable than the cat harnesses I had tried. Great product!",1
Love these and my dog doesn't seem to mind wearing these.,1
"Purchased for my dog to protect his fragile claws in bad weather and on long walks.  The material for the paw part is good quality, but not worth the price.  On top of which the design is difficult to put on and doesn't stay on well.  I spent most of the short walk I took him on just trying to get one or the other one back on.  For the short period of time they stayed on they seemed to suit fine, but my dog absolutely refused to let me get them on him a second time.  It's hard to argue with a shepherd mix once he's made up his mind and he did NOT like the tight sock and narrow opening.  Very unhappy with this product.",0
My Golden Retriever sheds a lot and this brush does an excellent job of  removing the loose hair.  It also does an excellent job of untangling snarls.  My dog seems to enjoy being brushed with it also.,1
Wonderful for giving your dogs medicine.  The chicken is the best to me for them it is not greasy like the others.,1
"I have a pretty rug that my sister was getting rid of because she fostered kittens and they peed all over it. I started by washing it with my hose and antibacterial dish detergent and laundry detergent, which seemed to get the stains out but the urine odor was still pretty strong. I then ordered this product and sprayed the rug down on the front and back and let it air dry for a day. Now its like new! I didn't get to try this product for stains, but it worked great for odors. I would definitely recommend it for cat urine odors - even odors that have been set in for a while.",1
Nice oversized bag  been using these bags for 6 months now they are great i i am ordering more today,1
"I bought this dog toy based on great reviews.  Not!  My 1 year old dog has plenty of Kong rubber toys that hold up to her moderate chewing habits.  Within 10 minutes of giving my dog this toy, she chewed off one of the spikes.  I won't give it to her again; really?  I e-mailed the company wanting some feedback on the issue and I received absolutely no response from them.  Money completely wasted.  I will stick to Kong products that I can depend on and they have not let me down.",0
I received the wrong product instead of a shirt I received some type of candy. I am highly disappointed because the shirt was for photos with Santa tomorrow now that's not going to happen and then on top of that I have to go through the hassel of returning the product and watching my credit card statement for the credit. Please do a better job of quality control.,0
I've owned a number of kitty wands and this is by far the best. Most of the others are strings with toys at the end and the cats pull off the toy pretty quickly so it needs to constantly be replaced. This dance is great because the cat plays with the entire length of it and the material is colorful and stretchy and the kitties love it. Very durable.,1
"I have had this light fixture for 45 days and already half of the LEDs have stopped working. I have yet to contact Marineland to request that it be replaced, but regardless of the outcome this is a sub par product.",0
"My Australian shepherd and I have been through a lot of frisbees. This one is the best, and I will continue to buy it for as long as they are available. It flies just as good as the light-weight plastic frisbees and doesn't hurt her mouth at all. The size is perfect for her. She's about 45 lbs., smallish Aussie. I can tell it will eventually get destroyed from her teeth marks all over it, but we've been using it for several months now and it's still going. It's definitely worth it.",1
Very effective at removing that nasty skim off the top of the water. If you have a tank with no sump this is an easy way to keep that oil slick off the surface of the water.,1
"Very high quality, with a nice sound.  Made in USA.  I purchased this for my dogs collar, to give the animals in my yard a fighting chance.  I think it would be too large for a small dog, but works fine for my 40lb dog.  I will definitely be looking into more from this company, because the quality is impressive.",1
"It is with great success that I've used this product in the past FROM ANOTHER SELLER. I was so pleased to purchase this at a reasonable price here. As soon as I received it, I applied it to our dogs, with the correct dosage and proper application. A day later, a few days later, even a week later, we are still removing live ticks from our dogs:( this was a huge waste of money!",0
Our 2 small dogs really seemed to enjoy them.  Always good to find a treat that is 'healthy'.,1
"My cats love these bugs!  They do claw and bite at them, and so far, they have remained indestructible.  One of the best interactive toys I have found.",1
"I like the idea of this litter box, but the holes are too big for the pellets and they fall through. The lid also does not snap on correctly and my cat knocked it off everytime he tried to get in/out.",0
its not the best but for the $ it is the best.,1
To big. It's also hard material so not good to throw in the house & I can't see it being good outside,0
My dog is been playing with this toy for the past 6 months. He is a good boy so that helps a lot in terms of durability but the product is good quality in general.,1
Positive side the harness looks handsome on our pup. But so very disappointed in this harness! The webbing ia fraining on both sides of the handle. Our pup is a puller thats why we got this harness but there is no way to keep the chest strap from loosing so the harness ends up on the side of him.,0
"Hey guys.  All these bad reviews are because someone didn't read information and description BEFORE ordering these very effective chew tos for TOY BREED puppies.  Also when you get the package it states clearly to  NEVER LEAVE YOUR DOG UNATTENDED while the bone is in use. If the dogs were being watched the owner could have removed the toy before problems occurred.  Bad reviews shouldn't be given because of ""owner error"".

That said, any toy could be of danger. I've been a dog trainer for a long time, and the tales of dog injesting squeakers and/or stuffing, and having emergency surgery are very common.  Bottom line is to read the package info on your dogs toys first and then follow them. Hope this helps",1
"This is really nice and looks great on the wall,  but it just fits in to the space I had for it.  I did not measure and it was larger then I thought.  Most other similar items are smaller,  but I liked this one so I just ordered it.  As long as you have the space this is fine and id very handy.",1
I love the long handles.  I prefer one in which the tool used to lift the debris is larger and with more bend in it.,1
I got this to take my oldest cat to the vet so he'd be more comfy. I put it out so all my cats could get used to it and my smallest cat decided that this is her bed now. She gets in it all the time and lies down and takes baths. She just loves it. I almost hate to borrow it from her to take Bootsie to the vet. I love it!,1
the metal part broke within a month of use----now i can't return it ----cheap product,0
"My dog loves them  After a few years of giving them as treats, I believe my dog has become addicted.",1
"I loved the idea of this, as our guinea pig loves to look out of her cage. The problem was that she was afraid of it, and didn't seem to understand the concept of backing up. We had a hard time getting her out of it, and we tried many different positions.

In my opinion, don't buy this unless you are planning on trying it for your ferret!!!",0
"After two months we still have to put it on every day. It's not healing the dryness, it just masks it. It has not worked at all.",0
Gave my dogs horrible diarrhea,0
My dog loves these and they last a long time.,1
my dog still got fleas within a month of putting this on,0
"My kitty can only have Lamb and Rice in the mornings.  I've ordered this a couple of times now. With this last order I found out the hard way that they mixed in cans of beef pate and cheated me our of about 8 cans of the lamb and rice.  Shame on you for cheating your customers and putting pets in danger. Check your purchases closely to make sure you have not been cheated.
This system made me give at least 1 star.  They don't deserve any stars!",0
"I bought this door expecting a great fit. Vertically it adjusts and fits fantastic......... the bad part is that rarely is any sliding glass door is perfectly square. Most screen doors contain a locking mechanism and other brackets that are typically used. I had to remove all hardware that normally enable the door to lock. My  door was not perfectly square and the insert did not create a uniform seal. I had to spend an additional $20 on weather stripping and apply it to the inserts top and the side that rests against the frame of the door jam, more along the bottom once installed and additional to weather stripping was applied to the existing sliding door in order to create a complete seal. Additionally i had to cut a piece of wood that i could wedge in to press the sliding door against the dog door to get the seal between the two surfaces to be effective as the installation instructions were not clear and it appeared that permanent modification of the existing screen door would be required.",0
Great buy. My dog and cat love it so far. Makes grooming simple. Easy to clean after use. Would definitely recommend.,1
"Took it out of the box, felt it and threw it directly in the trash. Feels like sandpaper",0
"Tetra used to make a very good mechanical filter, but not anymore......very noisy, the impeller well sounded like it didn't purge all the air out of it after start-up(even though it did), & the motor was hot to the touch. I bought one & returned it to Amazon a day later. Very disappointing & really is a piece of pure junk. I also wrote Tetra about their awful product when I returned this a few months ago, & have yet to receive a response from them. So much about caring what customer's think.....I will not buy another Tetra filter & recommend anyone thinking about doing so NOT to. Waste of time & money.",0
"My puppers loves eating this food, seriously! He isn't a picky eater at all, but normally is just a regular eater, as in will eat when he's hungry. Not with this food! He eats it the minute it is put into his bowl!",1
"I am not thrilled with this bark collar. I was really hoping it would help with my dog's barking....because his barking can be more than a little annoying and embarrassing. I charged the collar appropriately, and I put it on with high hopes. It did absolutely nothing....I mean nothing. I dialed up the settings to a more ""sensitive"" setting, and it still did nothing at all. My dog continued his insane barking as if I had put a scarf around his neck. So...I have yet another bark collar just lying on the counter accomplishing nothing at all. I'm not sure why creating an effective bark collar seems to be next to impossible in 2016, but it sure seems that way. I'm so frustrated.",0
"This is the only way I can get my dogs to take any pills or vitamins. They are soft, easy to use and I buy the larger ones and use half for 1-3 small pills to save money. It is like meat putty for your dogs pills. They hear the bag and they come running.",1
My pets love this toy!!!,1
This food smells very good to my dog. She went through two 10-lb bags and she was getting bored towards the end of the second bag. This food is basically potato flakes and very few chicken pieces. She had good energy but the stool was loose. I will put this food as a part of her rotation diet but it is not a long-term food choice for us. It is an excellent choice for dogs who have kidney problem or seniors.,1
"My dog will not eat this. He gobbles down Keen, Verve, and Force, but walks away from this. I even tried feeding it to him with my fingers to see if he would like it after a few bites, but he still wouldn't eat it from the bowl. I can see that it's a good, healthy food but I can't use it.",0
"From a human standpoint, these don't smell savory,  but my dog loves them, and I love them. He finds them tasty, and I find his breath infinitely better for having had them. He's always had trouble with tartar and bad teeth, but these do help. They aren't fatty like pig ears, nor are they ""rawhide."" First four contents in order: wheat gluten, modified starch, gelatin and pineapple fiber. They also come in a ""mintz"" option, and I prefer that style when I sniff them. The last time I looked, Amazon didn't have those. But I can't quarrel with the dog's nicer breath even with the regulars. I don't find them in supermarkets or most stores, and the one local store that carries them doesn't carry a lot in stock.",1
Only downside is the frequency of filter changes.  They recommend every 2 weeks.,1
Does not giggle enough for my dogs.,0
Dogs love it and it really is waterproof. Wish I could buy another one but looks like Amazon no longer selling,1
"Frankly, I'm not sure how well this worked. Our dog suffers from anxiety and seemed to calm her neediness down a bit the first few days, but that definitely wore off quickly. I feel like this collar probably works well at ""full potency"" but there is no way that it lasts a full month. Maybe a full week. It's far too pricey for me to buy 4x a month so I will not be purchasing an Adaptil collar again.",0
Flimsy.,0
"This review is for the Best Disposable Underpads, Puppy Super-Absorbent Wee Wee Housebreaking Training Underpads With Non-Permeable Layer At The Bottom And Sides, Wide Range Of Sizes Available, Top Quality Made in USA by Pastell.
I purchased these training pads for my medium sized dog.  I must say that these are great.  We've had a problem with her doing her ""business"" in the house every now and then, right near the back door.  Since we have placed these pads down, she has had only a few accidents and each time it has been on the pad.  It was easy cleanup and she almost seemed drawn to it.  We are very happy with these training pads.

Disclaimer: I purchased this item at a discounted price or received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
Great quality panels,1
The cover does not stay on...as our bunny rolls around the cover always comes loose and falls off.,0
dogs love it!!,1
Smaller than expected. And there was no cooling device to keep it cool.  Waste of money.,0
good pump for my 250 gallon aquaponics setup.,1
"I read that this was a top choice for inexpensive controllers. I sadly cannot figure to how to properly set it. In the attempt to change to Farhrenheit, which I did have to go online to find a video in order to even get that far, I managed to cause it to just constantly blink on the top read out. The instructions aren't that clear, at least not to me.....I contacted the company by email...no response. So, not sure whether to send it back or put in a drawer and forget about it. I have a small tank and small needs to keep it running optimally. Really frustrating. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who wasn't an expert in these sorts of devices. Too bad really.",0
"Cost effective and good to keep up with our dogs reoccurring sensitive skin. She has put on some weight recently and i am not sure if the Salmon Oil is connected, but it has improved her coat and skin.",1
"When I bought the Pet Barrier the price was unbeatable. I have not been disappointed. I own a Nissan Rogue which has been the primary vehicle for the Pet Barrier. It fits fine, not perfect but it holds back my beagle.",1
My birds love these!,1
Clean breath but causes runny stools on both of my dogs.,1
It is really shocking how much cat fur this magic wand can summon. My cat must have lost a pound in weight after a full grooming! The handle is ergonomic and the discharge is mostly successful at cleaning the teeth. I believe its comfortable for the little one as well -- no scratches or complaints with this one!,1
"Returning for refund.  Outer covering is heavy canvas and not waterproof, inner lining is low quality felt which will stick to horses hair coat. This particular blanket had a strong musty smell when opened as if had been stored wet.",0
Worked as expected,1
Product is cheaply made and has an awful smell I couldn't get rid of. Have to squeeze with the strength of a strongman to move water into bowl. Leaks all over the place. VERY poor quality. Do NOT recommend!,0
Upset my dogs stomach perhaps to rich. Ended up with very soft stool.,0
Our dog is happy.,1
This worked perfect for the first day. I had my Australian Shepard/Chihuahua mix neutered and the traditional cone made him absolutely panic. He was literally running at full speed into my legs and walls to try and knock the cone off. I was desperate to find something that would both protect him from harming his incision and be more comfortable for him to wear and see. I only put it on him at night as during the day he stayed under my constant supervision so I was able to keep him from touching his incision. Well the first night went well he just used it as a pillow. The second night not so much. I heard a bit of commotion and went to check on him he was able to push this up high enough to bite it. That's all it took. One bite and it deflated before I could stop him. It has a great concept just needs a non inflatable core of some sort.,0
I am not a fan of this drinking bowl for dogs. its awkward to clean. It does not filter water as the pump is not likely strong enough to stir around debris and thus i am left with particles still in the bottom of the bowl and dander floating.  the charcoal filter is  a slit thats inserted into a resivoir however the filter seems to be to small and the water just spills over the filter...I do not reccomend.,0
My dog won't even touch it.,0
buckles did not hold sizing - rendered useless because I constantly had to readjust. Pretty big design flaw for a harness.,0
It's cute but it what not what the  picture looks like. Fewer studs,0
"I love the idea of this comfy harness.  But, my dog's anatomy & lack of obedience (due to owner's character flaws), allowed said dog to slip out of the harness at several, inopportune times.",0
"A adorable coat , my dog not only looked cute but was warm . I just wish she had not gotten so big so soon because it no longer fits.",1
"I am taking care my daughter's two adult cats in my home for a few weeks.  Since I was concerned about damage they might do to carpet and furniture, I ordered the PetFusion Scratcher/Lounge.  They have loved it from the first experience.  I did rub it with catnip in the beginning and that drew them right to it. One or the other of the two cats is always on it -- scratching and then ""lounging.""  I am very, very pleased with this product which I found on Amazon.",1
"I went to the company's web site to read instructions about measurements and followed their directions including ordering down if between sizes. These were to be for the back legs of a small German Shepherd with hip and leg problems who slips on our wood floors.  The width was tight and possibly could fit after numerous wearings, but I doubt it. The length is the biggest problem; these barely came above her paw and certainly not over her ankle/hock where it should extend in order to be secure.  I had even ordered double sided self adhering 1/2"" velcro straps to use at the top of the socks.  After walking around the dining table, it was apparent that the socks were already slipping off.  These are NOT made for large dogs even if the width works as the length is problematic.  I think I will buy some kid's socks and some Dip-It and make my own.

That being said the quality of the item looks good, so if you have a small dog, these may work well for you.",0
Good product,1
"My dog, NOT a fussy eater, refuses to eat these.  She ate one and never again.  Very strong odor.  Rubbery consistency.  Not at all like the great
""jerky"" treats by Zuke's  Wish I could get my money back",0
"For whatever reason, our dog doesn't drink water as much as she should. We had a large plastic bowl in the kitchen next to her food bowl & a metal bowl in our master bathroom for the middle of the night, but she still never drank a lot. Figured we should get something for her crate when she's in there a few hours every day, but she barely ever drinks from it. I know our original metal bowl started to stink after a few weeks (too much standing water caused it to stink?) hence the plastic bowl in the kitchen. This hasn't started to do that yet (we try to change the water at least twice a day despite her not drinking any), but I wish we could find a way to get her to drink more! Not really the bowl's fault though I guess.",1
Came broken and missing pieces. If it wasn't for that it's a nice product and adds some color to my tank.,0
My baby just loves these snacks and I love them cause there healthy for him,1
Seems to be easy to break down and set up. Our six month old lab is 50 lbs and he has plenty of room to grow. Plus I like the idea of more air flow for travel and warmer weather.,1

ITS like the size of my love seat and lol i just have to say maybe i should of got a size smaller? i wanted to make sure she had enough room to sprawl out and she has more than enough room..THATS FOR SURE! At first i didn't understand why she wouldnt lay down and its because  she didn't have it in her lay down spot in the living room..so i had to move it by the loveseat..all is well now! she can completely sprawl out on this and it keeps her hair inside the bed.. i think the best way to get the hair out with this would be using one of those pet hair rollers.. :) im very happy and i cant believe the size for the price! Even all three of my kids under age 6 fit in the bed with her when shes laying in it...so cute watching them pretend its their home with the dog.. :) i will update if there are any problems :)

UPDATE: (NOV 9TH)
ITS STILL TOGETHER :) ITS NOT ALL COVERED IN HAIR BY MY SHEPHERD.. AND SHE SLEEPS IN IT AT THE FOOT OF OUR BED NOW INSTEAD OF ON OUR BED MAKING OUR BED HAIRY :) I LOVE THIS BED! I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE! I EVEN OFTEN WAKE UP AT 5AM TO GET THE KIDS READY FOR SCHOOL AND FIND MY 3 YEAR OLD LAYING IN IT SLEEPING WITH THE DOG CURLED UP IN HIS BLANKET... :) PLENTY OF ROOM TO SHARE :) LOL",1
Honestly I don't think this product works one bit. Soaking it or washing it with it does not remove cat urine from our dog bed. Straight vinegar works better!,0
Came in the mail broken.  Won't even heat my tank up. Don't buy,0
My miniature schnauzer took this apart in less than an hour.  Not worth the money.,0
I have no real thoughts about the tank itself since I received it cracked. Took it out of the box all excited to set up and there was a 8 inch long crack along the bottom of the tank. I am returning it for exchange ... Hope I have better luck (and shipping) on my 2nd attempt.,0
"Useless, cat could easily get it off with just Velcro, it needed a way to loop it to her collar, it would have been nice if it would have had that one feature",0
"This food is small enough for my Shih-tzu to eat comfortably. He usually takes a couple of kernels to place on the floor to invite the ants in. But, seriously, it does reduce the amount and odor of his waste. Just be careful of the amount of human food or treats you give your little one!",1
My dog loves her dingos,1
Have noticed a huge improvement in the dogs' coats since we started using this product!,1
The splash guard is great with no more food and water on the floor.  Great color choices too.,1
It was too large for my dog to play with and she was actually scared of it.  I ended up giving it to a child who wasn't interest in it really.,0
"I'm not even sure this dog bedis worth the one star I am giving it.  It is flimsy and poorly made.  It is worth less than half what I paid.  Don't buy this item. I am so sorry that I did!  I found something similar at Costco that was less in price, durable and very well made.  Which is what I thought I was getting when I purchased this.",0
Great!,1
"My cat absolutely loves and craves catnip!

The CONs:

My cat doesn't like this product at all. He sniffs it and just passes it by and won't touch it. I have tried crushing some between my palms to release the aromas and putting it in a bowl and he still ignores it. Either it isn't catnip or there is little or none of what my cat loves about catnip in these ""buds"".

He does go absolutely crazy for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OurPets-Premium-North-American-Grown-Catnip-4-Ounce-Jar/dp/B005CGUUJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OurPets Premium North-American Grown Catnip, 4-Ounce Jar</a>

The PROs:

I have re-purposed the nice Meowijuana container to hold the previously named product.

Nice artwork and nice decals and stickers. Would be nice if the product lived up to its' hype!",0
The product description stated the price was for two flyer toys and it came with only one.,0
Works well just as expected,1
Always super.,1
"Came as billed, delivered timely.  Worked as it should.",1
I received a bad batch of food which resulted in my dog becoming very ill with blood in her stool and having to bring her to the emergency vet over the weekend.  I hope that Merrick recalls this lot immediately!,0
"I went between 2 and 3 stars. It is just OK. It looks super cute, but the fit and function and total crap. The straps do not stay adjusted and constantly loosen up. This might work for a small dog if you could secure the adjustments, but it is useless for a rabbit or guinea pig. The way the straps sit, they can slip right out. I had to fix it every 60 seconds or so. There are functionally much better products on the market. While it is cute, I would not recommend it for actual use. I can see animals getting hurt or lost using this harness.",0
"This is an interesting concept and I thought I would give it a try.  This product actually worked well right out of the box. Muscle fatigue set in after about 20 clays.  My arms were sore for 3 - 4 days afterwards.  :)  It takes a good bit of force to pull the bands back.  I was not impressed with the speed of the clay at all.  It was nice to be able to point in any direction to add difficulty for the shooter.  Mine came with a replacement band included.  The first band broke after a couple of outings and the second one dry rotted after a couple of months.  I suggest buying many replacement bands.  The plastic hand throwers work just as well, they are more reliable and they don't take but a fraction of the effort as this thrower does.  I upgraded to the champion whirlybird this year with no regrets.",0
"Have not actually taken my 16 pound cat for a ride in it yet, but I have left the carrier out in the open for him to familiarize himself with it, and he seems to love it. Before he was always terrified of the plastic hard-case carriers. I've actually found him sleeping inside this carrier during the day. Soft inside, seems very sturdy, and inviting enough to sleep in. Seems like a winner to me.",1
No complaints about on time delivery.  This item is not of quality material.  The picture makes it looks sturdy..it is not even close.  While this may work for upkeep after a professional grooming it does not work on any pets with longer coats.  Hit a tangled spot and it bends almost in half..  I am not unhappy with the purchase per se though I wished the picture gave a better representation so no one else buys something they can't really use.,0
"Definitely cute, had some problems with the lattice strips staying put had to nail them in place. The roof needed to be  more secured so I used some roofing nails that I had. It's okay for the price but I should have just put another $80 out & bought another Kitty Tube for longevity.",1
"Was really disappointed with the cat tree. Very un-sturdy, and sharp on the edges. Saw all these great reviews, but definitely didn't work for me.",0
I have been using this product for years as well as many other dog owners I know - it is not over price for a great product,1
"Our rats love these things like CRAZY. I just wish you could specify colors, because the pink and yellow are a little eye searing.",1
This harness and leash is great! Its so easy to use and safe. Bleu loves it.,1
Well worth the money if your cat used to leave liter throughout the house! My at is 16 lbs and fits in here without a problem.,1
I was supposed to get a 30 pound bag what the hell is a 5 pound bag doing on my door step even at the pet store down the road its 35 for a 30 pound bag I want my money back and I'm not paying return shipping,0
"This is a nice quality product really helped to reduce the noise. Fit perfectly on my 30inch. tank, the included plastic section was easy to cut to accommodate filters and other tank hardware.",1
This would probably be good for a dog that is not an aggressive chaser.  Mine had chunks out of it in minutes.,0
Not very plush.  Hardly any depth to it.,0
"Great concept. Terrible product. Just after the warranty ran out my door stopped working. Hi Tech immediately said the mother board was bad. $100 later the door did not work and I did not have time. When I got around to the installation, the new mother board had the same issues. Hi tech told me to test my power adapter (?) and that my new mother board was just out of the 90 day free return policy. Options? Send it in at my cost (leaving a hole in my wall) or purchase a new one. Never again hi tech.",0
Not as durable as expected.,1
The batteries lasted less than 4 hours.  I loved it for the first five days.  Maybe I just got a bad one,0
She loves it! And her poops aren't as smelly!,1
"We call this ""Tower of Tracks"" the ""Tower of Terrors""...in a good way. I've had this cat toy for about a year now, & it is still the favorite toy with my cats. I guess it must be the 3 levels of balls. When they attack one ball, all 3 balls are spinning in different directions on all 3 levels. The reason we call it the tower of terrors is because my biggest, strongest cat (who is very rough with his toys) plays with this thing for hours. He even tips it on its side & knocks it upside down, & the balls are still spinning. Just a really great toy to keep cats entertained.",1
"my dog loves this food and it adds fiber to her diet.  I split it up and feed it over several days (half in fridge, half in freezer)  for a nine pound dog, mixing with her dry food I get 6 days of feeding with 1 can.  she really enjoys it and I like giving her veggies as much as possible",1
"My at is a small Abyssinian.
I tried to introduce this by putting her treats on there but this thing just can't hold even for a sec when she jumps on.
I do not recommend this to anyone,
0 stars.",0
"Very small. Large chihuahua, maybe....",0
Works great for my 2 cats.,1
The dog ate in less than 10 min.  Had to put dog cone of shame back on....sorry pooch.,0
Perfect small treat!,1
"The dogs loved this. It squeaks everywhere, so if you don't like noise, skip this one. Reasonably priced and cute...the gator has a little ""personality""...more important to humans than to the dog.",1
"We've tried it, so far we've liked it. The cats are now using the litter box instead of the carpet, and that was the goal. I hope that it will stay like that.",1
It's about as big as a quarter. Maybe.,0
"I have a small puppy, 2 months old, weighing 7.5 lbs. This product is about 8"" wide! Even a newborn puppy of the smallest size in this country will not fit in this. This is a straight rip-off. Stay away from these Chinese products. I was a fool who didn't. There is also no way of returning a $7.63 product back to China. it will cost me more to  return it. Amazon should not sell these kinds of products in the United States.",0
No problems!,1
"I have a 6yr on mini schnauzer.  Her breath was humming.  It was so bad i want to see if listerine in her water would help ( no just kidding that stuff is deadly to us to swallow nevermind by baby).  I bought these as well a Greenies.  I trade off each day on and the other.  Plus I bought a additive for her water by Virbac call C.E.T. AquaDent Drinking Water (purchased from my Vet,)  I could not be happier.  My lil one's breath is perfect.  No odor or killer halitosis.

p.s.  I just checked and the Virbac CET is available on Amazon as well ($3 dollars cheaper that what I bought it )
That being said because it is hard to confirm whether the selling is actually selling the proper product you may still want to buy from a local vet or per supplier.  Product should arrive aluminum vacuum seal.  If not return it.",1
These are the best kennel crate mats I have found anywhere at this price!,1
We have given Zukes treats to our puppy before and she loved the. These are a different kind and she likes them - but NOT like the others,1
Really gets that fish poop out of the tank.  Cuts down rock cleaning by half.  I'm not yelling at the fish as much as I did before.,1
Bought this collar and started using it September 1st and it broke about 2 weeks ago - just makes a continual clicking noise when you put a new battery in it.  I've owned 3 bark collars so far and this one is by far the least durable.  Very disappointed with it!,0
"I really like this product. After using it, there is no smell of dog urine.",1
"I love these and I'm going to say it again, I love these.  I have 3 cats and a Pomeranian.  I have hair everywhere.  I was spending so much time vacuuming and it didn't really get it all and I have a good vacuum and attachments.  I found this is my linen closet, forgot I had it, thought couldn't hurt to try it, I wish I remembered I had it a long time ago, it gets ALL  hair up.  The downside is the pads can't really be reused and they are a little expensive, but I'd say it's worth it to have clean furniture and not have to be embarrassed to have people sit down on the sofa.",1
"I have bought the 8 inch jolly ball on a rope and was MUCH happier with it.  Although my dog got through the rope in two minutes, the ball itself lasted almost 8 months.  With this one my dog ripped the handle off right away and it was hollow inside!  So no way to play with it in water with him because there was a big hole.  He wouldn't even look at it after 30 minutes and went back to the old one I bought before.",0
I didn't smell any improvements after daily use for 2 weeks.,0
The style was perfect but made for a puppy the size of the tag was small!,1
"This thing is awesome!  It has performed above the my expectations.  Ensure you change to trays as directed, but it does a superb job of cleaning the litter box.  I have two cats and they both use the box without any issues.",1
"After reading positive reviews, I ordered this product but it has not calmed my dog at all.  Would not recommend.",0
"I have had this for two years now. I have three Siberian huskies and needed something to protect the new suv's cargo area.

It has held up really, really well! It still looks brand new after I vacuum it out at the end of Furmageddon Season.

As other customers have noted, the adhesive hook and loop strips supplied are disappointing. The glue detached from the vinyl interior wall of the cargo area after a few hot summer days, but the rest of the cover was so well made I didn't mind finding alternate ways to attach it.

The only thing I would like improved other than the side attachment strips is the straps that go around the seat rest in front are a little short and took some careful maneuvering to set right.",1
I need to practice but actually got this working after only a few tries. It's tricky but not impossible and there are a great many videos on how to use it. Now if I could get my dog to do what she's supposed to be doing we'll be all set. She's just a puppy yet but coming along.,1
"Worked great and looked seamless with the rest of the sliding glass door and didn't look cheap. Easily adjustable in height.  Only downside is figuring out how to weather seal the seam where the insert aligns to the original sliding glass door.  Had to remove it because we were getting too many scorpions in the house, but for the average use I'd highly recommend.",1
"This is good dog food.  It's not as inexpensive as Petco, but since Petco has stopped shipping to APO's, we don't have many options.",1
"Easily installed, works great.",1
Comfortable for my dogs.,1
My cat thinks it's delicious.,1
"Honestly, these shouldn't cost this much. They work, which is why I gave them 2 stars, but they should cost no more than $5.",0
"Product was lacking a reasonable amount of freshness. Product was VERY stale upon receipt, even the dog can tell the difference.",0
"Filmsy, showed up with parts missing.",0
This product is awful!  It frays and it's mess. Looks like they cut this from a large piece and the grass just falls off everywhere. Everytime you move it the grass keeps falling off.,0
We love this litterbox! Only problem is occasionally the auger gets stuck but a simple cleaning remedies the situation. If we keep the litter at the proper level it works great!,1
"My dog was having many allergy and skin issues. She had been on and off of steriods for almost 6 months.  Not only does she love this food, but she is finally off of the steriods!",1
"Bar none, this is the best food for goldfish.  It is also excellent for characins and for saltwater fish that need a degree of vegetable intake, such as surgeon fish.",1
"I saw all the glowing reviews and purchased this right away.  It IS a thick sturdy item and for that reason alone I am giving it more than one star.  I just don't know where all these other reviewers live who are giving it 4 and 5 stars.  We were never able to screw this into the ground.  Tried several locations and after about four inches it just wouldn't screw in any further.  And we had very very strong people trying.  So perhaps we have solid rock under our lawn and garden in which case I would be judging this unfairly.  However, I bought a competitors brand and it screwed right down and sits almost flush with the earth so I am guessing rock foundation is not the problem.",0
Adorable!  Love these collars.  Good quality!,1
"My retriever usually shreds a toy in 3.2 minutes.  This toy amused her for 3 hours today, with no signs of damage.  Happy dog and happy owner.",1
"Not even one star, this is a joke to me they send me a bag that is EMPTY!!!",0
haven't really figured out what this strap is for. This order came with a car seat adapter which works fantastic. Now I cn drive more safely other than having my pooch sitting on my chest which isn't safe for either him or me.,1
Product didn't work as expected,0
"This is so cute! I have two cats, and I have each of their food bowls, which I love, so of course, I had to get their water bowl. I got it so that I could put tooth additives in it to protect them from plaque and gingivitis and the like. The cats seem to like drinking out of it, so I'm happy they are drinking more and protecting their teeth.",1
"Big,clunky and I would not put it on a horse.  The item suggested to by with the anti-bark collar was two batteries.  Bought these and they did not even fit the collar.",0
"This product did not work on my 3 cats, waste of $$",0
"At times many of us are desperate for relief from a disruptive life situation.  We may have a physical disorder, are aging, or have a neighbor with barking dogs.  Realistically, we know that there is no solution to our problem but we buy the untested pills, ointments, and devices because we are desperate for a solution.  This device falls into the category of, ""it is cheap and it just might work.""  However, as with pills that promise to give you youth and energy, creams that magically erase wrinkles, oils that give hope of relief from arthritus,  the only thing this device delivers is the same depressing thoughts I have had after buying and using other such ineffective products.",0
The item was exactly as expected. It was the exact measurements and is perfect for our dogs needs. I recommend it.,1
"My dog would eat it only if she was really hungry. When I switched her to another brand, I planned to gradually change her over to the new dog food by introducing a portion at a time... Well, when I put the new food in, she would eat the new stuff and leave HSD. I had no major issues with HSD except for I felt my Dog had itchy skin and she gained weight.",0
I must tell you that this product is exactly as advertised.  My fish are greatly enjoying the warmth it provides.  Easy to install,1
"My dog turn nose up at this, but is somewhat of a picky eater, family sometimes gives scraps so more our fault than anything. smells kinda like the dried ramen.",0
"Filter was a problem for my betta. It stressed her out badly, I think the flow was a bit much for her. The tank size is good, I like that the light moves up and out of the way, but overall it feels cheaply made. Filter is loud and the top closure hatch broke immediately (first use). I like that it has a raised section and platform below, but there are too many wires to deal with especially when you add another for a heater. Feeding hole works well. I bought this tank for the bigger size (a plus) and the filter (a failure for me). So-so overall. Keeping it because I like the size for my solo female betta.",0
"I tried to used it a training tool (as recommended by my Vet) and it didn't work! Probably to scare streets dogs maybe, but I would not recommend it if your main purpose is to train your puppy!",0
"This rating is from my cats:  ""We don't care for it. It would have been nicer if it crinkled.""",0
Oddly one of my dogs favorite treats. Great price and great shipping. I've ordered several times now.,1
Instructions are very complicated and dosage is more than I wanted to do.,0
"Superior at controlling urine odor but the open design allows for awful feces odor. And if you have a dog in the house, beware, our Dachshund used this litter box as his personal cat poop buffet, and then would vomit the poop the next day. 

And the system is very expensive to maintain. For the cost of pads and pellets, you could pay for a self cleaning electronic litter box in a matter of months.",0
The dogs seem to love the taste of this!,1
"I got this for my 10 year old golden retriever who is not the most active thing around but has her share of biting and chewing on things.  She did not like this toy one bit.  She pretty much stared at it and ignored it.  I also have two cats who like to chew on things.  However, they weren't impressed either.  Needless to say, this is being returned.  It does look pretty sturdy in my opinion.  It would be good for a dog who likes to play a little rough once you've established that he/she likes the toy to begin with.",0
Totally stained my carpet.  I read the reviews before I purchased it and thought I would be okay.  I have a carpet cleaner here right now working on the 16 paw prints on the carpet.  I used it once and will be throwing it away.,0
The dog lives them to bad they are so expensive,1
This item Was the wrong size. I asked for a tea cup size for a small dog. This is  not what I thought it was. I will rate this item zero.,0
Really working well to curb cat clawing furniture.,1
"In short, my 17 old cat just completely ignores it, and 7-year old cat just barely notices there is some sound but it does not prevent him to do what he intended to do. Wasted money!",0
"These bags worked great until I got through about 100 of them, then the remaining bags on the roll were so biodegradable that each of the remaining would be torn/ripped already, or would tear/rip as you pulled them off the roll. I would avoid this product overall or avoid the larger 300 count roll.",0
"Nice, got it for my granddaughters horse, larger for a quarter horse",1
This is a great replacement for the real thing!,1
It was received with the bottom plastic  pan cracked.,0
Piece of junk. Don't waste your money. My dog tore it the first time she rode in a car with it attached.,0
We used this in a goldfish bowl for a beta. When we came back two days later the water was completely clouded and nasty with a film on top.,0
"Best purchase I ever made for my 2 pups. No tangles, comfy handle, easy to jog with when you put the loop on your elbow! Best leash on the market and at an awesome price!",1
Easy to assemble and exactly as expected.  Nice Dog House,1
"It quit working during the first use, those things happen, returned it and ordered the next one better.",0
"Cleans well, I will use it again. Its a crumbly product and you should run the vaccum a few times over it for a clean look
Shipping was fast and easy",1
"I purchased this Flea and Tick control for my cats. I did as instructed, sprayed each cat on the back of the neck one time. I waited overnight, saw no discomfort. The next day, I sprayed each cat three times down their back, trying to  keep the spray confined to the back of their shoulders so they wouldn't lick so much. I skipped a day, did it again, skipped a day, did it again. By night that third application my cats were throwing up. Both of them. The next day, the diarrhea started. My two lovely cats who never once had an accident, suddenly were unable to make it to their litter pan. Top floor. Bottom floor. There was no place safe. I took it to them to the vet, and after $400 in vet bills and $100 in carpet shampoo bills, I can say that my cats have recovered. They were both very sick, and the vet said that we were lucky and stopped it in time, that they both could have been facing liver damage from the oils in the product. Without a doubt this product made them sick.

I followed all the directions on the label and website. The website reads: ""THESE ARE NOT TOXICITY RESPONSES, as Wondercide Flea & Tick Control for Pets + Home is an all-natural, phenol-free product. "" But this is completely misleading. Of course natural products can lead to a Toxicity response. I don't know if it's safe on other cats or just my cats had a reaction, but I do have two cats that aren't related, one is only 18 months old, and both of them got sick. Wondercide needs to be more responsible about the real danger this can present.",0
Literally stopped my dog from all barking within two days of first use.  Wow!,1
Works great on my golden-doodle's coat! He looks like he just came from the groomers.,1
"I was skeptical, but these really work.
If we miss a day on giving our Border Collar his greenie... his arthris is horrible.
Since we started these... no hip pro lens at all!!!
We LOVE this product and so does our baby  boy!!",1
best thing I have bought!,1
":( I'm very sad. I used to order these worms every few months for a long time and they always came perfectly. This time though, around 50% of them came dead and when I opened the box it smelled horribly of rotten worms. I don't know why this happened only this time, but I would still recommend this company because the other times I have ordered it was great.",0
No problems! Good purchase.,1
The cats love the plush toy but the string lasted 20 minutes.  I expected better from Kong.  Cats are still playing with the toy but the stick and string are useless.,0
Tilda is a happy tortoise!,1
The size of the kibble is HUGE.  It's more the size for a medium to large sized DOG than a cat.  My cat literally is starving himself refusing to eat it.  This brand of canned food has my cat's stamp of approval.,0
"My betta loves the balls. I broke one apart and rubbed it into a ball and created three instead of two! They survive water changes never needs rinsed or disturbed when changing water, they adapt. I use these in a 1/2 gallon betta tank along with a betta heater that is plugged into a light dimmer to regulate my heater. But all do very well in my small eco betta tank! Oh, I also have a betta leaf hammock on the side of the tank! they all work well not over crowded.",1
not as appeared is photo,0
Great cat toy with robust components.  My rather destructive cats are not able to break this one.,1
"Not for long dogs like a  dachound or cat, otherwise so adorable",1
Cat looks great in it,1
"I had hoped these Kong toys would stand up to my cocker spaniel, but they didn't. The purple octopus lasted 15 minutes. The green tug rope lasted less than ten after he managed to get it away from me and race across the yard with it. The balls were destroyed almost immediately. The hard plastic toys are still going and he loves them, although the squeaker bone is beginning to show chew marks. The price is great, but they really won't stand up to a chewer.",0
Works well. Does the job.,1
My dog liked these treats so I was happy with them.,1
"this Bottom's up leash is the worst thing possible . It won't seat right no matter how much you adjust it , and you can only tight it up so much before you make the dog very uncomfortable. My dog , a german shephard of 90 lb has problem standing for long and he cannnot use his back legs to walk without assistance so we did get a wheelchair but for just outside duties and inside moving around we needed some support
This thing is very poorly designed , it almost like suspending the dogs legs without giving any real support for him to try moving his own legs which he can do a little bit with other type of harnnesses
It is very expensive and doesn't provide what is intended to , support
If you leave it too loose will slip off the legs while the dog is trying to move and if it is too tight will become like a strap for you to carry the whole weight of the dog around. Not to mention that when the dog is resting the  harness is somewhere on the floor as there is no way that will stay where is supposed to , up his legs and bottom .  And by the time you put it back on him and adjust it so it won't catch his legs in the wrong way you can wind up with an accident in the house
You are better off with a scarf or a towell than this harness
 Do not waste your money on it",0
I have fed this dog food for years. One dog lived to 15 years old and my other dog is 14 years old. I would recommend this product.,1
My Peaches loves this deluxe food.  :-),1
Excellent my dog loves it,1
It looked cute on the dog. But did not do the job. A waste of funds.,0
I purchased these when my older spaniel could barely walk. His hind legs were dragging and his front legs were getting weak. He loves them; he thinks he is getting a treat. His mobility has improved so much that he is running and jumping again. I recommend them to everyone.,1
Yes. it sure did. My both of my kitten just love it.  Thanks,1
"Being a professional groomer now for over 15 years I can honestly say these are by far the best clippers around.  Expensive yes, but if you are a professional groomer, well worth the money.  I started out with the larger Laube clippers (standard sized 7 or 7.5 inches long) then got the Laube Mini.  I've had the same clipper now for approximately 12 years with never a problem.  I just recently replaced the cord pack but have never had a problem with the clippers itself.  Not only are they super light weight and never get hot in your hand; what I love most about the Mini is the size.  It allows you to get under the dog and do tummy shaves, arm pit shaves and other under the body work with total ease.  With older dogs that can't stand on their hind feet very well or for long, it is a god-send.  I won't even consider standard sized clippers anymore. I could never go back.  On occasion I have used my old Laubes and do not like the added length.  It is bulky and cumbersome after using the little Mini.  Full of power, light weight and easy to use.  Also the design is easily held in your hand unlike clippers that are the same width the whole length of the clipper.  I can't really recommend THIS clipper as I'm still using my 12 or 13 year+ Laube Mini.  It has no light and is pink ... probably haven't made that color in years but ... it's still running like a champ and if the company still makes the same quality as they did back then I would think you'd be very happy with this product.  I know if my Mini's ever meet the doggie boneyard ...I will be back for my new Laube's and bite the bullet on the price.  As usual - you get what you pay for.  Once you hold these and work with them you will never go back to a ""traditional"" clippers again.",1
"I received this item with very little instruction, however did manage to be able to put item together. After completing the task, there were no place to attach the harness to the wheel base?? And what I thought were attachments, did not secure the wheel base, as it slid out whenever I placed on my pet. Was a total waste of money!",0
Works great,1
I'll be buying more. The dogs love it,1
Miracle powder... My dog was laid up and we thought we would have to put her down.  Two weeks of powder and she is back to her normal self.,1
"Thought I would give to our granddog - when I received, they are coated in a brown something or other.  Won't give to the dog because I don't want the brown stuff staining my rugs.",0
"Excellent product, easy to feed.  Arrived when promised.  Noticed results within 3-4 days!  My 17 yr old cat, who insisted on being an outdoor cat nearly her whole life, was otherwise healthy and happy but her joints have declined in the past few months.  I wanted a natural supplement to help her that was easy to give and would show results.  I have not been disappointed.  She transitioned from docile and walking poorly, to surprisingly feisty with increased activity and an improved gait.  Of course a supplement won't fix structural damage in bones and joints from years of adventurous living but can certainly improve them and the quality of life for an old animal.  I would certainly recommend this product for a cat that needs a skip in it's step again!  It's a conservative, relatively inexpensive way to help an old friend.",1
"my cat loves these, and he is very picky.",1
Fun puppy loves it. :-),1
Perfect for what I wanted it for,1

"Purchased this brand at a local store on sale for $7.  Waste of money.  After talking with several other friends who bought this brand, the problem appears to be inconsistent quality in a tool that was made for someone only putting together a couple of cages.

When it works, it's great - for a limited time until the joint loosens or the metal itself bends.  Mine came with a loose joint as did those of several other folks.

For what you get, this is overpriced.  Buy better quality.",0
The plastic gate ripped within a few months.,0

"Like many others, the motor just quit working.  Now I have an expensive, hard to clean bowl that doesn't filter :(",0
"Received the pet playpen, that I requested to be shipped in unmarked box due to gift, and it was shipped in original box. I tried to set it up anyway, and upon screwing in screws, one of the sides cracked, as it was difficult to screw in. Think I'll start shopping elsewhere.",0
High dollar looking collar! I like!,1
"It smells horrible. "" Animal health "" all right but it makes me(animal) sick.",0
Definitelty high quality cat food at a reasonable price. My cat loves it and his fur looks more shiney since using this regularly.,1
"Love this mat! It works great, catches all the litter and easy clean up. It's smaller than I thought, but still big enough",1
"DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE CATS! Or a large dog that can reach it. Even on a hard, flat surface, this thing is not durable. This cage led to the demise of my hamster... I'd strongly recommend a 10g glass tank with a sturdy cage topper. (for extra space for a larger hamster to roam).",0
"Our dog simply loved this toy and all he wanted to do was carry it everywhere and squeak it. He's not the type to abuse it either. Imagine your favorite pet just wanting to squeak a squeaky toy? It happens!
Just more Chinese crap. I think his next toy will be a craftsman lifetime wrench or something.",0
This didn't work at all.  I put it on my dog's paws to keep her from licking.  It did not even deter her at all.  She licked the stuff off.,0
Bought for my puppy but haven't got her yet!,1

"This is my cat favorite wet food. I always buy this brand canned food. I do looked around where the canned food for cats cheaper. No where else than Amazon. By far, Amazon is the ONLY one place to buy cat food.",1
"I'm giving this toy's educational value five stars. I've learned more in Georgia. Sometimes value is reflected in how we learn not to act. The dog died because I let her run free. There was no escape, and no run. No run that we were captives to an action. A service entrance left the dog loose. The dog's being loose -- lack of smell - meant I was unable to give it meat. Nutrition was usually left outside the service entrance. The dog went through the entry, changing its name. A truck then came at very fast paces. I wanted to run and tell my momma on ya'll. I broke. Time till entry? She was a yelper. I was given a few seconds with the pile. Puddled, our interaction lacked a fluid. I soon pupped and found pain was involved. My fault, crazy at the end and leashed - air being left in a flat to sour - lay down to perform the angel in creamed corn I would not be hungry enough to eat.",0
Perfect size foe conure or Hahns macaw,1
"I found this product at pet smart. I was devestated when they stopped selling this product. My cat was looking forward for her treat in the morning. My cat loves it and
I wish you would put it back in the pet stores again in Canada.",1
"Gave my dog horrible dandruff and didn't remedy the mild hair loss on top of her head. I ended up using coconut oil (raw, unfiltered from grocery store) on her skin and in her food, as well as Fish oil to make her skin and coat soft again.",0

Works great!,1
These pellets tend to stick.  Constant adjustment is needed.  The film it gives off is horrible,0
It's not silent at all.,0
"Got this for our Shelie.  Perfect.  Mainly just using it to stop it getting urine in the car when we go on long trips.  He'll just urinate in that and it didn't leak on the car at all.  Was well worth the money.  If you're tired of your pet peeing on stuff or pottie training them, this is a great item!  Great quality too!",1
"I am a bird lover. I prefer Finch and Cockatiel, we have had a budge parrot as well(not as friendly). Over the last 12 years I have had two (Vet confirmed) birds die from digestive complications where the vet found the rope material caused a digestive block or failure. I would never put a rope in a habitat with a bird as it can cause illness or death.",0
Each time my dog was fed this food she got a horrible case of diarrhea. I will not purchase this food again very upset with how sick my dog got.,0
All Dr Tim's products are great including this one. I use this in all my tanks on every water change.,1
Scale is perfect!,1
"Great idea but didn't work! When I put the battery in the device sounded once, then a second time then vibrated. I thought it was working so I placed it on my dog, and when he barked the device didn't do anything. I bought it based on that it is humane but it just isn't there yet.",0
"too clumsy my 4lb Yourke keeped coming out of it

"I have a cat with UT issues and so I thought these would be a good fit for him. Unfortunately I also thought I'd save myself time and trouble and I ordered 3 bags of these all at once. Big mistake. Not one of my cats will eat them. When I toss one down to the floor, they walk over expecting to get a treat, take one sniff and walk away. I've so far tried them out on five different cats and none of them have eaten the treats. Perhaps the racoons will eat them once I send them to the compost pile.",0

"My dogs love these biscuits, but unfortunately my local grocery store and Target stores no longer carry them.  I'm very happy that they are available on Amazon.  Highly recommend them.",1
"Unfortunately, I open the packed after a couple of months of delivery to put it in my car and realized that the seat cover doesn't come with any opening for seat belt buckling. This is a major flaw, not sure how this is not noticed or product manufacturer hasn't seen it. Now give its some time I cant even return the product and I will have either to keep it in my garage for no use or cut holes for seat belts and then use it. Either case I feel my $27 is gone waste.",0
Used it once and never again. My pets didn't enjoy the experience.,0
Great item the cats love it,1
Lasted about two hours.,0
Great product ... bought 4 of them as water bowls for my 5 indoor cats. Have them spaced throughout the house and my cats use them all.,1
"Each one matches the harness, highly reflective, and long for roaming around.",1
Great product,1
Exactly as pictured. Thanks!,1
"I love this house for my chinchilla! There's so much room and I was able to add so many toys and little houses. I do wish I would have bought the ferret habitat instead though, because I like the bars a little wider, so I can pet her through the bars.",1
I bought 2 BarksBar front seat covers for my 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan. They fit perfectly!  The quilted material is high quality. These covers stay in place and do not slide off. They are very easy to install. I would definitely recommend them!,1
Our 4 cats love it!,1
Love it,0
Woof woof.... Bark bark bark... Squirrel!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm a good boy????? Yes I wanna go outside and bark at the trees!!!!! Woof woof woof bark bark bark growl squeak squeak......( I think my dog was trying to say he loves this new toy),1
"This unit randomly shocks the dog, warning beeper is so quiet the dog can't hear the warning.",0
"My two dogs love the hide-a-squirrel toy! My terrier digs them all out of the tree, and then my chihuahua steals the squirrels one by one and puts them in his bed. It is a riot! When I leave the toy out, they seem less interested in it. So after they've had their fill, I put all the squirrels back in their tree and put it away. When I get it out the next time, they go bisserk! I think the key (at least for us) is using it as an intermittent activity. It keeps them excited and interested. It also keeps my terrier from destroying the squeakers while I'm away. Overall fantastic toy and great price.",1
"It simply does not work. My pup will bark loudly and nothing happens. It is appropriately fitted, as stated in the enclosed instructions, but fails to produce the result promised.",0
"Mu beta kept leaning against the filter and his fins were looking really ragged.  I have this in the tank and he leans against it and goes in it too.  Even the cherry shrimp like to hang out on and in this.  I am thinking of getting one for my 55 gallon tank.  Maybe a medium one for my male and female beta, and the dojo loaches.",1
Make sure you get the right size. It takes a few days but works like a charm. Its been several months and tank is still clear. Highly recommended.,1
"Stays put, but fell apart",0
Product is totally misrepresented in the photo.  Color is not at all as shown and we strongly dislike it.,0
"When I received these I was happy they were going to fit my dogs speciality crate. The first one I put on was a little tough, when I went to unscrew the second one the wingnut broke off with my fingers. So I grabbed a pair of pliers and worked for awhile getting the broken piece off because it was painted on there. My husband and I were getting ready to fly from Germany back to the states so we couldn't just order a new one and hope it makes it in time. We got it on the crate, flew from Germany to Georgia non stop, go to get our dog and the bowls were lying on the ground and the pieces that hold the bowls were in the back of the crate. I wouldn't recommend these for long flights or any flight. Your animal could be injured.",0
cat's would not drink water and it left sticky residue in bowl....making my cleaning more a hassle.,0
Piece of junk. Should not be marketed to the consumer for home installation or anyone else for that matter every thing about it is cheap cheap cheap should I say it again. I am super handy and this thing took me several hours with all the right tools. Why would anyone want to cut screws to length glue unfitting plastic to the frames tape pieces together and cut plastic strip to the proper width just to put a cat door together that when you do get it together it still doesn't fit right. I too should have listened to the reviews because every thing said about this piece of junk are true. I bought the regular cat one yesterday and had it together in under an hour but decided I needed the bigger one this took 3-4 hrs of frustration trying to engineer out all there screw ups. If you call them they will tell you to watch the video on youtube I say if you need to watch a video to put a cat door together you shouldn't be selling it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,0
"Our cat loves this brand.  We love these treats because she has to eat special cat food since her stomach makes ""crystals"" and requires a fish free food.  Note, domesticated cats are not naturally born to eat fish.  We love the beef and catnip since it does not have high mercury.",1
My cats love this food.,1
"Nice vest, very sturdy ring, great fit and reflective too!",1
It doesn't work it acts as tho the scissors  are bent and I paid 38.00 dollars for something i cannot use a waste of my money,0
Dog loves it,1
Great treats for a great price.,1
Arrived as promised. Bentley our pet dog loves it.,1
Survived my Great Danes!,1
This toy claims to be durability 7. What a joke. This lasted for 2 day's. Very disappointed.,0
cans were dented,0
"I can't figure out the sizing for these harnesses.  The S is too big, the XS is too small.",0
Perfect for our small cat.  Needed a second carrier and had it in plenty of time for the vet trip.  Took no time to put together and so easy to take apart to clean,1
Too small for my dog.,0
I've had for over a week and my 4 cats love the rug they were on it immediately.  My dominate male cat chased everyone off.  They love hiding/playing on it. One cat scratches on it and so far no damage.,1
Exactly as described. Enough seeds for 1.5 times the soil given so I planted some in a second tray. The instructions are clear and very effective. Sprouted literally overnight and growing by as much as an inch per day. Cat loves it,1
"this product has de imagen wrong. this isn't be the image I saw on the website when I made the purchase.. and all the seller say is:

Carlos,

The black compartments that you are speaking of with the filter wheels are for the other model I had mentioned before. The Magnum 350 Pro has the added bio-wheel option; this is not what you have ordered. The Magnum with the added bio-wheel to make it a Pro version is also extra money.

I hope this helps to clarify, any other questions let me know.

hello Jessica,

this is the image I saw on the website when I made the purchase..

As you can see in the small box in blue this is the part I did not received..
don't get me wrong, I got the filter along with everything else, the blue thing and the charcoal, I even got the black thing inside of this box shape item, all of them have a
what I don't have is the big black thing that you put the filter inside of .

Carlos,

Thank you for getting back to me, I am sorry to say no one here speaks Spanish.

I'm not sure what picture you are seeing, I have checked Amazon and our Web site to see what picture we show and I do not see anything extra included in the picture that would look to be black.

Did you happen to see the other model that has the bio wheels on a different picture?

There are two models available, the one you purchased ML Magnum 350 and then there is the ML Magnum 350 Pro. The other series that includes a bio wheel would be the H.O.T series. I hope this helps to clear anything up, let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you in advance",0
"I bought an aqua colored leash for a 10lb pup. (I forget the size but it was 1-size-up from her suggested weight size) So obviously it was strong enough to hold her. It's a good length to give dog fair walking room, the clip is sturdy & fits together perfectly, no slip spots-it clips onto collar or vest very well without seperation. I'd recommend Also color was nice clear & bright.",1
"Cute designs, but the sizing charts are WAAAY off!  Following some of the other reviews, I ordered LARGE for my small Maltese and they were still too small!  Now I have to go through the trouble of sending them back and getting a larger size.  I was really looking forward to using the bands on my dogs.",0
Both my cats love this. I wanted to find something a little better nutrition wise than fancy feast. This is going to be my go to treat meal for my cats. they love every flavor especially the blue and pink cans :). I even sent this to my sister and mom in Virginia who have cats as well and they devoured every last bit. It is a little expensive but well worth in my opinion for a treat meal every other day. :),1
"It was delivered two weeks past the best by date! The product was delivered on November 7, 2017 and the expiration date on the package is October 10,2017. It can be harmful to the pets health, very irresponsible.",0
my critters love it,1
This one has very large chunks of husk in it.,0
The dogs like them.  I don't know if they are working though.,1
"I purchased two of these collars for my barking corgis.  They have curtailed their barking.  I only put them on them in the morning when I get up, this is when they get super excited for their breakfast.  They get out one bark and then they are done.  I highly recommend this product.",1
My lab is 7 years old and plays frisbee on the daily. She started limping more and more noticeably after playing. Started her on this stuff with recommendation of our Vet. Worked within a month. Shes not limping anymore and still as active as ever.,1
I can't imagine this holding up on any active dog.  It broke before we even got it on the dog. Never had a chance to try it.,0
Use this to brush my dog's teeth with once a day. He doesn't seem to mind it and his teeth stay nice and clean.,1
"While they are cute- they are extremely small. I own a high volume mobile grooming company and there are very few dogs that we groom that these will work on. The dimensions are posted in the details (shame on me) but the picture shown is extremely misleading to their size. Also, one came with no back clip at all (so I couldn't even glue it back on.)",0
My bare eyed cockatoo has not been able to destroy this toy within minutes like so many others that have come and gone.,1
"Like other reviewers stated, the bottom is only held in place with several 1 inch Velcro pieces. Not secure at all and no way would I leave my puppy in it because escape would be inevitable. Returned item.",0
"My cat was extremely lethargic for a couple days after applying the product, almost like he overdosed from the medicine. I don't usually write reviews, but wanted customers to have a heads up bc it was very disturbing to see his reaction to the meds.",0
"These hoodies are wonderful for my two girls, (Boston Terriers).  Well made, soft, easy to get on and off.  I will be ordering from you guys again.  Thanks",1
"My Pups collar finally arrived today from China. However, the Rhinestone pups name and charms are MIA! The only reason why I purchased this collar was for the fancy rhinestone name and charms! Only received a simple plain pink collar! Ugh!",0
"I bought this in the hopes of finding urine spots from my cat who is behaving badly.  It is pocket size small, but gives off a good amount of light.  I like it because it does clearly show old urine spots on the carpet.  What I don't like is that it does not show urine on my hardwood floors and does not show new spots (granted I can see the new spots without the light).  If you have an old spot that is causing an odor or can't find a spot, I think it is a good buy.",1
Perfect for my dog and easy to clean and maintain.,1
"This product works when other brands stopped working altogether. We use it monthly. To save money, I buy the extra large dog vials and dump the contents into a small container, then extract the exact amount needed for one dose using a simple plastic syringe.",1
I can see a difference in my dog's issue with climbing stairs.,1
"Fast delivery,  easy to use and good quality",1
"DO NOT BUY, Returning to manufacturer, possible fradulant product.  Has an unusual perfumed scent, this is NOT normal.",0
"Love these treats! My ten year old husky is super picky, but he adores th flavor of these. He even picks them
Out of his food and saves them for last, like a dessert. They have also helped his joints a ton, especially in the winter! I tried a couple of other products, but always end up Back with these",1
I loved the idea of these since I change my dogs collar somewhat frequently but they did not hold up very well. The clip part seems to break pretty easily.,0
Our dogs loved them but then I read the ingredients label and the fourth-largest ingredient is sugar!!  How terrible for their dental health.  Can't believe these are sold as a healthful dog treat.,0
I bought two dresses for my puppies. The bows came off right away. One of the dresses the bow was off of it out of the package.  Not happy with it at all.,0
"I purchased this litter box in November of 2015 and it is now April of 2016 and it is completely dead and has been for several weeks.

I have two cats who are medium size and are indoor/outdoor cats. Their use of the litter box isn't frequent but with two, I figured I would like to have the convenience of a self cleaning box. In February I noticed the box wasn't cleaning as quickly as it used to and by the beginning of April it was fried and completely useless.

For $30 bucks I could say this was well worth my money, but for $80+, it's an absolute ripoff.",0
"I have had this product for only 7 months and it has already stopped working. With my lights all working properly, the controller turns on but does not give any power to the lights. Would not recommend if looking for somethings that will last the life of your pet.",0
Did not help my pet at all.  :(,0
"A quality product that my English Bulldogs enjoy and thrive upon.  Excellent dietary results in regards to allegeries and overall health, a product truthfully advertised.",1
Good Quality for an awesome price,1
My dog does not care for these.,0
Just will not work with the dogs collar.,0
My 6 month old springer puppy had the rope chewed in half in less than an hour.  On the other hand it gave me one hour of peace and quiet.,0
A bit small,1
broke quick....,0
"I've ordered the large split elk antler and it was wonderful, but the large whole antler is incredibly disappointing. It is about half the size of the split antler and more money. I hesitate even giving it to my dog because it's so small.",0
our dog Maggie loves his little bones that have red running through it. I think it is chicken. She eats the red first and then slowly choose on the rest of the bone. She's a Pug-Zu so her mouth isn'tvery big and this is just the right size.,1
never worked,0
My golden/lab mix  and my cocker spaniel both had it's head and feet ripped off in a day or two,0
"Dogs hear it, then are deterred for 5 minutes, until they resume the barking.  Then they have learned to ignore it. The thing must be left on and it eats batteries nonstop Of course they are the expensive D batteries, too.",0
this bed is terrible!  small and thin.  took forever to get here.  and now they want me to pay the return shipping.  I don't think so.  in the process of trying to get a refund now.,0
The day I got this we played and it came apart right away.  No way to fix it either.  JUNK!!,0
Bought the wrong product,0
The dogs liked them!,1
"This scat mat is a very good way to train dogs and cats to stay off beds, furniture, etc. The mat is made from a sturdy plastic with embedded wiring.  This unit is a replacement for one that was borrowed and not returned. They are well made and will last a good long while if not walked on or folded or treated in other ways that would cause the wires to break. I am quite happy with the purchase.",1
"Say that ten times fast!

Anyway, we adopted a little feral kitten. He brought in a few fleas. So, we dosed them all with this stuff and Flea Free!",1
We've had this for about 6 months and it's falling apart. My cats can't go up to the highest ledges anymore as they are completely unstable. I fully expected it to last a bit longer than this. I wouldn't recommend this at all.,0
"We have several kitties, and some of them are kind of huge.  This is not a large cat tree, but it still will hold 3 cats.  Our Maine Coon (who is small for an MC - he's 14 lbs) loves the little house on top.

This is pretty cute, but it's not as easy to clean as it should be considering cats like to hork up hairballs unexpectedly.  The screws that hold the ""trunks"" in place are open to the air, so they can get goop inside.  I'm not entirely sure how easy this is to clean - I'm used to carpet and this is kind of like velour.  It feels great now though.  I'm not sure how it's going to feel after cleaning vomit off of it a few times.

This seems to be pretty sturdy.  The kitties have explored it quite thoroughly and haven't knocked it down yet.

This is fairly easy to put together.  I did it by myself in about half an hour.  The top two bits (the house & stand) went together very easily.  getting the main (bottom) trunk attached to the two floors was a little harder.  It would have been easier with another person holding the pieces together while I screwed the bits together.  But I made it, darn it!  The instructions were easy to follow.

This is good!  It's probably best if you have smaller cats, but since big cats like little boxes, it works OK for big cats as well.

Though to be perfectly honest, the kitties were absolutely delighted with the box it came in.",1
"I purchased this claw clipper to trim the nails of my two Bengal cats.  Both are pretty good about having their nails clipped especially if I get them when they are sleepy.  Neither one enjoys it but they don't bite or try and claw my face off either.  I like this style of clipper because you can see the quick easily (so no accidentally cutting the claws too short).  I also like this clipper because it does not crush or flatten the nail in the trimming process.  All around great product.  Happy cats, happy life!

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.",1
Cat liked it a lot.,1

Maybe it was because it was a gift for me on Fathers Day from my son. Product was broken in 3 pieces.",0
My kitten goes crazy for these!!! Most of them end up under the fridge and oven though haha great buy!,1
Keeps our pups busy and slows them down because we use this as a feeder. We don't have highly destructive chewers so it's perfect for our household.,1
"I could see how this would be fun for a dog, but my dog had the seams ripped up in less than 10 minutes.  He is a little destroyer of toys, but even $1 Wal-Mart toys usually last him longer than that.  For the price, I just thought that it would stand up a bit longer.",0
Perfect!!!,1
It lasted about a minute before it fell apart. Not much of a chew toy. They need to use better glue to put these things together.,0
"Not what I expected but my dogs love love love them. I have 2 small dogs. My one dog at first was not too sure about this food, I think it was a texture issue. But once she figure it out she loved this food. I read that others added water, didn't try it but I am sure it would have helped. My cat, who is extremely picky, love this food as well. Yes, it is on the expensive side, but it is sooooo worth it.",1
"I hate giving this toy one star, but if you are like me, you read one-star reviews to figure out why you should NOT purchase something. I gave this to my sister's Yorkie for xmas because my pug LOVES these hide and seek toys. Even though this one a a pretty small toy, her Yorkie's head goes all the way through the hidey hole and gets stuck in there. I felt terrible about that so I took it back and gave it to by big-headed pug. Now i owe her baby another toy.",0
It has a nice design and good quality. It has two textures that will keep the puppy or dog interested.,1
"My dogs have puppias that they have had for a few years. My smaller dogs is a small & my other dogs was a med. I ordered new ones and I feel the sizing has changed. The small was no where close to even going over my small dogs head, so he had to take the med & we returned the small for a Large for my dog that normally takes a med. I love Puppias but feel sizing has changed.",0
my degus chewed thru the plastic bottom in no time.was disappointed about this but the cage itself is a very nice cage for a non chewing animal,0
Best litter system ever!  We've used it for years.  Works effectively to eliminate odors.  Easy to clean.  Hygenic.  Great value with budget friendly operating costs.,1
"This is a great soft chew toy for dogs that are not power chewers. My Redshirt unfortunately met an untimely death from my dog's teeth. Will work quite nicely for light chewers & tuggers. If your dog tends to rip soft toys easily, I would recommend something sturdier.",1
First time I ever put a hutch together and I had no trouble because the instructions were very easy and simple. Definitely good for the price. Best suited for dwarf rabbits. Has seperate room inside for rabbit to hide; which is an absolute necessity.,1
Perfect size for my shih tzu. Holds well on cage. Love the removable bowls.,1
Works great for our sugar babies. I have bought this several times and will continue to buy.,1
"Always a great product. This is by far my favorite salt mix on the market.
On top of that, Shipping always seems to arrive quickly.",1
fast shipping great quality highly recommend,1
Two cats and a small dog would not drink from this PetSafe Drinkwell 360 Pet Fountain no matter how much I encouraged them.  I wanted to return this but an unreasonably short return period forced me to lose the $30+ I paid for this unusable device.  To get even I will buy books from sources other than Amazon.com for several months or years.  Not a happy customer.,0
"This charmer was one of my cat's favorite toys, especially on cold winter days when he didn't want to go outside.",1
Horrible. Pins fall out after one wash. Pins will be in your hand or pets body.,0
Daisy my 10 yr old cat seems to like this product so I will continue to buy it for her.,1
"My Yukon is finally ""Jule"" proof.  The cover means she can't hurt the leather seats.  I have a cover between the seats so she can't get into the front seat and the child lock is on so she can't put the windows down.  She's half german shepherd and half grayhound.  This cover is the best I have ever had because it fits and stays put, even with a four legged child.",1
Purchased for daughter's boyfriends cat.  Is working wonderfully as I knew it would as my dog also has one.,1
This item was put together very poorly. You can see bare wood. Never buting from this place again. Wal-mart has better furniture. It was also cheaper there.,0
Shortly after receiving this collar I started having problems turning it on.  After a few months it wouldn't turn on at all.  The vendor replaced the unit fairly promptly.  The new one worked well for a few weeks.  After a fetching session involving chasing a ball into a lake it started working erratically and then stopped working all together.  My guess is this unit will only withstand a limited exposure to water.  I'm going to be buying another brand.  I think even if the vendor would replace this second unit it would be a waste of my money to send it back given how much my dog loves the water.,0
Works good....because of size it is a little difficult to reach all areas. If your buying it for the hair release button...DONT. Mine doesnt work.,0
Very small. Very cheap.,0
Completely too small. A large is a small.,0
"Don't bother with this product. It is just a piece of plastic that clips (poorly) onto an ordinary mousetrap. It doesn't like to stay on, and is a pain to use. They also don't work well.",0
"There was too much gravy and not enough choice cuts in each can. Pedigree should look into this, because the cans I buy in the store are packed tightly with choice cuts. You can shake the can and hear the liquid in the ones we ordered.",1
did not last at all smell was bad in 24 hrs and the dust,0
Bought to use indoors as a hideaway for my male dog. He LOVES it. He can hide from the 2 girls and get some rest. Would definitely recommend to someone that is looking for a lightweight indoor/outdoor dog house.,1
"Buyer beware! Unit has worked very well for us until recently (hence the 2 stars instead of 1). We have not had it 3 years yet. We were noticing that our dog seemed to be getting out of her area. After investigation and a lengthy phone conversation with customer service, we have discovered that our unit is broken. Unfortunately, PetSafe only has a 1 year warranty. We were told that the only option we have is to buy a new unit for $180. Seriously? We can't even get 3 years out of it? Thanks for nothing PetSafe!",0
It's for my old dog. She liked to use it and I also satisfied.,1
the cats luv this glove,1
"The small bowl is VERY small. I picked it because the width would fit into my large dog feeder tray, however the depth is really short. The small size would be great for a small dog, say under 20 lbs.",0
too loud,0
"I had high expectations for this product but I was let down. After reading other reviewers praise for this product I was eager to try it with my 20lb Boston terrier who started acting out of control anxious this year when shes alone out back. I gave her one and about 10 minutes later put her outside; Holy cow! Her anxiety soared, it was over an hour till she finally calm down even a little and I haven't used it again. My dog might not be a good test subject or maybe I didn't give it to her at the right time, who knows but Im reluctant to try again.",0
"My dog hates this bed, I am not sure why. She has another bed by Brindle and loves it, but for some reason would rather lay on the floor",0
"Received the filter with a crack in the canister near where the handle connects. I didn't detect the crack until I set it up; set up was easy enough. As soon as I primed it and waited for it to fill, I plugged it in and water began to spray out from one side. I thought I had  a bad seal, so I took the top off again and carefully set it back in place. I had the same problem, water sprayed out of the side. I took the whole thing back apart and looked at it closely under good lighting and sure enough there was a small crack in the plastic near where the handle rotates and locks in to place. I really think that the way the top seals, with the handle serving as a latching mechanism is a bad design. The plastic is just too easily damaged and if you get a crack, chip, or break, it won't seal properly. I guess I'm stuck with it now, so I ordered a new canister which will increase my total cost to way more that the filter is worth, but at this point it's either toss is out for a total loss or replace the canister and hope to get a long life out of the filter to make it worth it. If you buy it, check it out for cracks very carefully before putting it in use. I know I'm going to have to handle it very carefully due to the weakness of the latch design.
Ok, I have now used this filter for 6 months. I currently have 8 other canister filters and have owned probably 15 in my life. This is the worst filter I have ever used. I can only assume that the people who have an older model bought it before the quality took a nosedive. The flow rate is ridiculously low. After cleaning throughly it will put out a fair amount of flow but within a few days the flow is back to a trickle. This is one of four canisters (three are made by other manufacturers) used on my 75 gallon tank. It is always the one that clogs first while the other filters go for months without a reduction in flow. I cannot recommend this filter. Save yourself the trouble and avoid it.
After reading some of the reviews, there are some who gave this filter a good review, but others who experienced the same problems I have had. Makes me wonder if some of us were shipped a copy made with cheaper materials and passed off as a Eheim. The one I received could not be the same product as the one some people rave about.  ???",0
"Perfect toy for my English Mastiff. Tough & solid. Most dog toys don't last long with her, but this is durable enough. She loves it.",1
Sturdy bowl,1
"Just arrived today, for Bentleys 6 th birthday, hoping to help, will let you know when I have used the whole bottle and order more.",1
Dog would lay nest to it.  Fabric is shiny and rather cheap looking.,0
Sizing is way off,0
"Bed didn't last 12 hours. Stitching came apart causing it to collapse. Great frame, just the stitching is very poor.",0
I bought this as a warehouse deal since the packaging was damaged. I saved 75 dollars buying this way and the fence works PERFECT. All the pieces were in the box and we couldn't be more pleased with the transaction. Our 70 lbs black lab is doing great and our 13 lb jack russel is doing great on it. They understood the concept with only a few shocks. We already trust them in the fence when we are not home. Great buy and thousands cheaper than an actual fence around the yard.,1
Unfortunately I didn't look into the reviews before I purchased. My dog within 2 minutes of setting it down had all 10 treats in her stomach. I thought it would be tougher to move open or that it would pivot in a way that wouldnt expose all of the treats at once... I was wrong though. Unfortunately I will have to try a more tough puzzle toy next time.,0
My cat loves these treats.  She can be heard throughout the house meowing for them.,1
"Huge waste of money. My cat will not touch it. The real test was with the stray cat who is not picky at all. She would not eat it either! Finally test was that the racoon, skunk and opossum would not eat it after the stray cat refused it. It sat outside all night with multiple hungry animals and none of them were interested. Complete fail of a product. I tried it since it is human grade and there is no flavor. I could see why the animals would not eat this. Even animals want something that tastes good.",0
"These are much better than the non 'advanced' version.  I can visibly see the urine is absorbed a lot sooner.  This will be my go-to pad.  If they could only cut down on the occasional defective pad, they would get 5 stars",1
"I have three cats and two of them hate the drops that prevent fleas, running and hiding when it's applied or when they smell it. Then they try to lick it off themselves and each other. Program seemed like the solution, but they start scratching fleas again about two weeks after taking the pill. I also have tried the mix-with-food Program liquid, but the two drop-hating cats won't eat enough food at one time to consume all of it and won't finish the food later either, so it isn't effective.

My veterinarian doesn't carry Program pills and his assistant said it was because they hadn't been effective. I order flea remedies on line anyway because they cost less than at the vet's office, but even the drops seem less effective after a time. The vet's assistant recommended alternating two brands of the drops on a monthly basis.",0
Didn't even last an hour. Don't waste your money!,0
It seems to be working well but I prefer the BioEnzyme brand which I did not find on Amazon.,1
This is the worst product I have ever purchased in my life!!!!! I never made it through half a ride before the leash snapped. I have a 60 dog that I had to hold on to with one hand while walking my bike with the other. I wrote the company about this product and got no response. The leash is made up of a bunch of tiny rubber bands and a nylon wrapping over it.,0
This has helped my 12-year old girl greatly.  Whatever is in this is working as well as the pain pills she was receiving from the vet which were very costly.  I highly recommend giving it a try.,1
Very cute!,1
"I'm a vet tech and have used these for years to help pill patients and animals I petsit.  I started using these myself this year after my own dog's health has declined and is now on a lot of medications.  He has IBD and a lot of food sensitivities so I was happy to see they now have the Duck & Pea (it's not a commonly used protein so it's good for animals with food allergies).  He tolerates them well, love them.  I have never had a problem with him rejecting anything in a pill pocket.  I get the capsule size.  If I'm giving 3-4 pills, I usually split it and only use half of the pocket.  Otherwise, I use the whole thing if I'm giving him everything at once (6-7 pills). Every flavor, except for the Peanut Butter, is pretty soft and very easy to smush which enable you to cover all of the pills.  The one thing that people may not like; the Duck & Pea have a very heavy smell.  It doesn't leak out when the bag is closed but when I opened the bag for the first time, it was a punch in the face.  My dog was super excited though, so I guess that's the point. I have now gotten used to the smell but it's very strong.  The amazon price is great, even cheaper now that I've set up a subscription.",1
This is a total rip off! The 'hooks' are too small to fit over the bars of my birdcage. The bars of my birdcage are fairly thick and the dinky little hooks will not work. It is only a little tiny cheaply made plastic rectangle with no good way to attach it to my bird's cage. It cannot hold more than about an inch of water and it is only 4 3/4 inches by just under 3 inches.,0
Rubbed the hair off my dogs face after only being on for a short while.,0
My daughter loves it!,1
Got it in grey pretty good quality now it doesn't keep ALL the litter off your floor but it still does a pretty good Job,1
Works well for out dogs during storms.,1
Cats love these,1
This dog food is good for dogs with sensitive digestive systems.  Like that has no grain and my research showed this product has never been recalled.,1
My Tonkenese has IBS. Every diet we tried she couldn't keep down. Even the Diet we bought from the vet!  But the Farmina wild boar she can eat and digest. Her fur feels softer as well. I only wish this formula came in 20 pound bags!!!!!,1
Works really well. Would definitely buy again.,1
Very pleased with product and delivery.,1
Yummy yummy cat food.,1
"Given we have an aging goldie at home, was very much looking forward to getting this product (shipped to a relative in the US, who helped bring it home to Singapore to us.) For some reason my dog refuses to eat his food when the supplement is added. We've tried reducing the quantity to a quarter of recommended, but as long as it's present in the food my dog just wouldn't touch it. I don't know how good this supplement is from a nutritional point of view, but my dog definitely doesn't find it palatable. :(",0
"goes off all day, even when dog is not barking",0
"My dog became very ill from this product. There is lots of information on the web linking these treats and other brands also made in China to illness in dogs, especially small breeds. Not worth the risk!",0
Quality seems fine but the kittens just aren't into them.,0
My dog just wants to pick up and chew on it to get to the treats which isn't safe.,0
I've bought these refill packs in the past w/o problem.  Recently I purchased another refill pack only to find the new bags are much smaller and rip in half right off the roll.  What an awful design change.  I've never contacted a company with a complaint but I did it for this.  Their product went from great to completely unusable.  I'm throwing what I have away and never buying this new design again.  What a waste of money.,0
"My two cats really like entertaining themselves with this scratcher.  They would alternate from trying to get the ball out to scratching the cardboard material in the middle.  However, after so many months of playing, the ball came out.  I guess they were really trying to get it out.  But I put it back in there and it's still good for now.",1
Very poor quality!,0
Easy to use/setup... just be care with strap and your dog in the bag... weight will shift!!!,1
I have small dogs and this is just to big for them.,0
I ordered an XL for my dog who is a mix out and bull mastiff but it's more like a medium. I ordered this before I moved and due to my job I couldn't have my dog so my boyfriend took him. He just tried to put it on him and the head home barely got over his head and the straps were no where near connecting and we loosened every strap. I wish I was able to check before hand because now I can't return it.,0
"Smelled awful
Keep on hunting.  The wood chip stuff smells WAY better.",0
These are not that big. If your dog make big mess. it is almost useless. You will still have mess on your floor. I wish I bought a bigger mat.,1
"The sizing is way off on these, so my advice is to order larger than what you expect would fit your dog.",0
"The Pet Bowl constantly splashes water outside the bowl as the car moves.  The whole idea of this purchase was to have a spill proof Pet Bowl in the vehicle.  To use this water container, it needs to be inside of another container to keep the rug in the car from becoming soaked, therefore it is not as advertised, I have two and they both have the same problem.",0
"The kitty loves it!  My neighbor has an ""Outside Cat"" which should be against the law in the first place, that has no place to stay warm in the freezing cold of Pennsylvania and with winter just starting this 3 month old kitty hasn't got a clue how much colder it's going to get. So I bought this and put it in my garden shed and she loves it.  She can be found there all through the day and night.  This is a blessing for outdoor cats and can save their lives in harsh conditions.  I would highly recomend this heated bed!",1
"I was really skeptical about using this because it is hard to believe that anything not super chemically based would actually work against our tick outbreak but so far we have been tick free in our last two outings and we know they are there because we end up with them on us but my dog has not had any on her! I am really impressed by the ease of applying it on her and how effective it truly is. I will definitely reorder when needed.
You can also spray it around the house and on the pet beds. It does have a strong cedar smell but it doesn't have an oily residue so no grossness like flea medicine.",1
Even using a large air pump and manually putting more holes using a safety pin to get more air bubbles. Bubbles only come out of one end of the air stone. and one of the LED lights never worked.,0
"I ordered an xl and it was too small for my Jack Russell. It was nice, but, way off on size.",0
Very difficult to get the dog in the bog.  Not really usable.,0
Needed something to hold pad down as my older dog would rip them apart. This did the job and thankfully my new puppy no longer needs it.,1
I bought these balls because both my German Shepherds love Orbee balls.  I was EXTREMLY disappointed however because within days the top layer on all 3 balls started to peel off.  Will not buy the Tennis ball style again,0
"Great Frisbee! This is definitely a durable materialI cant even see teeth marks in it yet when my shepherd picks it up. His other Frisbee has a ton of marks all over it. The only thing I think would be better is if it were just a bit bigger. It seems like it is aimed more towards a medium sized dog and really, its the large breeds that really pack a punch with their chewing tendencies.  But, it is the advertised size, so I am not taking off any stars from the review. This Frisbee flies well and is holding up to 150 pounds of german shepherd. Very happy!

My small dog ripped this thing to shreds in a matter of 2 days.,0
Terrible product. My dog immediately bent the cage and it lasted less than 1 week.,0
"My cat gives this 1 star. She had digestive problems so I bought this food and she would rather starve herself than eat it. She's normally not a very picky eater and happily ate the other 8-10 foods I gave her in the past, but this stuff is as appealing to her as eating newspaper.",0
When any force was put  on the collar it unsnapped,0
"Much to my surprise, someone on my panel of seven cats is eating this. Usually they don't like to try anything new. It is very soft, the consistency of baby food meat almost, and has a similar texture. The portions are just right, no waste and no having to put a cap on a half-used can for later. My only concern is how much plastic am I putting into the landfill. I need to check to see if this is recyclable plastic, which will involved thoroughly washing one container and examining it under a magnifying glass for a recycle code. If it is, I'll give it another star.

Later: Cat #8, who just joined our household recently, rescued off the side of the road, loves this!",1
"It had a stain on it, and the top isn't sturdy The roof collapses. Kind of disappointed because it does not look like the product on the commercial.",0
Simple to set up and use.,1
My dog does not like the texture and therefore will not use it. Other dogs obviously feel differently but its a bit of an uncomfortable material.,0
It was not very durable at all. I would have expected a tough toy made from fire hose material.,0
"My cat love them I hid them all over for her to find, even in little drawers. She gets one after we trim her nails and she will wait to get her Kitty Yums!",1
Could not use as the tag is none exsistent.,0
The cat seems to enjoy working for her food and she certainly cannot eat her full dish as quickly and this leads to less overall consumption.,1
"my bearded dragon blaze love these bites, we add them to his staple salad everyday.",1
Both of my dogs love Yummy Chummies. This is a healthy way to keep them happy. I would recommend this product to all dog owners.,1
"This is a unique professional grade, no-sting bitter formula designed to help deter and redirect your pets from chewing or scratching just about anything you use it on.  It's safe to use around the house on furniture, blinds, fabric, shoes, wood, walls, curtains and more.  This spray is also safe to use on your pet to stop them from further irritating sores, hot spots, bandages, wounds, summer itch, tail, mane and more.  Chewfix contains one of the most bitter substances ever discovered.  This extremely bitter taste acts as a deterrent for most pets.  This it discourages chewing around the house.  Since chewing is natural for puppies and kittens, this spray allows you to re-train your pet's behavior towards something you would rather them chew.  The no alcohol formula makes it so you can spray it directly on your pets without causing them pain or discomfort and without fear of harming them.  Spray it directly on hot spots, summer itch or any other problem areas to discourage chewing and biting.  It can even be sprayed over any topical medication.  They have 2 size options available that include 16 ounces (pictured) and 32 ounces, both at different price points.

As with past reviews, I am only focusing on how this product works with dogs.  Beings I do not own any cats, I am not comfortable in declaring its effectiveness in regards to felines.  With that being said, I will continue with my review.

When it comes to using aversives while training your dog, it all boils down to personal preference.  I strongly believe that you can't just use an aversive, like the spray featured here and be done with it.  It's my express belief that you need to pair it with good obedience training.  If you don't use obedience training in conjunction with the spray, as soon as the spray wears off, they'll return to the bad habit.

That being said, my dogs are pretty good about not chewing things up around the house.  Notice I said 'pretty good'?  There's always an exception to the rule.  My Bassett Hound, Jethro, loves getting in the garbage can and my Dachshund, McGee, has skin issues so he's always chewing on his legs.  No matter what obedience techniques we've tried in the past, they haven't been effective.

Since receiving this spray, I spray it in and around the garbage can and Jethro won't get into it.  He'll sniff around it, but that's about all.  I also spray it directly on McGee's legs a couple of times a day and I have noticed he doesn't chew on them as much as before.  I'm hoping that by using this spray and employing positive reinforcement and redirection training, it will rid my dogs fo their bad habits.  So far it's working to deter them from the action.

I love that the company backs this product up with a 100% empty bottle, 365 day money back guarantee.  If you're not satisfied with this spray within 365 days, no matter how much you've used, simply get in touch with them for a full refund (including shipping charges).  You can't beat a guarantee like that.

**I received this product at no charge**",1
I bought it for my brother s dog. He is very happy so far. Finally we have a rechargeable collar. Thanks,1
"Maybe good for smaller dogs, but my Border collie-Labs just flipped it over and ripped the thin backing right open.",0

I saw in the description and reviews that it doesn't run on any electric, which is always a plus. My cats were pretty much sniffing and pawing at it before I could even finish assembling it. I snapped the green plastic cover with the rubber nubby thing onto the ""Catit"" and sprinkled their favorite organic catnip inside the well of the nub attachment, and also inside the rubbery gray bristles, and let the games begin! My two cats actually fought over who could spend time with it first. The cats rubbing their heads against it, and rolling around with glee. They kept tearing off the pad and biting it (must've been the high from the catnip)! They were laying half-on, half-off of the pad area, which they didn't seem to really mind. I do think the green pad area (where the cats sit) should have deeper, more plush padding, and be a lot larger (in consideration that most cats in the U.S. are a bit large). They love that particular shade of green on the pad (lots of cats like this shade, I noticed). I had a long-haired cat once, who wasn't a Maine Coon cat, who got to be almost 16 or 17 pounds. If these do well, maybe they'll think about making a much larger, deeper, heated bed (with an automatic off setting when the cat leaves). One with the scratching/face rubbing area on all sides? Well, I were a big fluffy cat, that's what I'd want!",1
Good but rope didn't last with my dog,1
"I have a 55G tank for African cichlids, and I bought a couple of new ones. However, when I'm in the store purchasing new fish, I seem to never remember exactly how big my existing fish are. Needless to say, I was way off.
I had bought this to have on hand, and boy did it come in handy. My littles are on one side, and the bigs are on the other. The flow through the screen is wonderful, and the fit is snug enough to keep the fish seperated but still able to see each other.  It has picked up a little bit of algae, but nothing more than the tank already had here and there. It does wipe clean easily.",1
Bought this for our big nearly 100 lb dog. Was dissapointed with the size. But besides that jolly balls are great toys. My dogs love them and they have both outdoor and indoor ones.,1
"Even though I was not happy giving this to my two cats three times a day for 14 days, I used this religiously and never missed a dosage. On the 16th day, I was picking worms off of my cats Anus. I was very upset that I went through all that trouble for nothing. I would never buy this again.",0
My Texas Heeler loves these tough toys and doesnt tear them up at all!  One of the few toys that he doesn;t!,1
It didn't work ..too blue and made the aquarium too dark,0
"This should not by any means be advertised as a tank for a fish. Shrimp? A moss ball? MAYBE, but for anyone who actually knows how to keep fish and satisfy their needs, bettas (and most other fish) need 2.5 gallons MINIMUM with decorations and a CYCLED TANK to thrive. Bettas should live 5-7 years, and for whoever actually put a plecostomus (which can grow 2 ft. +), in this tank,they should live upwards of 10 years. The sellers of this product should not encourage animal abuse, and should make it clear which organisms (not how I did NOT say fish) can actually thrive in these tanks.",0
Pretty straightforward. Theyre rope chew toys. My puppy loves them. Keeps him busy.,1
Fits my 4lb teacup poodle wonderfully. Works decently in the water as well,1
This came in warped and scratched.  I do not believe it was a new top quality item.  I returned it.,0
"My 7 yr old granddaughter asked for this for Xmas 2013. She has a real artistic streak, and adores most anything creative. So, this was a hit, and I shall get her another.",1
Didn't like at all. Sent it back. You should receive Tuesday,0
Did not stay on our dog. Tried a different size but that didn't work out either.,0
My dog loves this chicken product.  I will use it again.,1
I bought the Arm & Hammer cat litter mainly because the box said it was dust free which was important to me because of where the litter boxes are located. I also had found previously with the Tidy Cats brand that light weight litter is easier to scoop. Unfortunately the Tidy Cats product proved to be much dustier than their regular weight product to the point that I stopped using it. After using 3 boxes of the Clump and Seal I found this product has very little if any dust. It clumps quite well and is easy to use.  The only negatives are that it is not as good at odor control as I'd like and it's considerably more expensive than the Tidy Cats brand I've used for years.,1
"8 months later this thing is still standing, despite getting used a few times daily by two cats.  My little one liked the pom toy briefly, but lost interest quickly.",1
"There's a note on the back of the 20lb box that an odor blocking additive is added to the litter. That doesn't mean baking soda. This litter is scented, and it's not a pleasant one. We just had to wash everything in the house and bathe the cats because my husband is allergic to fragrances.",0
Wont touch them. ,0
great,1
One of the few chew toys that doesn't get destroyed.  Our dog will pick it as her favorite toy every time.,1
Works!!!!!,1
"mine loves it,
get hair after 2 day",1
The material and embroidery were as expected. The clasp is too weak. My cat lost it 2 times in the first week and we luckily found it around the house. She lost it completely within 10 days.,0
"The plates are at a nice height for my larger cat, the only complaint is with the shape of the ball, the soft food gets stuck on the bottom corners and is hard for the cat to get out, however, it's not a bit deal, this is one of the hardest problems he has to solve all day, so it's a good exercise.",1
"This is supposed to challenge the dog mentally but the two halves that screw into eachother are not flush leaving not 4 small holes for treat delivery but an entire diameter.  No challenge the treats just all spill out.  Furthermore the suggested treats ""buddy-berries"" are horribly tiny molecules of food that spill out like water and game over even IF the sides were flush it would all pour strait out the second it's tipped.",0
Really helped during this scorching weather!,1
Mainly a sleeve of fabric that had no shape whatsoever and elastic broke 10 seconds after opening it.  Save yo money!,0
"Well, after reading all the positive results, I decided to buy one. I was excited to use it on my dog when it started barking. It did not make one bit a difference.
I can hear it humming when I get it close to my ear and the red light comes on, so I know it works. My dogs hearing is very good also. Even when I point to my dog 5 feet away, it still has no effect. Don't waste your money. Throw empty coke cans filled with a few pennies. It works better...",0
"I have been looking for a thicket Rawhide Retriever bone for my lab that would last longer. I have been getting some from Sam's club-which are inconsistant in the thickness and have been on the thinner side for awhile.
I read a bunch of the reviews on these and it appeared that they were good. I received them last week and are very disappointed in the size/thickness. Not to mention these give my lab bad gas and diarrhea.

I won't be purchasing these bones again.",0
"Great product for small to medium dogs or cats.  My large dog (80 lbs) figured out the door and forced it open within an hour.  Be sure to tighten the latch bolts securely as the latch is prone to rotate on the pole if the dog pushes on the gate.  Further, this product differed from the description and was 5.5' wide, 5' deep, and 4' high rather than the described 5'w, 4'd, 5'h.  All this aside, the quality of the materials and the relative low price of the product makes this an excellent choice for pet management.",1
"Your basic lease - I bought this to match the Cadet Blue Harness I bought for my dog. I only wish they offered it in a 6ft length but otherwise, it does its job.",1
"Great stuff, give it to all 4 dogs.",1
Doesn't kill tape worms like it advertises on the package.,0
"My dog is crazy, keep that in mind. She grabbed the bars with teeth and shook it several times and it pulled back slightly. If it had legs it would have probably given way on her. She also ate the seatbelt through the bars and chewed apart a baby mirror attached to the seat and it still stayed in place. For her safety we had to stop use, but it holds up. Easy to put together. She chewed the plastic pieces that attach the bars and if given more time would have gotten them off. If your digits a chewer maybe not the gate for you.",1
"This thing works perfectly. It completely freaked my cats out and now they won't dare to get near my kitchen counters.  Some reviews mentioned a beep or tone, but mine doesn't have that, it just sprays air when it senses motion. I like it that way, as I wouldn't want to wake up to beeping.

I've also had a little fun with this to prank people. :) They should market it for that too!",1
good little collar for the price,1
"I got these because I thought I would be saving myself some money not buying singles at the local healthy pet store.  The packaging is nice and it is what it says it is, but they're super basic.  The don't seem to have a lot of flavor and smell almost like some type of fresh plastic.  My dog really wasn't interested in them and I ended up giving most of them away to other dog owners.  The ones I get at the local store are smoked with mesquite or hickory wood like barbecue and and my dog LOVES them.",0
Caused my dog to have seizures. Cost me a lot of money to get my dog back healthy after using this flea collar.,0
"All my dogs love this healthy food. I give as treats, I sprinkle on their dinner and I know they are benefitting.",1
"We used this to fly one of our cats to Hawaii. He is 12 years old and weighs about 13 pounds - healthy and beautiful. On too many occasions to mention he was able to poke his head through the zippers even though we closed them and used the safety clips that are supposed to keep them closed. Encouraged by the fact that he could get his head partly out he kept trying and this led to his nose and face being severely scraped up after six hours of this. One time he even got his head out on the plane and we couldn't push it back in so he was choking while we were fumbling to release the zipper and safety clasps that were tight around his neck. What a complete nightmare! Our other cat flew over without incident in another carrier, so we would NOT recommend this one!",0
"I'm not sure I can believe all these great reviews are legit. I sprayed a chair with this stuff, absolutely doused it - and my cats started scratching it MORE than they were before! Instead of deterring them, it seems to have encouraged them. Waste of money.",0
"I am VERY dissatisfied. I just opened the box this past week--had enough food to last me until now--and discovered that I have a case of REGULAR, NOT SPECIAL DIET, Friskies Classic Pate, Salmon flavor.  So now I can use NONE of this food.

I realize that by not opening the shipment until now, I don't have much right to complain, but nevertheless I am greatly disappointed!  This has nothing to do with the cat food per se, but it does reflect VERY POORLY on the Amazon.com order fulfillment department.

M.B. McCord",0
It's like crack for puppies. They will do any trick in the book for one of these things.,1
Didn't get to use item due to it was spilled all in the box when it arrived. Would never purchase a item like this again.,0
Sturdy and destruction proof whilst still being interactive enough to keep destructive dog amused.,1
They look and feel well made and they seem to work well for now with no problem.  To sum it up for the price who wouldn't get these and they seem well made I'm using them on all my pumps.,1
Threw it away as it is not returnable. It was day-glow green.,0
"So soft and comfy, wish they made these in my size. My dog loves it, going to buy 2 more for our others dogs. Nice amount of padding, very soft, and seems very durable.",1
Very very thin. And it's about as big as a place mat,0
"My dog loves these, they are a healthier alternative to regular milk bone treats.  They are also a little cheaper than the pet store.  HOWEVER, I just received a package of 5 and what was with the wrapping Amazon? It was terrible.  The 5 bags were all wrapped up together in green plastic and taped together.  Took way too long to open the package and then when I finally did, there was tape residue all over the bag and my nails.  The previous delivery I received of these treats was not wrapped up like this, so I hope it won't be next time!",1
"Probably a good supplement but my small dog would not touch it - it smells very bad I think due to the seaweed. So I made homemade dog biscuits with it, a 50/50 mix with flour and this product, along with other ingredients. The smell was still very strong but my dog eventually and reluctantly would eat the treats. I think for big dogs who eat anything/everything this is probably more appropriate than for smaller dogs. Bear in mind our little shih-poo has a ravenous appetite but just wasn't a fan.",0
"I purchased this based on the reviews that I read which seemed industrucatible for any chewer.  I had the bed for 4 months and then my Golden retriever decided to see how durable this bed really was.  It is junk.  He got through the cover and now has gotten into the actual bedding and I came home to a house full of green stuffing.  I paid over a hundred bucks for this and when I contacted them they told me I was past my 3 month warranty but they would send me a coupon for a cover that is almost $70 bucks which was almost as much as the bed cost.  I would never buy anything from this company again.

Very displeased with their product.",0
Must have for all pet owners. Last long enough not to loose.,1
This product is misrepresented as all natural.  It looks nothing like its picture and appears to have been bleached.  My German Shepherd who loves natural deer antlers is not impressed nor am I.,0
Our little dog (26lb) has really bad skin sensitivities and will get very itchy depending on food. This is the best she has done. Duck and potatoes is a good combo and duck should be one of the least inflammatory protein sources. Grain free and limited ingredient. Her coat looks even better.,1
"For the first day this collar worked great. It startled my small dog when she barked and I really think she would have learned not to bark had the collar worked for more than a day. When we put it on her the next day, it simply didn't work. I was so disappointed. We thought perhaps it needed to be refilled but no,it just failed to work. I have requested another collar to be sent, I'd like to give it another try. Perhaps this one was defective.",0
This is my dog's absolute FAVORITE toy. She loves to grab it by the wings or tail and drag it around. It is also the only plush toy that has survived her chewing. She plays with it every day and we've had it for about 4 months and not a single tear yet. I will definitely be buying more of this brand toy in the future.,1
Works very well on my long haired Shepard.  Love that there is little or no Mess the wand attached to the vacuum makes for an easy grooming,1
I'm very disappointed one of the hooks was broken off of this item as though it was not well made. I initially thought it could be screwed in but now see it was glued on and is broken. I noticed after my return window closed so I can't get it replaced now.,0
Dog enjoys playing with these,1
"I would have rated 5 stars but the first day I take my dog to the dog park, one of the links end up breaking just from running and now I have to order another tag. BUY STRONGER KEYCHAIN LOOPS when you purchase this product!",0
"I really like this heated bucket. The water temp seems cold to the touch, but does not ice over. The standard plastic 2 gallon water bucket (sitting beside Farm Innovators) was frozen solid. I have the water bucket on the outside on the walkway beside my house, plugged in to an outlet. The Nighttime Temperature was in the 20s  for 2-3 days. Then back to low 30s-40's with daytime highs upper 40s to 50 degrees. Kentucky weather really changes quickly. This is why I like the Farm Innovators Heated Water Bucket. It is exactly the ice-free water container I needed for my dog,  Edna is a medium size , 13 year old part Chow and drinks a lot of water, summer and winter. In the freezing parts of winter I would rotate 2 buckets, keep 1 inside to thaw, clean it, and refill with fresh water. I have seen the fresh water bucket ice over in less than 20 minutes, making it difficult for Edna to get a drink.
  I really hope this unit will last several winters. I really like it and recommend it to others.",1
"my dog enjoyed it but it is definitely NOT anti-chew. Holes in it after 2 days and in the trash after 4, and my dog doesn't chew on his toys. Not worth the money",0
My cats absolutely loved these!,1
Really sad. i was really excited about this but a ventilate square is missing. I love in Chile and it is quite difficult to get hamster accesories.,0
I bought an finally got home to install this only to relize i need the biggest one for my dog. I want to return/exchange for the bigger one but found i missed my return date by a couple of days. I would love it if we could still do this please an thank you.,0
"My cat LOVES her harness.  She loves taking a walk outside.. In fact I have created a monster cat, because every time I go to the front door, she wines because she wants to go out. She knows she must wear her harness and waits while I put it on her.  It is a little too big but I was afraid to get a smaller one.",1
Nice variety Dogs like whistling  ball. Glow in dark is ok.,1
Cat food what can I say my cats eat it,1
Gator is cute but my little dog had the head torn apart with stuffing all over the house within an hour. Had several squeakers out and I had to take the toy away. Even if you watch your dog play with this - if they like to chew - they can easily swallow a squeaker. Not for any animal that likes to chew. Sewing easily can be taken apart.,0
"I don't usually review products on Amazon as they are usually awesome and I have no issues with them. But this cat food has been great for the past five or so years ...Until recently. The formula seems to have changed where the pieces are smaller and darker and since then my cat's (two of them), have been barfing all over the house. I experimented with a few things and tried just the wet food - then the dry.  it's definitely this dry cat food that makes them vomit, and in the vomit is this product. Strange as this dry cat food has not affected them at all in the past. So as you can assume I am no longer feeding them this dry cat food, and I would recommend anybody who is thinking about starting their pets on this Rocky Mountain cat food to definitely continue on and find a product with better quality control. And I am happy to say now my couch, bedding and floors no longer have cat vomit all over them. Yay!",0
I was curious to learn more about the origins of my adopted dog. When I adopted him they said he was probably Mastiff/German Shepherd mix. The DNA results I received were Rottweiler/Golden Retriever mix. I don't think this was very accurate. As my dog doesn't have the physical traits of either of those breeds. Plus they said he might grow to be full size at 92 lbs. when I filled out my registration I had already stated that he is 130 lbs. and he is fully grown. It seems like they didn't take into account the information they received from me at all. I don't know how reliable their information is.,0
This item broke within a few days. No response from seller when this information was conveyed.,0
Nice little things. I have a little dog that only eats about 1/2 to 3/4 of a can a day and this keeps em from getting crusty.,1
my bird swing on this he has a good time with this,1
"I buy Old Mother Hubbard treats a lot- I have three dogs. This sounded like a great deal since we hit the minis hard at my house. These ""Mini Friends"" are NOT the size of the Old Mother Hubbard mini treats. Deceptively labeled!  These are so ridiculously big I wouldn't give them to a horse!  I have been taking gallon ziplock bags to friends with dogs just to move product. They are not easy to break and the dogs are leaving crumbs all over the floor because they are so large. This great deal turned into a waste of money.  I have had no complaints on the taste, but wanted to let everyone know what they are in for.  Pictured are the friends with a regular OMH mini.",0
The price was great but the treats were a lot harder than the same treats that I buy from my local pet store.,0
"I have 3 dogs and it did nothing.  I would not purchasing this product.  If I could have returned it, I would have!!!",0
did not work,0
Nice for small dog. My small to medium dog unable to use. Walks on it like a hamster wheel. Unable to use. Heavier bottom would of benefited my situation better. It's nice for little dogs that aren't energized and hyper,0
"I haven't noticed a great difference in ;my pet's coat, but she loves it and I have to give it some more time I suspect.",1
"Has the Velcro closure on the top, do yourself a favor and pass on this one, I wish I had of! Not well made",0
birds love it and the price was good and way easier than going to the store,1
"Very disappointed. My German shepherd was having so much fun with this toy, but he chewed through it in less than 24 hours. Total waste.",0
This looks so cute in my office. My betta fish looks good in it and seems to enjoy it. I get a lot of compliments on it. It is about the size of a basketball cut in half.,1
"I love it, the cat....eh not so much yet. I have indoor only cats and they only go outside to go to the vet every year. I wanted these for an emergency situation where we are evacuated and don't want to keep the cats in their carrier the whole time. I put this on my cats to size and adjust it and he fought me until the last buckle clicked but once on he got accustomed to it he calmed down. Now I am not going to take him walking but I want to use it if we had to bug out or go to the vet quickly. Once sized properly, he cant wiggle out of them like another simple harness we tried. These are a great and clever design.",1
Ripped at multiple seams. Does not hold up well.,0
"I highly recommend this product. This was the first year I've ever dealt with fleas since I only have an indoor cat. I tried flea collars, flea baths, flea foggers, and knockoff versions of this product because I did not want to spend the money on the more expensive stuff. Well I got what I paid for. The fleas would appear to be gone and then reappear a couple days later. I'm only on my first month of treatment but I still don't see anymore fleas and I'm no longer getting bites either. My cat had no side effects and he seems to be scratching much less. This product is so easy to use and I'm glad I got an even better price on Amazon then the local pet store.",1
"Lots of bags, great price and the bags themselves are sturdy.  Never felt as though my finger would pop through or anything like that. Hopefully the 80lbs of stupid who I pick up after will live long enough to fill them all and maybe even another refill.

Great bags.  Good size.  No complaints.",1
"Purchased this for my mixed breed Shepard/lab.  Gave it to her for Christmas.  She sleeps on it regularly.  It started to develop a urine odor.  Separated the cover from the memory foam inserts.  Inside, the material holding the memory foam in place was SHREDDED.  My dog did not constantly scratch at it.  Shoddy material on the inside for such an expensive dog bed. Product description states that this is a ""Memory Foam"" sofa  bed.  It is literally pieces of basic foam material held together what looks to be cheese/terry cloth or something thinner.  my dog hasn't even slept on it for 4 months, and I have to throw it away because it is falling apart.  I doubt any part of the bed would survive one machine wash.",0
Have purchased this item in past. Easy to use and a variety of colors to choose from. I would recommend this to anyone.,1
"I bought and am using this on a 10 gallon tank that is heavily planted. It works great! My plants have taken off seize getting this.

The adjustable base is designed to work with many different tank lid setups and the light is really bright. My plants love it!

I run this light with a socket timer so it automatically turns on and off at set times.",1
"Love the raised bed,  my dog loves it also.  but it says that you can register it online be there is no link to do that.",1
Do not purchase this for your pet. The pieces are not securely fastened and it comes apart creating a choking hazard out of both the loose pieces and the bell inside.,0
"Everything I could want in a dog leash. Very heavy duty, feels well made - clip mechanism works smoothly. Has a metal ring near the grip to clip things to like poop bags and/or a treat bag.",1
this product literally lasted me 5 min and broke,0
This is a very bad item that no one should purchase if you care for your fish. This item killed my fish in matter of 4 hours. No instructions or whatsoever on the product detail and its just not a good fit for your fish.,0
XXXS is too large for 5lb. Chichuhua. Boots came off after 4 steps. Not recommended and retuned.,0
"I had rescued my dog from an extremely abusive home, they had been feeding her is product and since I thought it sounded awesome I kept her on it. When she moved into my house her bowel movements were full of blood and a foamy liquid... I thought it might have been the stress of the move...as the months go by her bowel movements were still completely liquid and she was loosing all her fur, we had taken her to the vets multiple times and put her on multiple medications..nothing seemed to work... A month later we decided to switch her to the Beyond Chicken instead of Salmon and almost instantly
her bowel movements were solid and she quit shedding... I have no idea what is in the Salmon mix, but it was destroying my dog from the inside. So much for all natural.",0
"came fast
works great
 for my 2 puppies
1 is  1yr. other is 6 months
product  did not bother my dogs at all
yes I would buy again",1
This does go off when my dog shakes his head but not all the time. I think it has to do with the tightness of the collar and placement. He is afraid of the spraying sound so this stops him in his tracks for barking.,1
"Fancy Feast is good cat food but it's tricky for me to get the flavor my cat will
always eat since she is a gorgeous picky female.  This brand also comes in many different textures and the flaky version, as well as any type with gravy, neither of my cats will touch.
This particular Chicken Feast flavor is what they call the ""classic"" which is the usual
texture of cat food and the one both my cats like.  I found it difficult to say the least to pick out the correct texture when in the supermarket as there are so many different flavors and textures available and the cans are jumbled together so I had to fish through them trying to find ones marked ""classic"", so I prefer getting this by the case here on Amazon.

Sheba does have slight allergies to certain cat foods, as do many cats.  They itch and can develop bumps under their chins or in the case of one poor cat I had, terrible bumps and systemic itching all over, with fur loss, if the exact right food isn't given to them. That cat had to get only Hill's hypoallergy formula food from the vet or he would be tortured by itching, bumps and fur loss.

Also using only stainless steel bowls for food and water helps tremendously if your cat gets chin bumps. Even plastic dishes get bacteria that can cause itchy bumps under a cat's chin.
My cats love this chicken flavor and texture and it doesn't cause any allergy problems in Sheba so far.  She also has no itchy problem with Nutro dry cat food so I can recommend that one if your cat has a problem with itchy skin bumps.  In fact her fur is just incredibly gorgeous and she is a big fit muscular healthy cat, so I can recommend this highly.",1
The numbers are so small you'd need a magnifying glass to see them. This was a waste of money,0
Our dog has never gotten tired of this chow.,1
front wheels wobbled so bad.  one of the front wheels was riveted on backwards.  locking wheels didn't keep the wheels straight.  don't do it.,0
Put jumping beans in these. Cat loves to play with them.,1
This has helped my dog Bella's stomach a lot. Will order them again.,1
Dogs love it!,1
"Came fast, simple to use. Fit nicely and worked!",1
"I do love this mask as it provides great sun protection and I have not seen any sunburn on my QH/paints all white face.

I have 2 QH/paint mares that have white faces and was looking for a mask that gave them good sun protection as they hate me rubbing their faces down with Desitin. One mare is 16.3 & wears a large horse size Weaver brand halter (no snaps) and the other mare is 15.0 & wears a small horse size Weaver brand halter (no snaps). I bought a Horse size mask for the large mare and it fit well as the throat latch has a stretchy addition, but I bought the Arab size mask for the small mare and it was to small (didn't cover her nose) because the reviews said the mask ran big. So I am returning the Arab size and ordering another Horse size to see if that one covers her nose and fits looser around her eyes.",1
my dog has been sick since i gave him these pills he has had  diarrhea  since day 1.  keep  your money,0
Collar did not work...the tone only sounded when my 7lb dog scratch at his neck.  Seller claimed this was because of fur underneath the collar...lol,0
Nice design but the plastic clip unsnaps when my dog gives it a tug(65 lbs pitbull). Also unsnaps when i used the handle. Metal clips would of worked better,0
Not even close to size stated.,0
Aggressive chewers will destroy this toy..  Very sad,0
Good product,1
The picture should be updated to what it really looks like. There's a white collar attached to the bow tie and the elastic black string just killed the whole look.,0
"My 19 year old cat loves them. Now she gets in and out of my bed by herself.  The steps are deep enough, otherwise she would not use them.",1
"I think this product is a great idea, it's attractive and easy to use.  Or at least it's supposed to be.  I ordered two of these Top-fill feeders and upon arrival one leaked so badly that it couldn't be used.  I did use the second one but the first time I took it apart to clean (it got ants in it) it also lost the abiblity to hold sugar water and dumped it all over my floor while I carried it to the door.  I've very disappointed...",0
"I got this on sale for my girlfriend for Christmas. I was unable to get it working on her WiFi so I returned it.

I am a game developer(programming) and have extensive experience with network configurations etc. The fact that I realized within 10 min of setting it up that we should return it, combined with people reporting customer service is telling them they have to forward ports or disable firewalls is ridiculous considering the cost of the product. And now they are apparently also trying to sell online video storage subscription??, lol.

I was going to get her the newer, ""Play"" model. But the reviews on that seem to say the same thing. Too bad, I really wanted to like this, but it's useless if it's not accessible over the internet easily(or at all).",0
Total waste of money. The side scratchers are useless because there i no way to scratch on them because it is small. Neither cat has shown any interest in this. I don't understand what people think is so great about this.,0
"Worked great until it simply stopped working just a few weeks after purchase.  No amount of cleaning, priming, etc. will start proper flow again.  Will never buy another Rena product.",0
<3,1
My dog is a terrier (pit) and she's 75 bs. She has severe anxiety which causes a lot of digestive issues. I have tried multiple types of very expensive dog food for her. She is 10 yrs old and this is the only food I can feed her that won't cause horrible gas. This has saved my life... literally. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS DOG FOOD. The feed store that I buy this from actually started feeding this to their dogs who are dobermans and they recently tried a different kind and went straight back to this. BEST DOG FOOD EVER!!,1
Great for combing my ShiTzu and large end for tangles,1
"The buggy works well for my 22 pound Scotty , easy to assemble and to fold up for transport.  Package arrived in good condition and in the time frame promised.",1
"We have seen cute little dogs riding motorcylces wearing these doggles. We thought this would be the answer to our hunting dogs problem. We have a very active duck hunting dog that was getting sharp stickers in her eyes causing scratches & pain to her eye balls. Our Vet recommended trying Doggles. We ordered them immediately and they came within a few days. Unfortunately, no matter how tight we tried to make them, our dog easily would swipe them off her head. They would also not stay on if she tried to swim with them to retrieve ducks. We had to return them. Apparently Doggles work great for cute little motorcycle dogs to keep the sun out, but not for active/hunting dogs.",0
Made my dog lose weight so I had to feed him more. Switched to the petcurean brand at a holistic dog store near me.,0
I am very pleased with the Smart Ramp.  It was the only one I found  when searching  numerous sites that has protection rubber on both ends that  protect the surface of the vichicle;  and it was no more expensive or was less than others.  Surface is easy for my Boxer to use. Light enough for me to easily manipulate effectively.  I would definitely recommend this ramp,1
"This larger size fits a little better, but the design is still very poor although the concept is good. I''m hoping Amazon will refund me!",0
"My lab loves it. It would not be appropriate for dogs with short tongues or snouts, as the channels are very deep.",1
I am not finding this product to be very effective at all.  Both my wife and myself have been using it with mixed results.,0
"it is not a good training pad, the back on the pad is wet.",0
"My dog gets more water around him then in his mouth most the time. This is awesome, he can drink and walk away without looking like my kitchen flooded. We also put it in his crate during the day so he doesn't spill his water and it works great there too! I haven't even used it for traveling! No odd plastic smell problem here either.",1
We have a Momma cat and her kitten. I like this food because it is for any age and the can both it it. They also liked the food.,1
Misunderstood that it was a toy!,0
"These small balls are not extra bouncy and is harder than tennis balls. My half corgi is not as interested in these as she is with the Kong squeaker tennis balls. She loves to play with the squeaker balls because its a nicer texture to chew on, are bouncier and they also squeak. These balls do none of that.",0
"Made my morkie barf for 5 days straight and she never pukes, hurls, vomits (ha, fun). Not for every dog I guess.",0
My box turtle loves loves loves these crickets!,1
My dog snapped it in half only after having it on for two days.,0
"I'm sure they're good, I just have an extremely picky dog.",0
"I have a 1 1/2? (or close to that) gallon tank and this works well for cleaning it w/ out having to dump out everything to clean it.  I like that it is self-starting, you just have to have the vac part submerged and move it up and down a few times to get it going.  The one thing that I don't like about it is that for the size/height of the tank I am using it for I have to pour extra water into the tank to finish cleaning it with this because the water level gets too low, too quickly to get the whole thing cleaned out.  This is not a flaw in the product but rather due to the size of the tank.  However, the flow is slow enough that I dnt worry about the tank emptying too quickly.",1
"I like the top opening as I used this crate to confine my small dog for a month after her back surgery.  It's hard to get them out from the side when you have to support her back.  The crate seems well made, but I've only had it a couple of weeks and put her in it when she's right next to me so she can't tear it up to escape.  Will definitely not put her in it unattended.  Will also use it in the car as it's large enough for her to move around in.  Megan loves it as she likes the safe feeling of a den.",1
It's real coconut oil but didn't help me schnauzer's skin,0
A lot cheaper then picking them up local and it is the same unit.,1
"I've had this bed for about 4 months. I orders the fleece one and I love the size, but it holds hair and smells. It holds up well in the wash, but the hair and smells are hard to get out. I have a new (2 months old) Whirlpool HE washer with no agitatior. I have a short haired pit bull mix and her hair stays in the fleece. With that said, it is durable and affordable, so I just ordered the grey bed and with throw out the fleece one.",0
"The product description says that this will ""fit"" up to a 20# dog. I don't know what they're talking about as my 14# Poodle mix barely fit. He couldn't even lay down in it, plus the way it's made he actually hurt himself trying to find a comfortable way to sit in it. I am VERY disappointed.",0
Our dog wouldn't eat this food.  Ended up having to buy something different.,0
"I got this for the possibility of eradicating the itchiness my yellow lab seems to have -- with or without fleas.  There has been a marked improvement in her coat - I still use Frontline during the flea season, but intend on using these tablets for both her and my german shepherd year-round.  They seem to enjoy them, and both of them have minimal scratching now.  AND their coats are just soft, shiny and beautiful!",1
No complaints.,1
It doesnt work. I was expecting a bit more but my 2 Yorkies did not even respond to it. Waste of money unfortunately.,0
My cats would not drink their water with this in it.  It leaves a film on the water and I returned the product.,0
My dog loves them!,1
"The only reason this does not get 5 stars is because even with all bolts tights the top perch does a nice wiggle when my cat is on it.  Also my cat will not jump to the top perch, but loves it up there if I put him on it.  I am thinking of adding something he can climb on to reach it.

Also the hide hole was tested with a hair ball, and cushion cover washed with no issues and cat is back to sleeping in there right now.",1
One of the few toys I ever purchased for my dogs they had no interest in.  Too stiff and no squeaky enough to be of interest.,0
ok,0
"Arrived broken, with shattered glass.  The box had no damage and was not labeled as fragile.",0
Very sturdy and easy to use. It's tall enough that my rabbits are easily contained when I need them to be. This is comfortable size for small to medium pets.,1
"On only the 2nd day of use, the plastic on the top started to blister, with a burnt smell in the room. Good thing we were home. :( Was used 100% properly, open all around so there is no reason it should have overheated. Don't risk a fire!",0
the thing that attaches the wrake to the handle broke.  otherwise works fine.  I wouldn't buy this again just for the reason noted in the first line.,0
I had my dog fitted for this muzzle.  I was gone for 45 min came home to find she rubbed a spot the size of a quarter at the top of her muzzle.  Her hair hasn't grown back. HORRIBLE PRODUCT.,0
"This would be a great product if your dog is not prone to escaping.

Unfortunately, the end zippers have only one zipper pull.  When the end is closed, the zipper pull is at the bottom of the carrier where it leaves a tiny space just perfect for my dog to poke a nail through.  There isn't any thing to attach to the pull.  My dog would discover this and be out in minutes.

Oddly, the mesh windows have two zipper pulls that meet at the top of the window where they are not as easily accessed by a dog. They can be clipped together for additional security -- not necessary for most dogs.  I don't know why they thought of that with the windows and not with the ends.

It's really attractive serves multiple purposes.  I am sad to return it.",0
"I purchased one of these for my mother's dog - a Chesapeake Bay retriever mix - who destroyed it in minutes.  After a pulled tooth, however, I purchased her another and the second has been around, intact, for years.  The dog loves it, Mom puts dinner in it for the dog, and she (the dog - not Mom) rolls it all over the house.

So, I purchased one after adopting my own dog - he didn't quite get the concept at first, but after watching Mom's dog, he too got the hang of it, and will spend who knows how long rolling it around to get every last bit of food out.

We've adopted another dog - and one the of the first purchases for her was this ball.  She's not quite got the hang of it yet, but I suspect she will catch on sooner rather than later.  (The pups don't have daily access to this ball).

The one problem I've run into with this ball is keeping it clean - we have a doggy door, and the first adoptee takes it outside and gets it filthy, then naturally brings it back in the house to leave little rails of dirt all over.  I have no problem tossing it in the dishwasher, but ran into trouble with the inside drying out.  So, we usually plug the hole with a champagne cork so we don't have to wait so long for it to dry on the inside.",1
"My dog likes to throw up in the car. I needed something to protect the bench seat in my 1999 Ford Explorer, and this AmazonBasic seatcover fit the bill. Price was right, and installation was easy. Wiping off the puke was never easier.",1
The straps are too thin and within just a few days the strap were curled instead of laying flat and this I am sure is not as comfortable for my dog. Now I am looking to buy a new and better harness.,0
My puppy loves this toy.,1
Great,1
excellent,1
So useful and very easy to do replacements!,1
"It broke right away, within an hour to having it up. The quick release did not work.",0
"Wonderfully challenging for my dog the first time, but after it got wet with his sputum, it dissolved and parts fell off and became a choking hazard.  I can't understand why this is made out of cardboard material.  It would last longer and be enjoyable time and time again if they reconsidered the material.",0
"Too small of width and the clips were backwards so I had to twist it in order to get the closures to work. I have another Freedom Harness in a larger size that works better. It's a medium and had the 1"" width. Just made an adjustment for it to fit because my Whippet is between sizes.",0
"Playing fetch with my GSD in the living room, he crushed these catching mid air. Not once but twice. Went through four balls in 20 minutes. One fell apart and became lodged in his throat.

Soul less corporate minions",0

"This is a great nail filer for my dog. There are two speeds, slow and crazy fast. My dog is terrified of the second speed but the first speed is perfect. You want to make sure he sandpaper attachment used for grinding down the nails is on all the way of else it will shift around while filing.",1
"I searched for chinchilla accessories and this came up in the results. The only way my chinchilla could use it is if I cut him in half. There is no way an adult chinchilla could fit in this. I doubt larger rats or guinea pigs would fit, either.",0

"I had a fungal out break on my submerged wood & also few leaves that started to decompose .
The water in the tank started to look blurry & started to smell funny . Waste of $",0
My cats like this mat. It is a decent size and the quality is very good. I am happy with this purchase.,1
This bag came with the shoulder strap broken. I didn't open it up right away and file a claim so they will not return it now even though I have never used it. Obviously poor quality if it didn't even make it out of the box without breaking. Wouldn't want to put my 10b dog in it and have it break like that.,0
I ended returning it. It's to steep for little dogs like mine. There was little room to maneuver up and down. The steps is covered with rug but no cushion. Not as high enough for a bigger sofa so my dog could not push herself up.,0
Best and safe for dogs.  Trouble is they are expensive and my German Shepherd devours one in just a couple of minutes.  Golden Doodle 5 minutes.  Recommended by emergency room veterinarian.,1
Dog loves the food.,1
"Tried this in addition to the Nutri-Vet vitamins as my Scottish Terrier was suffering from allergies and lost a lot of his coat. He wouldn't eat them, period. I tried crushing them up and hiding them in his food and he refused to eat it. So, I think overall they're a waste of money. The Nutri-Vet vitamins I bought for him seem to have worked so there really wasn't a need for this addition to his regimen.",0
"I purchased the 50 watt version as a warehouse deal. I placed it in a ten gallon aquarium, and tested it for about 48 hours. I was unable to get the heater to hold a steady temp- it would click on after dropping 6-8 degrees below the current water temp, then click off almost immediately before actually warming the water. Sometimes it wouldnt come on at all. I suspect this was a faulty unit, and included a note with my return. Hopefully Amazon won't sell this particular unit again.",0
These little guys are so pretty!!!  I love them!!!  Very active!!!  Arrived packaged very well!!!,1
"Liked the  idea but did not have a good fit. Didnt stay put on head and too,long for feet.",0
my cats LOVE these treats....yummy!,1
My animals like it,1
Back piece won't stay up on back of couch!!!,0
"My kitty loves this, and it's a great healthy choice.  I highly recommend it.  I used to have to hitch a ride several miles to pick up a bag of this (started with the duck and green pea style, and finally settled on this), but now I can get it directly from Amazon.  Hooray!",1
Unreal how expensive this is and how little there is of it. The package is very deceptive. It's actually VERY TINY.,0
I have a 6 month old puppy who is not an aggressive biter. He bit the squeeker 3 whole times before it punctured and no longer works. There is no way to replace the squeeker without cutting open the toy. Dud.,0
"This product was is a disaster, unless you don't mind food flung all over the floor and having to hover over your dog while he's eating so that your other dog doesn't eat the pieces that have gotten all over the place. Yes, the dog does get his food slower, but the design is ridiculous. Used it once and will never use it again. Total waste of money. A couple of tennis balls in the old bowl was far better than this insane contraption.",0
"I ordered this cage after seeing the same brand but a different style of the cage in a local pet supplies store. I noticed that these HQ's are built very strong and sturdy compared to some of the other cages. I do not know many bird cage brands, but this one it the best that I have seen yet. Thank you guys. Order arrived soon and took about 25-35 minuted to put together.",1
My dogs love this food and I like the idea of feeding them as healthy a food as I can afford. I haven't noticed a reasonable difference in the shedding or even less poop as I have heard other people claim. The dogs love it though and I guess that's about as good a reason to buy it as any.,1
"I bought this collar for a 10 month old Chihuahua named Tiny that I inherited.
Pros: The collar works well and does not hurt the dog in the least.  It is preferable to a shock collar which, from research, I learned can result in sores on a dog's neck.  The dog learned immediately not to bark when his first collared bark produced a fine mist of citronella.  The collar works via a microphone in the unit and does not have to be tight on the dog's neck, another plus over shock collars.  With the collar on; the dog will growl about his concerns but does not bark. The weight of the unit does not seem to bother or hinder him.
The dog is a personable little guy and doesn't shy away from wearing the collar.  I only put the collar on him when he goes out in the backyard or when he hears the door bell.  He has never barked when on walks, meeting other dogs or people.  The collar is worn for a total of three to four hours a day.  According to the manufacturer twelve hours per day is the maximum the dog should wear the collar,.
Cons:  The unit I received does not turn off when the switch is placed in the on position.  However, if I remove the battery and reinsert it with the switch in the off position then the unit will remain off.  My solution has been to take the battery out of the unit when I remove the collar.  I've had the unit since the middle of March and today, May 13, the positive end of the battery and its seal literally fell off the battery.  This probably happened due to my removal of the battery so often and obviously cheap battery construction.  Replacement batteries can be found at Petco and PetSmart for $7 or $8.  The batteries are less expensive online.
Overall, the collar has been great for its intended purpose.
UPDATE:  I sent an email to Petsafe customer service about the problem with the collar not turning off.  Their return email requested that I reply to their email with my receipt attached and they have shipped me a new collar.  Once I receive the new collar, Petsafe is covering the cost of returning the defective collar.  It has a one year warranty.  I am pleased with the quick response from Petsafe and how they are covering all costs involved with the return.",1
"As others have stated, this is a cheaply made cat door, don't buy it. Besides the terribly designed locking mechanism, the door you install this in must be exactly a certain thickness, otherwise the front and back halves will not mount properly. In addition, the back half does not even screw into the door or the other half, instead, it is held on by taping it to the door! If you're trusting like me, you'll realize all this after you cut the hole in the door.",0
"When I first adopted my bunnies, I bought the Precision Pet Extreme rabbit hutch.  But then I decided to buy a new hutch where the bunnies could stretch their legs more.  So I bought this one.

Unlike the Precision hutch, this hutch can be put together by one person.  And the bunnies really like that they can go up and down.  However, over time, just a few weeks, the glue that holds the wood and the plastic tray together starts coming apart when they're washed.  The plastic starts to lift.  This happens on the tray and on the flat part of the ramp.  I even tried to glue it back, and it just won't hold.  When it fully comes apart, I will try to nail them down.

Also they went cheap on the lock on the top part.  They used one lock that locks both doors, however, the piece that holds both doors together is barely long enough.  You have to make sure that both doors are locked, as it would be easy to think they're both locked when only one is.",0
Kitty loves it.,1
"Have a 2 year old German shepherd, she loves these things. One of the few treats that can occupy her for mmore than 3 minutes.",1
"I am in love with the Lupine collar.  I was afarid at first of the ""quick release"" but I tried so hard to pull it apart.  Not like your usual quick release.  I can't believe that it has a lifetime gurantee.  As long as your pet is in the same size collar it is quranteed.  Lupine is worth the money.  And the quality is awesome.",1
"We purchased the hutch and after several months the plastic tray warped so bad it became unusable, I contacted the manufacturer who said they would send a new one out immediately, but it never came and now they won't respond.",0
"I do not usually review products I buy off Amazon. But this time I had to.

I Bought the Petmate LeBistro Pet Feeder and it arrived in good time. It was operational for about 4 months, after which the unit completely stopped working, the LCD went blank. I replaced the batteries, reconfigured and restarted the main LCD screen/settings. I sent back the feeder, got a new one.

The new unit worked fine for, again, about 4 months till it decided to infuriate me with its ineptitude. Im sure you can all appreciate the frustration I felt by this point. I tried 'resuscitating' the unit yet again with no luck. I emailed the company again with my issue and what do I get? :  'Since it has been more than a year since your original purchase the warranty has expired and we will not be able to replace the unit for you.'

This is where the utter disappointment comes in. I replied and got absolutely no response.

Disgusting customer service and product. They should be ashamed.",0
"The item was black, not white.  I have two of the white ones, and really enjoyed them.  The new, black ones do not work.  I do not know why, but the older ones were really useful.  I am disappointed, and will be returning them.  I bought two.",0
Hi. Got 4 snails and they all died within 1 day. Company replaced them and they died again. All my other fish and snails from other sources are fine.,0
"Bought this for my two corgis as a Christmas present and it lasted 1 day before they chewed a hole in it to eat the plastic squeaker. I removed the squeaker and allowed them to play with it now that there was no longer the threat of them eating plastic. Shortly after returning it to them I found the faux fur everywhere as it stripped away easily from the toy. Needless to say it it now in the trash. I gave it two stars because it was an adorable toy before my babies ate it, and it was packaged well. Would be a great toy for dogs that aren't as rough with their toys.",0
"I have had these balls in the tank for over a week.  They are still laying on the bottom and are exactly as when I took them out of the wrapper.  I followed the directions on the package, but so far these are of no use. :(",0
"I have always given my cats Science Diet. I got a dog, and after two bags of this food, I had to change..It gave him fishy breathe (yes it is a dog, his breathe doesn't need to be minty fresh, but this was on another level) and worst of all liquid stool..maybe it is my dog's stomach, or maybe the food, but since I switched his stool is back to normal and breathe not fishy smelling.",0
"So far so good. It fits larger than is average. Either that or I was not aware how small my dog is. Hes 18 pounds but requires the size 1, which is made for very small dogs. Either way, we are relieved to have a solution for him when strangers are around, or other dogs. Hes a treasured pet and his fear/anxiety is kept in check now. -J",1
"I have a leather couch, which may have contributed to this cover sliding all over the place. I would not recommend the product",0
"Initially we were very happy with the product but the first one, yes the first one, lasted maybe a few weeks before the 3 pieces of wiring broke right from the holder. Our 3 cats loved the way the feathers flew around so we bought another one. Literally 2 weeks in, the second breaks the same way. This time only all of the wiring fell right off the holder. Now we've got 3 sad kitties. We love Jackson and his products but the wiring needs to be stronger.",0
My dog did not react this what so ever,0
On the first use the locking mechanism locked and would not allow the leash in or out. Useless product!!!,0
He didn't enjoy this so much.,0
I was worried I would get a bed to small but the large comfortably holds my German Shepherd and chihuahua.  It was for my old Sheppard and his old bones. GREAT BUY.,1
"Cool idea, but not stable, small shelves, cats hate it. Not sure what to do with it now",0
This does not work for my dog at all. She weighs a little over 50 pounds and the recommended dose has zero effect. We have even tried adding a couple more. It seems like the days we've given it to her she has actually been MORE destructive.,0
This was a cute hideout for my Beta fish....until he tried to swim down the top hole and got stuck. He ended up tearing part of his fin and got a large cut on top of his body. We ended up cutting both side then snapping it to release him! If the hole was large and intended to let the fish swim in and oyt safely then I would have given this 5 stars.,0
Formaldehyde smell builds up quickly. Clumps are loose and difficult to scoop completely.,0
"says will connect to any hose. photo shows a male end of the hose connected to the female end on the bowl. We get ready to hook this up yesterday, it is half inch threads, not the normal 3/4 inch thread. The unit I got it has the male connector which would not be a huge issue but I now have to go and buy parts to make it fit a standard garden hose. Not impressed",0
"Arrived as described
Got a great and Is holding up to the beating my lab and pointer put it through. Good buy!",1
The 64 ounce bowl only holds 48 oz....I should have read the review on the 96oz bowl before purchasing!  The bowl is nicely stickered 64 oz. but one could not possibly get more than 48 oz in it.  I contacted the seller and received something of a snippy response.  I sent two replies a week apart to which I have heard nothing. Never again from this seller or their manufacturer.,0
"I got this system for my first kitten after being told by both a friend and a vet tech that this was the best thing out there. Boy oh boy were they completely wrong! It is definitely fantastic for masking the pee and smell of the cat pee but when he poos in it, it's like a 1 year old took his diaper off and poo'd all over the house! It's AWFUL to clean up! It doesn't clump, it smears all over the bottom & the sides (and the scooper when you're attempting to scoop it up), and it STINKS. There is NO masking the smell of the poo at all! You throw out a cup of pellets each time you clean it up which means a bag of pellets will DEFINITELY not last a month! This is with a 4 month old kitten pooing, I can't imagine with a full grown cat or multiple cats. Very, very bad investment. I wish I had bought ANYTHING else.",0
"It works well, but my pooch has long hair and the locks seem to get caught in it.",1
"Love this litter box, easy assembly and easy to clean! Well worth the money.",1
"Switched from Frontline it is no longer effect the ticks  So Far so Good 3 Month not  Single tick on either dog

My dog loves these - they shipped quickly and arrived intact.,1
"Measured and bought according to guidelines. Very, very difficult to put on. Probably should ave gotten one size larger. He's worn them twice...wish I could exchange them as I really like the product",0
"Loved the idea of a pet bed that allowed me to recycle old clothing and blankets not suitable for donation.  The covers are nice looking and the mesh insert makes it easier to fill the bed.  I purchased two covers, one mesh insert.  Problem:  the fabric used for these covers is lightweight. Within two days, my 5 month old boxer started chewing on the tag SEWN on the cover (I think a tag sewn on the top of a dog bed is a design flaw) and that was enough to enable her to rip the entire cover to shreds. Literally.  My pup is not an aggressive/power chewer - the fabric used to construct this cover is simply not suitable for use in a dog bed.  Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Leaving the door open allowed too many basement smells upstairs while also giving the dog free access to the litterbox. This significantly reduced the smells and my fat cat fit through. Really, he's a fat guy and after getting it we still didn't think he would fit but I think he loves it because of the brushes. He'll also run through the hole when we have visitors and likes to safely stay and play just behind the opening while still watching what is going on.

I felt terrible for cutting a hole into my solid hardwood door but it was needed for the entrance into the basement. I really appreciated the template provided for cutting. Made it much easier. We opted for the unpainted option so that we could paint it to match our accent color. The hole plugs were a nice finishing touch. The brush is a separate piece that can be easily removed for vacuuming or you can just vacuum in place.",1

****UPDATE****
7/31/2014
The Canister broke off where  the handle connects to it! Man oh man... This is not the same filter build/quality that I had 5 years ago. Its a shame. Knocking it down two stars.

****Original post****
The new pre filter looks like a nice upgrade. I am replacing a Cascade 1000, which is awful and takes forever to prime!",0
Every cat loves these trears.,1
I got this toy for my doggie for Christmas. She has yet to rip it apart like she has done with other toys. She loves it! Nice price for a sturdy dog toy.,1
way smaller than advertised,0
Well made and not too severe.,1
It is just too heavy for me and takes a bit too long to sift litter when you can't bend over well.,0
"This product advertises that it will kill fleas for at least 30 days.  I applied it to my totally indoor
cat and he  was Okay for 3 days then had them all over again.  I would have given it only 1 star
but it did work for 3 days.",0
Great stuff!!!!,1
My dog loves these. She gets one every morning.  Love the larger size bag.  Saves me time running to the grocery store for more.,1
"Couldn't wait to try this product.  I have two very picky male cats.  Had no problem making the transition within 3 days.  However, both my cats regularly pee standing up and the back splash simply is not high enough.  So all that urine mostly goes up and over to outside the box.  Maybe Tidy Cats could come up with a hood to retrofit?  Product does do what it says - no odor - no tracking litter - but could use some further refinement.",0
"Great bed, bad zipper. Went to wash the cover and zipper broke. Returning back to Amazon and will buy a different brand. Should have read the other reviews.  No way to close it back up see picture.",0
"Before we got this feeder, our cats would wake us up in the morning. We had gotten several versions of automatic feeders from our local pet stores and none of them ended up working so we always returned them. We were hesitant about paying the price for this one, but decided to get one to give it a shot. It worked out so well that we got another one for our other cat. Now, instead of waking us up or annoying us at feeding time, the cats go stand by and stare at their feeders. Highly recommend!",1
My cockatiel has a hurt leg from a pinched nerve so I want to give her as much healthy food as possible.  She LOVES this blend and waits by her bowl until I add it.,1
The top does not snap well into the bottom.  I had to play around with it for quite awhile when I first assembled it.  Now I just rest it on top.  You really don't even need the top unless you need to put it in the middle of a room...mine is under the stair well so being without a top isn't as gross as if it were in plain view.  I can see how other reviewers have a problem with pee getting out of it especially if you have a boy cat that squirts pee.  Just be careful when purchasing and read all the reviews.,0
perfect,1
"I wish I read other reviews before trying.  I purchased it to help with smoke odors.  Fortunately I tried it on my entry before using it everywhere.  It left terrible residue that could not be vacuumed up.  It wasn't on my agenda, but I ended up shampooing the area because it looked horrible.  The smell wasn't a problem for me, but I will never use it again.",0
Fantastic little moss balls that make any tank look aesthetically pleasing. They shipped very quickly and even had extras thrown in. This price is quite a steal compared to the same sized ones at your local Petsmart. I would definitely buy again!,1
Nice tag but chain irritates the skin.,0
"Really nice, high quality leash for my therapy dog:)",1
"I have the modkat unit for about 4 years now and by the 3 year mark, the liners start to deteriorate (I've washed the liners with every litter change, once every week) highly recommended to get spares so that you're not waiting for the clean one to dry",1
"I have used this product on my Maltese's paws for 3 years.  When I first got him, he had such soft perfect pads.  Then I walked him, lots and lots on all different surfaces.  Sadly, his pads roughened and got tough and ugly.  Then, I discovered this product and what a difference.  I only put it on him at bedtime, just a little rubbed into each pad.  At first he thought I was crazy, but now he looks forward to this as part of his bedtime routine.  You won't believe the transformation in your dog's paws.  After I rub it on, he licks his paws and that's ok.  I figured he was licking it off, but it still works and his pads are almost as soft as a puppy and we walk 5 miles a day on cement.  The product is worth the cost because a jar lasts several years.  That's right.  It only takes a small amount to make perfect paws.  I'm just finishing up the first jar I bought 3 years ago.  By rubbing this in every night, you will also pay attention to your dog's paws which take a lot of abuse on a daily basis.  You will notice cuts and things stuck in them that you may not have noticed before.",1
"I submitted a negative review which was rejected. Here goes again. This arrived quickly. The item was covered on the inside with short, white hairs, lots of short, white hairs. I was offended by the item being used, obviously used and returned and then sold as new. The only reason I kept the item was I was desperate to calm a rescue dog with a huge anxiety problem. I used a sticky roller to remove as much of the hair as I could, washed, more sticky roller, washed again & air dried.  It did calm the dog somewhat but she is still not perfectly calm. I'll take the small improvement  & will hope that this will improve her anxiety the more she wears it.",0
This made my dog sick . . . all over the carpet.  I will never get this again.,0
if you bake you must have,1
"the dogs don't seem to hear it, Nice design otherwise.",0
"When I bought this fountain it was amazing.  The sound is really pleasant and my cats absolutely loved it.  Unfortunately, within one month I came home and found it had leaked all over my kitchen floor.  I am so, so, disappointed, :(",0
Great purchase. Works great its easy to use and does not cause distress on my prize winning Male Betta fish. I highly recommend it.,1
I love it and my dog loves it!,1
"My dogs love these, but I hate them because they give my 3 dogs terrible gas! They contain sorbitol which is very gas-causing. I haven't found that they do anything for my dogs' breath or teeth.",0
Sadly this ball will have to be tossed in the trash although our German Shepherd loves it.  He repeatedly keeps grabbing it by putting his nose through the hole to carry it around.  In just the 2 days we have had it numerous times he gets it stuck on his nose and between his teeth.  Then he panics as the ball won't come loose and we have a hard time getting it off.  Just minutes ago it happened again and I had to calm him down to try and get it off.  I couldn't get it off myself as it clearly was stuck and he somehow was able to do it himself.  We don't need to worry each time that he plays with it.  Shame as he loved it.  We did also get the smaller version but for some reason he wasn't interested in it.,0
Dog loves to play with it,1
"I liked this product online, but I was very disappointed when I unpacked it.  It isn't carpeted; it's just some thin fabric glued to MDF board.  I was still willing to use it, but when I went to put it together, I ran into a problem with Step 1.  One of the holes that is supposed to be pre-drilled isn't there, and the other is too big for the screw.  I don't even know if it's fixable.  I guess you get what you pay for.  In this case, I'd recommend paying a little more for the quality, because you won't find it with this product.",0
"If you live in a country in which animal laws exist, please take pride in knowing that you aren't going to see any people walking around with live fish in their necklace pendants.  Most fish need at least 2.5 gallons to thrive.  If you value the lives of animals, you won't buy this product.",0
Great value and same quality of similar soft bedding for reasonable price!  Glad I ordered two and probably will order again!  Thank you!,1
This raw hide has lasted much longer than any other I have use.  My dog keeps busy with this for DAYS.  I even end up giving him a new one before he has finsihed the old.  Great product,1
"Did keep dog entertained for a few minutes...until he was able to crack the two halves apart and empty all the treats. Seems to be more luck to get the treats than skill, not a skill building process.",0
Great style but not very effective to keep your dog from escaping whenever it feels like.,0
"Borax, which you can get at any store that sells pest-killing gear, is a heck of alot cheaper and is the active ingredient in this product. You can do a net search and find the precise dilution to use. BUT, if you want to pay 10x more, get this.",0
one the item silencers was ripped when i opened the packaging,0
"Cute but not practical. My liter box and  my rather heavy set cat do not fit. May work for a smaller cat , who can use a small liter box.",0
Three bully's med-thick and 3 so thin I can snap them in half. Will not buy from this company again. Stick with Best Bully,0
Exactly the color as it appears online.  It has nice glaze and shape. Came exactly as described. I love it!,1
"Its a good quality material, my problem was, I have a medium size kinda skinny type dog, and when she started to wear this strong material rubbed her armpit badly, I mean bloody. Maybe the bigger size could work for a big dog with lot of hair, but definitely not for little dog with short hair.",0
This product has a very odd odor that I find distinctly unpleasant.  Perhaps it's the corn cob base.  Plus it is very pricy.  Would not buy again,0
Redbeetloves these ! Easy for him to hold too.,1
My item arrived with a hole in the top of the bag. A good portion was spilled out in the box.,1
"It's nice and roomy for my golden macaw .
It's nice and sturdy construction , I like the perch ( my bird too ) , it provides nice grip .
Swing provides her with exercise and entertainment .
She is a big girl and could be destructive but so far the swing is surviving and still hanging :-)
Was looking for swing to fit her but couldn't find it in stores . Glad Amazon provides a big variety of products !",1
"My cat has IBD. This product helps with diarrhea, plus she likes the flavor. She doesn't have much of an appetite, but sprinkling this tasty stuff really helps.",1
"I bought this on 1/19/2010 and then set the temperature to 77. It kept the water temperature to 82-83. It worked for the winter. When summer came, I unplugged the heater (still keeping the unit in the sump). Then with fall setting and as temperature started to fall, I restarted it. Overnight, the tank temperature shot to 92F and I saw all fishes gasping. Needless to say, lost my flame angel, mandarin, Clowns and Fire fish. That was one big disaster.

I called Hydor up and the gentleman said to send the heater to them as they wanted to check for abuse. He was very polite and seemed logical. He also mentioned to send in the least expensive way so I put it in an envelop and sent it. Four weeks passed and I did not hear back so called them. They did not receive it and unless I could show proof, would not send me a replacement. I guess in todays world, that is how it is...

If you buy this product, make sure you have temperature alerts to warn about overheating and if you have issues with the product and want to send it back, make sure you keep proof of delivery.",0
"Works great, I just wish it remembered my light settings if I turn it off and back on. I turn the lights off at night, and every day I have to re-select my color choice when I turn it back on, which means I have to keep the remote handy.

Still, a very cool device.",1
"Using it for a guinea pig. Ended up receiving a pink one, but that's no big deal. It attaches to the wire portion of the cage which when placed as low as possible is still a bit too high. Solved the issue by tilting it enough for the guinea pig to reach.
Guinea pig can't turn this over and spill the food like on the ceramic plate.",1
"My husband and I were eager to try out this product on our dogs, hoping that it would keep them away from the garbage cans. As my review says: Epic Fail! We followed the instructions to a tee and trained both our dogs. Both of them thought it was a great game to play - jump over the rock! They paid no attention to the ""static"" correction and the dogs are fairly well behaved. To us, it wasn't worth the time that we spent trying to even get it open. Epic fail!",0
"I have 3 cats- oldest is 9 and 2 youngest will be turning 2 in a few months. Thought the finicky queen would not enjoy it but she does! 2 younger ones love the high tier and fight for it. Hannah snoozing in her spot in the pic. It's a bit yellow/beige tone to the color than the photo but this is in our sunroom so goes well with the furniture there anyway. Plush faux fur/carpet is very soft and they love the 2 toys dangling to bat around. Younger female must have some coon cat in her because she's big...like 13lbs big already while the other 2 are @6lbs. She does move the tree a bit when she jumps around but just slightly. I don't have anything close by in terms of furniture for her to jump next onto so only way for her to get down, is to jump to each level. Don't want any acrobatic moves from her that might tip it over. I kept the ladders for stability as others said they removed them as they are useless. They love pouncing on each other while hiding in the hide-aways. They have already been scratching on the posts so love that and I give them treats when they do to encourage that vs my furniture.",1
"I like this product - well worth it.  Its easy to install and fits good on my 2014 Highlander.

The saving with the sale was great - I could not buy the products to sew one myself for that price.  Plus I got it within a day.",1
They wouldn't stay on my pups foot.,0
They look super cute and my dog does not mind wearing them. Perfect!,1
"Nice collar, the leather is super soft and looks good.",1
We had a dead mouse. It removed smell gradually for first 2 days by day 4 it was almost gone. It is an excellent product.,1
"Guess it's ok, just way to much powdered material, I wrote to the company asking if that was normal, since this was the first time I had seen and used this product. Needless to say, they never answered me. I will not buy it again. It seems like a waste, I will go back to adding veggies to my dogs diet.",0
The zipper on one of the bowls broke the very first time we used it.,0
"The cage arrived on Friday, I had read other costumer how got only box 1 of 2, so I was expecting to receive 2 boxes, but to my surprise Amazon stills not getting things right, I only got box 1 of 2, I've been trying to contact amazon to let them know and have box 2 sent to me with no luck, click after click you get sent to your account with no way to contact a living person to let them know and correct the problem, you get the choice to send the 1 box back so you can then be sent the complete order, this is idiotic!",0
Very disappointed in this product.  I have been a long time customer but apparently they have decided to change the formula.  The treats in my last bag are darker in color and very hard!  The packaging is also now different.  I will definitely not being buying again!,0
"My poodle is super fussy about treats. This is the only one she consistently eats. The pug, of course, enjoys them too. But he likes everything.",1
Some of the other kinds of biodegradable  bags tear easily. These don't. Convenient rolls. Pleasant scent.,1
These work great for various sized cat food cans. Even works great on pasta and soup cans for humans! Highly recommend getting several of these to keep around the kitchen.,1
"Strap was broken after 2 days.  Construction is terrible. My dog definitely falls in the ""medium"" size category, and I would not consider him to be an ""extreme"" chewer.  I thought that the stitching looked a little flimsy in the picture, but maybe it was strong thread or something - it is a pull toy after all it should be pretty tough - so I gave it a try.  My dog loved the toy, but after 2 days of pulling and chewing on it - he liked the strap as much as the chew toy, the strap broke not only at the part that held the toy, but the loop where you put your hand - and my dog didn't even chew on that part - it just gave way.  When looking at it, the thread they used looked like the same grade that I would use to sew a button on to my shirt.  I would expect some sort of reinforced stitching, or industrial grade thread/cord, but this was just very poorly made.  I would love to have a quality version of this toy, but this is not it.  Idea is great, execution is terrible.  I would not recommend this toy to anyone",0
"rhinestones keep falling out but it is sturdy and plenty of ""bling-bling"". The stitching also keeps coming loose. Right priced compared to other collars at other pet stores.",0
"This product did not fit snuggly in my electrical socket, so was sitting at a slight angle when it very nearly caught fire! The inner part was all black & melted, and it was smoking. Thank goodness I didn't leave it unattended with my cats home alone.",0
"Best cat treat, because they love it and it's healthy. My cat used to have tummy problems with bouts of diarrhea and lethargy. We took her to the vet, who gave us medicine. But this cat refuses to eat anything wet, and she's huge so force feeding was not an option. So delivering the medicine was impossible. I also heard things like pumpkin and baby food helps, which is also wet unfortunately. We give her these treats about once a day, and her poop problems are well managed.

Yes, the formula has changed. But my cat actually loves the crumbles. She loves anything that's crumbly. She'll dust her paw in the crumbles and licks it off. I'm guessing the old formula was too hard to chew for older cats, so I'm glad they changed it, as our cats are getting old.",1
"Opening too small, Cant use lid",0
"These are awful, they would not stay on the tubing. They were totally useless.",0
Disappointed as usually ruffwear has great items. Bought it for my dog who just had surgery on her CCL and I adjusted it and put it on her and it is DEFINITELY not for lifting as I've read bc it has zero support around the belly and it moves /shifts on the dog so that it's at an angle which would only hurt my dog even more if I attempted to lift her or even assist her. Very disappointed as this was not cheap.,0
I have two shiba inus I went by the brand FURminator as I have to other brushes and they are fantastic. I honestly do not know what this brush would work with because it is simply to flexible.,0
"We bought this for our extra tall 160 pound great dane, and it works perfectly.  Have not run into any bloat issues.  The bowls are good quality and easy to clean.

Removed 1 star because the frame itself is lightweight, and is easily moved around by a hungry pup with a fresh bowl of food.  Recommend some anti slide pads under the feet, or locking it in place somehow.",1
"I loved this product at first but then three months in it stopped working - the fountain barely works anymore - I have cleaned it and followed all the instructions still no good - sadly I will have to throw it out and try a different product - I just loved how much water it did hold and that it filtered the water for my pups

UPDATE: I had the item replaced to give it another chance and now this one broke. Not worth the money. Will never order again",0
My small 22 lb Spaniel had both squeakers out of this within 10 minutes - The toy is cute though (or was),0
It works.,1
HAPPY with the shampoo.,1
"We have a Cat-It water fountain that had the pump go out. Thanks to another reviewer who used this pump to replace the one in their fountain with success I decided to get this one over the one Cat-It sells. Fits perfectly and works great! This one has a standard plug which is a plus since the Cat-It pump had an adapter plug which was a true faulty piece of junk from the get-go. Only thing with this standard plug vs. the adapter plug is that you can't use the cord cover on the bucket, but a moot point for me. Happy with this purchase as our Cat-It has been pumping water as it should since replacing with this pump.",1
"It is an absurdly small package of gravel for the expense, two of these bags did not cover the bottom of a three gallon tank.",0
"Meat, that is. ""Meat"" is a mighty big umbrella-- the term covers a lot of different creatures. Makes you wonder. And it isn't even the first ingredient-- good dog foods have a solid protein source listed first.",0
"While I know from the reviews that this product has worked really well for some pet owners, I can honestly say that I've noticed no change in either of my rescue dogs, one who suffers from separation anxiety and the other who has some separation anxiety and general noise anxiety. I'll be trying something different.",0
Another great dog treat. Great for training.,1
These filters for the water fountain Drinkwell waterfall are reasonably priced and they work great have to clean once every two weeks add fresh water daily!,1
Terrible sizing ordered an XL could seriously fit my rabbit instead of my dog. Tried sending back but told me I would lose 30%. Very unhappy not to mention I got 2 more coats coming soon,0
"The spindle is made of plastic. Day 1, it worked OK on lettuce. Day 2, as soon as I put anything tougher than that in the bowl (shredded chicken) along with the lettuce, the teeth on the handle shredded and broke. This part should be made of metal. Otherwise this was bound to happen. Useless. Don't waste your money.",0
does not fit right,0
Quality material and made well.  But my cats will not play with them.,1
Absolutely awful. Zero absorbency. Must use 5-6 on top of each other to get the same benefit of 1 WeeWee pad. Do not buy.,0
Vet recommended for my older dog and I can see a difference in her ability to get up and down since I started using.,1
"Some screw holes weren't perfectly aligned. One screen came with a small part pulled away from the frame. We fixed it. Have this for our reptile. Very spacious. I ordered the extra large 24x24x48........they sent me something about 3 ft tall (36"") not 48 and the length and width are about 14 to 15"" (not 24). This is not the extra large. 103 dollars for this??? Very unhappy with the quality especially for the price. I agree with another buyer, not good for chameleons. I too assumed this product would be good but i was wrong. Im stuck with this now.",0
"This toy is a GREAT concept.  Both my cats were curious and wanted to play, but ran away when they heard the noise!",0
my dogs are happy.,1
"Not only did it not fit in the space I needed it for, but the gate itself is bent or deformed and won't work in ANY space because the gate can't reach the other side to close! My husband said he would try to bend it but he couldn't make any promises. We bought this gate for my father in law for Christmas and it worked, and we have the extra tall version and it's great. Very disappointed with this purchase =(.",0
"This brand runs about three sizes TOO SMALL and does not say so in the description portion of this item, It's also made cheaply and looks like it would fray within one week. I didn't bother to return, as I purchased the Puppia Soft harness which is true to size and an outstanding make and fit for my 3.5 year old Pug.",0
worked good,1
"My cats ignore this, which is a little odd because I bought it specifically because it had natural fur/hair on it. The hair is much more coarse than I expected; perhaps that's a deterrent?",0
"I got this for Christmas. It seemed like a good idea by looking at the box, but it's very low quality. It broke while I was assembling it (unscrewing the cap broke the legs attached to the base instead of the cap coming off).",0
"I am totally disappointed with this product and will never buy it again.  First of all, the urine stays pooled on top of the litter!  It stays there for quite a while (at least 10 minutes but it could be much longer) before finally being absorbed.  Then it never clumps hard.  Finally, my cats don't like it.  One refuses to use it entirely.  I will go back to the original Arm & Hammer Clump and Seal which is hard-clumping, and the best litter product I've ever found.",0
"I rescued my girl, Daisy, 11 1/2 years ago. She is very particular about her toys and will only play with these type of balls. Ten years ago, they could be easily found in various pet stores, but have since become more & more difficult to locate. I was thrilled when I searched online and came across them. Daisy goes through 1 ball per month. When I say ""goes through"" them, I mean she plays really hard. Not only does she play soccer with them, but bites & carries them around too. After about a month, the rubber does start to come apart, so I throw them away from fear that she could ingest pieces. I recently ordered 60 (15 packs with 4 balls in each) of them for her. She reassures me it was the best money I could have ever spent every time I see her batting them around the house!",1
Great product and I have given to my dogs for two years. excellent.,1
My dog and my cat hated it they will not even come near it. When turned on the motor is so loud it sounds like a vibrator and the vibrations are so strong they don't like it up against their nail. Tried to used it once never touched it again. Waste of money to me. They should make smaller sizes with smaller motors for smaller dogs.,0
"Teeth of the blade too small and too dense. Very difficult to cut the hair, not that sharp.",0
"After shopping around online and in pet stores, I have found this to be a GREAT price, the quality is good, nice hardy buckles and stiff leather. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small, I ordered a 22"" for my lab and it fits like her old 20"". It may stretch out being leather, we'll see.
I recommend this collar, very nice.",1
So far so good.,1
Great value.,1
"A stray super sweet kitty my client would feed but not allow in the house was the impetus for my purchase.  I really felt sorry of it. Well, Miss Kitty wouldn't have anything to do with it for months and months.  It just sat on an outside bench.  She would sit/sleep right next to it, but no amount of coaxing or even treats could get her to stay in it for more than 2 seconds.  Then one day all of a sudden she started getting inside it and is now using it consistently.",1
Hardly makes bubbles at all.  I will probably have to replace it soon.,0
"Missing the measuring scoop, and the dosage is not stated, thus I have not been able to use the product yet.  Disappointed.",0
Our cat is picky.  Sometimes don't even like this.,1
"i returnet this my dog take and go directy to emegency and i spend 800 , thanks i return this to you please refun my money",0
"This is the only dog harness that makes my lab mix not pull!! It is amazing =) I was afraid of falling, especially with the cold/icy weather coming up, so I wanted to get something soon and this worked! I have seriously tried 4 other 'no pull' harnesses before and this is the least awkward (I don't like the ones that attach in front or around the face) and works the best. Thanks Amazon and Sporn!",1
I am so happy to have found this.  I have been paying almost twice as much at pet smart.  This one is even better quality!,1
"The product itself is fabulous for treating hot spots effectively, which is why I was purchasing more since my previous one expired, which I had for over 3 years prior to expiration.

However, this purchase through Amazon in July 2016 arrived today with a bottle that expires in October 2016, less than 3 months from now.

I understand that technically the product isn't expired at the time of sale, but a product only usable for less than 90 days isn't what I thought I was buying and is useless to me. I was expecting a fresh product.

Needless to say, it will be going back.",0
I would love this even more if they had the opening for the middle seat belt-- I can't use it when having 3 kids across the back!  I keep this in my car at all times being that my dogs go with us for rides frequently but I always have to remove it when having 3 kids in the back.  This is a pain but I can deal with it as I like the seat cover!,1
This product really did nothing to help get rid of the odor or stains in my carpet.  Maybe the odor and stains were just so heavily soaked in that the product wouldn't been able to help.,0
"Been feeding this to my chihuahua for eight years now. I stopped for a few weeks to do a raw food diet and oh my did I regret it. $400 at the vet later and went right back to Royal as it never did me or my baby wrong. She loves it! She has always maintained a healthy weight, never a health problem, and doctor was so impressed she still had all her teeth at this age. Great nutrition plus hardly smelly stools makes for one happy owner. Highly recommended!",1
"I purchased this specific cat climber based on decent reviews but when I built mine it is very shaky. My cat loves to sleep on the top level but we had to reinforce the second level with wooden dowels to make it more sturdy. Also, the two circular pieces of the climber are way too small for a full grown cat as well as the hammock! Lastly, at no fault to anyone specifically, the carpeted covered climbers are better for scratching that the faux fur. Due to those reasons of dissatisfaction, I would recommend a different climber and I think my cats agree!",0
My 1 year old Cocker Spaniel mix had this guy torn to shreds within minutes of getting her paws on this. Very cute chew toy but not durable as advertised.,0
ANNIS LOVES THEM,1
excellent purchase. very good quality and well made. bought 2. my dogs instantly loved it. easy to wash and keep clean.,1
It was too small,0
We have a Golden Retriever.  This was much to small to fit her.,0
"These stairs are very light, so they move around if not anchored or if used by a dog weighing more than 10lbs. Each stair is not very deep, so also a problem if your dog has longer legs. Works for my Dachshund but not so well for my Cavalier.",1
Combined this with other litter.,1
"Very pretty, BUT it smells of a very strong chemical - such as formaldehyde - it's so strong that I'm ""airing"" it out, in the garage, it's been 3 days and some the of the smell has deteriorated, but still strong.  Not sure if I'm going to be able to us this for my pet.",0
"While this may be a good product by ingredients, it will not work if your dog will not take it.  I have three dogs and none of them will take it.
I tried to melt it in water and the smell was terrible and then I new why they wouldn't take it.  Finally, I put it between two paper towels and
crushed it with a mallet and that worked.  However, if I buy chewable, I like for it to be that easy.  Also, I cannot tell it has helped their aches and pains.  I will not order again.",0
"I have an Aqueon QuietFlow 55/75, and I was worried that my guppies or guppy fry might get caught in this. 1 doesn't fully encompass the water suction, so I made a hole in 1 and added another on the bottom. It fits, It's working as intended. It came a day earlier than expected which I appreciate. Thank you.",1
The description is misleading. I thought I was receiving three hug & kicks only to receive one. And it didn't last long before the stuffing was exposed & I was afraid for my cat to have it.,0
"I really wanted to love this! But my cats certainly do not... It is attractive for a large cat toy and looks like a irobot vacuum that was designed by Apple or something. Kittens would probably love this thing but my 2 intelligent cats who are a little over 2 years old could care less. One of them stopped looking at it after a few minutes while the other one will run to it from anywhere in the house hen she hears it turn on but then literally sits in front of it watching it until the timer shuts it off. That is the only good thing about this is the shut off timer! I love not having to waste batteries. Other than that it is too slow, the string is too short, and the humming seems to entertain them more than anything else about it.",0
"Got a small for a Shih Tsu....couldn't use it, the costume was waaay too big & kept falling off.",0
"stopped ordering this product, my dogs will no longer eat anything that is mixed with it, I guess it is because dogs really have no use at all for fruit and veggies, they are not species appropriate foods. They stick with raw meat and bones.",0
Cats love it!,1
"Great while it lasted...which was 37 days, 7 days after the return window closed.  Then my little 8 pound dog managed to pull the ribbon loose from the retractor inside and almost got run over.",0
"I have been buying these bully sticks for nearly a full year now because my dog LOVES them. However, the past three bags I have ordered have been below the quality I have come to expect from this brand. The first time we got a bag of very dark, hollow bully sitcks we assumed it was a bad batch, fed our dog the ones he would accept and ordered a new bag. When another bag came and we had the same results, we returned it despite the company telling us there was nothing wrong with their product. This most recent bag we have gotten just contains hollow sticks. With one chomp down on bully stick my dog can shatter this chew, which is supposed to be long lasting. I cannot stress enough how much my dog absolutely loves these bully sticks...when they're how they're supposed to be. The last three bags we have received has him turning his nose up at this favorite treat. Time to find a new brand.",0
Dog pays no attention other than a curious look should be much louder,0
"The crate is the right size, metal could be sturdier.",1
"We have fed this salmon food to our WGSD for over a year and have been very satisfied until this new bag.  She has had explosive diarrhea.  I have stopped feeding Taste of the Wild for the moment and switched to rice with Fage greek yogurt.  Has anyone else had this happen with their shipment??  I will update after getting this under control, then give a test bit of TOTW food again. The original bag has been thrown out already so I have no batch/expiration info.",0
"This kitty tree was delivered in a timely manner, and assembled pretty easily.  It instructions are a bit brief, but they seemed to suffice.  I kinda wish the covering fur was a bit more durable, but our kitty seems to like it OK.  The rope claw posts seem to be one of her favorite features so far.",1
This product is just what you are looking for if you want to keep your pets in a location. The gate is sturdy and constructed well.,1
Poor quality,0
"Love that it has a beep, vibrate and shock option.  Don't have to go over 3 for my pup to get attention.  The beep annoys her more than the shock so we keep it on that for the most part.  Easy to use, battery lasts about 2 days.",1
"Just like the expensive ones purchased at dog shows.  Medium weight but strong and attractive.  Lovely gold color.  Good functional show collar for purposes in which you really want your canine pal to ""shine!""  Maybe not the ideal walking collar as it is a choke collar unless  you have a very well trained dog that won't pull against it.",1
there are better ways to accomplish the same thing,0
My mixed terrier loves this toy.  Keeps him busy for hours if we keep it tight.  Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is I'm going to have to order my 2nd one after 5 months.  Dog chews it up over time.  At least it's a cheap toy.,1
"got this in a timely manner, it is as it was stated in the description. I haven't use it yet, but it is what it is :D",1
Bad stuff,0
We had a couple of these and both began SMOKING as well as overheating! Not safe at all.,0
"Like the many other comments here, the faucet adapter is an odd size - it will not fit most faucets, and it took some effort to find an adapter that fits (at Loew's).  The adapter is very soft plastic, and it will strip very easily.  The vacuum is very weak (I have a 55 gallon tank).  I use it to fill the tank, but not to drain, as the vacuum just doesn't do the job.",0
"I thought this would be perfect for my messy Miss Kitty who pushes food out of her bowl.  And it would have been except I received it on 9 July 2014 and probably washed and used it that day.  Today, 3 August 2014, 25 days later, its being retired because on the 23rd day of normal use, it has a big chunk of ceramic out of the upper edge.  Irks me to pieces.  These nice hand made or dubiously made articles look really good but DO NOT withstand normal use.  Oh well, back to the Petsmart shelves I suppose.",0
Steps seem adequate for weight of dog.  Carpet could be a lot better.  Dogs are resisting but its only day 1.  Im sure with enough treats I will get them to cooperate.  Fingers crossed.,1
"This costume is super cute. I received my ""large"" in the mail and it looks like it would fit a teacup size dog. The costume is so small and does not fit my medium size dog. I am very disappointed. Hoping i can exchange for larger costume for next year. :(",0
Works great. Easy to use.,1
This is the best thing ever! No more in home accidents! My dog loves to use it on my living room carpet but now that's over. It stays on and holds poop and liquids. In my opinion it's worth the money.,1
I can't get near him with that bottle in the room so I give it a one and write off the charges.,0
"Loves it, both my dogs",1
"My dog loves this food.  his poop is firm and regular, he is very high energy and his coat is shiny and full.  His check-ups always go well, the vet always says he is healthy.  That's all I can ask for in dog food, right?",1
It is the only treat my 20 year old cat will eat.,1
dog did not have much interest in the nylon ones.. the other one is some kind of hard biscut she devoured in under 1 minute,0
Great,1
"Our 90 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime - a 5 month old puppy of the same breed are both relentless - hardcore chewers. Thier jaws were designed by Satan.

This said, I know when buying virtually any soft or stuffed dog toy that it's the equivalent of pre-mediated murder - for the toy not the dogs! However, Tuffy toys are without question one of the most entertaining line of dog toys we've ever had. Both for the dogs and ourselves. When our oldest, Harley was a puppy he had this odd habit of chewing on seams or pulling strings out of anything from pillows to upholstery until the entire thing was unraveled.

We thought this was a puppy phase and that he would grow out of it. Well, it's six years later and we're still waiting. He does this with everything, including our bedding - which is why our prized 1,200 thread count sheets look like swiss cheese. So we know when going into buying a soft or stuffed toy that it doesn't stand a chance for a long healthy life. Harley is going right for that seam - and with deadly accuracy.

I've bought more Tuffy toys on Amazon then I can remember. What's left of most of them is lost somewhere in that endless void of half chewed nylabones, Kongs, tennis balls and once adorable stuffed bunnies and other cute kritters that now resemble road kill.

So, I decided to crank up the crazy once again and bought the Mega Ring - I love that Tuffy rates their toys on a Tuffy scale.
Thos toy was an immediate hit! Our dogs went bezerk and we sat back and laughed. The hole in the center is perfect for you to grab onto and get in on the fun. If you have one dog or many - this is a must have toy. The material is great, thick and strong and the tiger print is a hoot. It's very well made and strong enough for ""normal"" dogs.

Unless of course you live in our world -  where the only toy that would have lasting power would be a cinder block. Life is short so if they have fun for a few weeks or months it's worth every cent. And the fun that our dogs have with this toy is well worth the price - even though we know that for the poor Tuffy, it's days are numbered.

5 Paws Up!",1
I am afraid my dogs will chip their teeth.  And make sure you don't kick it - it will brake bones.,0
"It crumbles quite fast leaving a lot of crumbs into the substrate. Even with a feeder dish, the crumbs will just easily float out of it. It's really messy after the shrimps are done. Water changes becomes more often.",0
"I was wary of this product before I bought it.  It seems like an awful lot of money for a plastic hose, but the raving reviews convinced me the investment was worth it.

We hooked it up without a problem.  It was so simple my 9 year old son could do it (though I connected the hoses to make sure they were tight).  I cleaned out one tank and filled it 3/4 of the way before leaving my son to finish up and do the second tank.  I have very limited mobility, so when he was comfortable using it, I went back to bed (15 feet away and within sight of the bathroom where he was).

Everything was going so well, we really couldn't have been more satisfied.  Then the hose blew off the adapter on the sink. I mean BLEW! It flew at least 3 feet in an arc that soaked half the bathroom instantly.  Anyone with turtles knows you have to be very careful cleaning the tanks because there's so much electricity involved (basking lamp, sun lamp, filter/pump, water heater), so when that hose blew, my son is lucky he wasn't electrocuted!!! The power strip was turned off but not unplugged.  With 2 tanks, we have 8 cords plugged in there!

He cleaned up the mess, reconnected the hose, turned on the faucet, and POOF it went again. And again.  After the 3rd time he cleaned up the mess (by then we had unplugged the power strip and soaked 3 beach towels), I struggled back to my feet, grabbed my cane and hobbled over.  This time I connected the hose, making sure it was as tight as it will go (without cracking the adapter at least).

Still, every time I turned on the faucet the hose flew off!  I even tried a flow so low it wouldn't create suction.  This is a piece of junk.  Don't waste your money only to risk electrocuting yourself or your aquatic pets!

THANK YOU Amazon for providing the website!  Here is what it says - ""Thank you for submitting your Report to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).""",0
What I expected,1
"It's a bit heavier than necessary, I think. And be careful of your fingers when folding it - it's easy to get pinched or worse. Dog goes up it great.",1
"This little device is pretty helpful with ""spot cleaning"" waste from aquarium. The only complaint is that when I suck up dirty water and turn this device sideways, it'll leak water from where the rubber part meets the plastic.

UPDATE:
I've had this device for a few months and it falls apart every time I use it, and the dirty water leaks everywhere from where the bulb attaches to the siphon. Not worth the money.",0
"We have a terrible problem with one or both of our dogs killing the grass with their urine.  Hoping to avoid following them around with a bucket of water each time I let them out to relieve themselves, which is difficult considering I'm having to remember where dog #2 went after I flush out dog #1's spot, or undertaking the process of training them to go #1 and #2 in a specific spot in the yard, I purchased Dog Rocks. We're on our 4th week of using them (the only water source for our dogs has the rocks in it), and it does not appear that the rocks are working. Unfortunately for me, the grass is still being killed.  Maybe the kill spots seem smaller, but that's likely me just trying to be hopeful.",0
Not what I was hoping for. The bells were way too loud (maybe I'm just sensitive?) and one of the sets fell off. Hoping the company is easy to deal with on the return side. Wish me luck!,0
It lasted a week.,0
Great product. Great price.,1
When I first began purchasing these they were fresh and good quality. I had them on subscription every month. The past two are terrible. Dark as though burned. I threw them away. See photos,0
Product was not as described,0
"These are your typical compressed rawhide bones. The 4.5"" is a little on the small side for larger sized dogs, but is perfect for small to smaller medium sized dogs. The compressed rawhide treats take much longer for my dogs to devour than regular rawhide, and they love chewing them more than they do their rubber or plastic toys. It keeps them occupied for at least 30-45 minutes, or about 20 for my larger dog with more powerful chompers. Still better than the 2 minutes they would take on a regular rawhide! They love these treats, so I love them too. Worth every penny.",1
"If it was 10 stars... I'd give 10!!!!!!!  My cat and i in love with this item.
Good quality! Easy to assemble. Stable. Strong.
I do recommend.",1
"This feeder is not reliable on its feeding intervals. Another major flaw, it only took a couple days before my cat figured out how to get extra food by pawing at the chute.",0
"My cat went nuts for this, which is odd because he won't eat any other treats!",1
"I usually am too lazy to write reviews, but this product was an exception. I was using a regular stroller for my senior dog, but she kept trying to
jump out, which made it unsafe and very frustrating. This stroller is exactly what I needed for my little Sophie, she is safely tucked away with the
clamp secured and I don't have to worry about a zipper getting stuck. It is fairly small, but fits her perfectly,(she is a 11 lb Peekapoo). It is lightweight, easy to fold down and put back together, the material is very nice. It does not come with any cushion inside, but I just placed a small
blanket and that works fine. Sophie seems to enjoy her ride and I just love it, plus she looks adorable in it. If you have a small pet and need a great stroller for them, this is a great deal.",1
Cat loves it,1
"I like how this spray smells, but before it dries it feels gross and your hands get sticky.",1
"again, another waste of money",0
"This leash is holding up well, we got the matching collar and have a stylish puppy.  The clip is well made and the spring is still closing the clasp as it should after 3 months.",1
My dog really liked these and they were a good price for the quality.  I will definitely buy it again.,1
I have two large dogs that absolutely love to lay on these outside for a sunbath.  I love them which is why I bough this as a replacement cover for the one damaged by the sun after 6 years outside.,1
warning- it only works if it is positioned well below the water level in the aquarium.  Even a small leak will eventually drain the aquarium.,0
Not his favorite but he likes thrm,1
The cover is nice however the sizing is not accurate. It fits half of my cool bed but not the other half. I bought a large cool bed do thought the larges would match up but I should of read the order more carefully. I need to return it somehow,0
"I have (7) little dogs all under 7 lbs and I wouldn't trust them on this ""pressboard"" step! I should have read there were more negative than positive comments but the price, obviously too good to pass up, was the case of you get what you pay for. I paid $20 and my husband put it together quickly and the cover did go on easily. Besides the cheap material, it is not high enough to suite anything; not enough to reach the lowest window, definitely not enough to reach a bed or even a chair! So the flimsy material and short height make this useless. Perfect for a ferret, gerbil or small rodent to play on, just fine, critters with weigh at or less than 1 lb. No use sending back because my husband reinforced the steps with actual wood and built on another step to make it high enough for use inside the house, now I don't worry about it collapsing on my dogs and hurting them.",0
Extremely pleased with construction quality of leashes.  Exceeded my expectations given the very reasonable price.  Hope this company expands their SKU's. We certainly would be customers.,1
Easy to fold up and perfect size :),1
Horrible..liberal agenda product,0
IT WAS AWFUL.i HAVE FOUND AN AWFUL LOT OF TICKS ON BOTH OF MY CATS,0
"Didnt work for us, but to be fair we  have REALLY bad fleas. Still finding a lot of fleas on them and its been a week, I don't think its making any difference. I don't like the smell, its very strong but my husband likes the smell.",0

"This kitty play cube is not well made or durable enough. Which is so very disappointing because my cat loved it for the first couple of weeks, but by the third week it was ripped and misshapen.  Actually, I would like my money refunded.",0
"I'm so disappointed. I bought this to replace my fluval aquasky that is too small for this tank only to find that the light I already have is brighter. I also bought the ramp timer to help automate the lights better, but once you start dimming the lights they blink rapidly until they go all the way off. Disappointed and frustrated don't even begin to describe how I feel. I spent 4 months saving only to feel like the extra hours and scrimping were a huge waste.",0
my two LOVE these!!,1
Some of this shampoo came to me with a previous foster dog for her skin issues.  It helped her if I bathed her once a week or every other week.  She for sure got some relief from itching with it.  I now use it for my dog with skin issues and it has a wonderful scent that stays awhile (until my dog rolls in something at the dog park the next day!).  It seems to give him relief for his itching without drying him out.,1
dog ate it well,1
Showed up with threaded ends and no fittings very disappointed no side shot on pic to see can't use it now until I order fittings for $8 which take price of this to $27 filter,0
"It didn't help with my dog, his allergies got wirse! :(",0
"I needed a new bed for the standard large metal crate I have and this works great. It is flat enough as to not be cumbersome inside of the crate yet the bolster gives my pups a place to lay their heads if they want. The bed itself is not very thick, but if your dogs like to circle and gather their bed/blanket, this gives them the ability to do so.",1
"Excellent product. My dog loves it.  The vet is happy. BUT my most recent shipment arrived 1/17/2018 with a ""best by"" date of 3/24/18. Amazon is replacing them, but they never should have been shipped.  Check when your package arrives - hopefully this was a one-time mistake.",1
my 3 birds love these. They sleep in them at night,1
i have a hedgehog so he's fine with this but THERE IS NO WAY A CAT WOULD FIT IN THIS... very very tiny kittens maybe,0
Got it for my cats as I was leaving for a long weekend and it was the best thing ever! Till this day I use it for them daily as they love drinking from there.,1
"As a nail trimmer, these do a great job.  They are very sharp.

As a quick detector, they leave a lot to be desired.  The readings are inconsistent.  A few times, as a test, I placed the trimmer as far up on the nail as I could go.  It told me it was okay to cut.  This was on clear nails and black nails.  Needless to say, I don't trust this nail trimmer.

Finally, I had a problem with the battery cover popping off every few cuts.  This became annoying.",0
Our dog needs this daily since she has had (2) ACL surgeries.  We can tell she walks better when she takes this.,1
"Bought for our dog, but it works great on our cracking feet.",1
"Purchased for an 8lb Pomeranian who is not house trained. I use these with Pampers Size 2 diapers (with a hole cut out for the tail). These work great at preventing her from getting the diaper off or eating it (which she was doing frequently). So far she has not been able to chew through it or unhook the velcro. The Small size is ok for her, but verging on too small, even for her tiny waist. Good quality product at a reasonable price.",1
My two adult cats took a smell and walked away. Maybe better for kittens,0
Easy to clean cats like it. I do not it leaks from somewhere or when you add water. Not sure have tried everything. Have a rubber mat to catch the water. Gave 4 stars cause cats really do like it.,1
"my dogs like these, but they prefer the flavored ones",1

"very unhappy. even though it's listed as a 4 oz bottle, the picture shows a much bigger bottle. I would have never purchased 4 oz for this much. Very deceitful. I will not be patronizing your company again and will be returning this product.",0
Perfect,1
"We have had this bed for about 2 weeks and are very impressed and pleased with the product. Our Great Dane loves it!! We have purchased several dog beds from other companies in the past and have always had to replace it after a year or so. I really feel like this bed will last, plus it comes with a warranty. This bed is very sturdy and is a true orthopedic bed. It is very thick. We ordered the bed  in the tan color, which we like. It is perfect for our large dog and I couldn't be happier. Our Dane seems so comfortable resting on it. We did not go with the headrest edition, but if we get another dog, I think I would like to try that one out as well. I really cannot say enough great things about this bed. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but this bed exceeded my expectations. I HIGHLY recommend this bed for your did. You will not be disappointed!",1
"If your dog is an escape artist, you need this!  We have two rescues who would love to roam free like they did when they were homeless.  Our little girl escaped from four different harnesses.  We must have spent more than $150 trying different types.  Each one we bought seemed more secure, but she figured a way to slip out of each of them.  She is easily excited by kids on bicycles, cars, other dogs, leaves, bees, etc.  Her escape was always so fast, that we couldn't figure out how she did it.  I told my husband I needed to find her a ""straight jacket"", and this harness is as close as you can find.  I always worried when I walked her before this harness.  Not now, there is no way she is going to escape, and she doesn't seem to mind it at all. It adjusts wonderfully to her tiny proportions (she's 10 lbs, 17 inch chest and wears an XXS), and she automatically lifts her right leg to get into and out of the harness. Recently, our boy started to escape a harness we had been using for a year.  We bought him a small one of these, however, it ended up being a little too large, but we like the harnesses enough
that we bought him an X-Small and it adjusts to fit him perfectly (he's appx. 20 lbs, 22 inch chest). If you love your escape artist dog babies, buy this harness!  UPDATE: We just bought another for our boy.  He pulls (very hard) on the leash and the fabric holding the hook on the harness was getting frayed.  We like these well enough to continue buying them despite the wear.  We bought it for future use-we were afraid we wouldn't be able to find one again when the time comes to retire his old one.",1
"Less expensive than Walmart, but the ones I received were hard and crunchy, unlike Walmart's which are soft and chewy.  My large dogs didn't mind, but my small dog did not like how hard they were.",0

good for small dogs,1
Good treats!,1
They're great in theory but our Spaniel pup (1year) has destroyed/eaten at least 5 of them  :(,0
They are not curved at all. Also do not seem to be sharp at all.,0
"I'll start by saying, if you're going through a wall, with vinyl siding, you will need the extension kit. Because of the uneven surface of the siding, I removed it, and made a wood frame for inside the house, and sealed the outside with silicone. It seems to insulate pretty well, even with one flap removed. I do have a wind barrier around my deck, but it isn't insulated. It was -10 degrees here in New York, and it wasn't horrible by the door. It would have been much warmer with both flaps, but my Boston was having issues with the 2 flap system. Both animals got it down within a few days.",1
Cats are obligate carnivores and need meat to live a healthy life. Anyone feeding their cat this should reevaluate their priorities. If you love your cat and care about their health you will not feed them this crap.  -happily vegan for 12 years but my cat deserves to eat what he was designed to digest.,0
I love this super cute pet carrier! My 7 lb Chihuahua fits perfect in it. Love everything about it!,1
Do not suggest for using this running with a large dog. Both hooks for hold the leash on broke. And now the front pocket to hold my cell phone is coming undone now on the search for a new heavy duty actual quality belt.,0
Didn't work at all!!  Dog was able to stand and sit on it. Don't buy.,0
"Too small to actually go around a scratching post, maybe better for some sort of thick table leg or something",0
"I consider myself a generally aware person but this purchase made me feel like a total fool. I bought this bootie on the recommendation of my Father, a veterinarian, for my bulldog, who is allergic to the grass. I intended to buy four boots- for ALL her paws, for her to wear when I walk her outside. Well- the box contained one bootie.
I'm not sure why this wasn't clear to me upon purchase- I guess I didn't imagine someone would actually only purchase one bootie for their dog.
So it will cost me $80 to buy all four booties for my pup? I don't think so- I will buy all four elsewhere at one time.
I'm disappointed to say the least. I pretty much buy everything from amazon and I take responsibility for not reading between the lines on this one, but again- it makes no sense that it would only be one bootie...and for $20????
Come on. Disappointed.",0
This has really helped this winter with our elderly frail outdoor cat. I was worried about him lasting the winter this year. We keep a large wood box outside with blankets in it but I knew that wouldn't be enough this time. We saw a suggestion on line to use this pad with a large cooler as an outdoor shelter for animals. We cut an opening in the side of the cooler and put padding and a small fluffy cat bed in it. I place the heat pad on top of the padding under the pet bed and it has done the job! Our cat comes out to eat and goes back in to warm up. I have left it plugged in for weeks now and I stuck my hand in to see if it was still working and it is. It snowed last night and his little shelter is just fine. We keep it close to the house plugged in on our deck under the awning. You won't have to worry about your animal if you use this. It has worked great!!!,1
My cat loves it:),1
"Male came dead, female came barely alive and died the next day",0
Not sturdy at all....you get what you pay for I guess.,0
"Bought these to bait a live trap for the terrorist bunnies savaging our garden. They showed no interest in it at all.

May be wonderful for domesticated rabbits. I would rather keep a tasmanian devil as a pet, personally.

For my admittedly limited purposes, this was not what the doctor ordered.",0
"My big girl loves her new bed! It took a couple days for her to transition. She is an 11 year old Great Dane and has achy joints & hips. She sleeps through the night without repositioning periodically and even snores louder than before receiving her new mattress. It was pricey but considering how much I have spent on other ""orthopedic"" mattresses over the years, I wish I'd known about your bed 11 years ago.",1
Would give 0 stars...bought 2 weeks ago 7 of these only one left fall apart quick not suitable for large dogs maybe better for teacup,0
"Did not like these collars. I put one on ""the barker"" and within 5min it was set off by another dog play growling 2 feet away.",0
The cans were all dented and in bad shape.,0
Only one zapper actually zaps. They both beep and vibrate.,0
"This is needed for grooming, good quality",1
There are no wheels attached or included. Infact there are no place to attach wheels. The lid falls off when it's opened. The container tips easily.,0
Our dog is very fond of treats and she loves these. I think she would eat the entire bag if she could. The product seems to be very high quality which would explain why it is rather pricy. Because the product is freeze dried raw meat it is important to remember to wash your hands after  handling & to make sure your pet drinks plenty of water after eating unless food is rehydrated first.,1
"My dog will not drink water with this in it. I tried very small amounts at first to get him used to it, gradually increased to prescribed
amount. But no dice, would not drink the water. So..no good for the dog, no good for me.
Also, Im Not suggesting they add some phony flavor to this. Seems most dogs have no problem.",0
Cheaply made,0
"I bought this because it was advertised as a coil that would retract and not tangle.  However, I put my dog on this for ten minutes, and when I returned, each of those coils was wrapped around his foot so tightly that he barked when I tried to undo it.  I assumed it was a fluke, but when I tried again, and stayed with my dog, the same thing happened.",0
My guinea pig is exclusively fed OxBow hay and pellets and he is now EIGHT YEARS OLD.  I didn't even know guinea pigs lived that long. But I truly think between genetics and good healthy food my old man pigs have thrived.,1
"On the recommendation of a cat expert, I started buying Dr. Elsey's crystals at the local Pet big box store to help fix a problem with our Kitty going places she shouldn't. As part of a systematic program of issues we addressed, it really worked. (Meaning, if using this product is the only thing you change in your household, don't expect it to work miracles).

The local Pet big box discontinued Dr. Elsey's products, I guess because they were too useful or something- just like they discontinued Get Serious, the only rug spot cleaner worth a darn. But enough about them. This product sprinkled on top of typical clumping cat litter does the job, and for less overall money too.

Highly recommended.",1
My cats almost ate the whole package.  They love it.  Thanks.,1
i like it but my cat won;t go near it......oh well.....,0
"One of our dogs has this issue, so we tried this product with the hope it would help.  Unfortunately, it slowed her down somewhat, but didn't eliminate the problem.  When the treatment was finished, she was right back to her original appetite.  We did not reorder.  My sense is that it depends to a large degree on the dog.",0
I had to replace my cover and found this great replacement cover and it fits perfect!  Nice to know I can take off and wash it when it gets dirty!  I have a protective cover on the foam bedding part and so all is saved from ruins!  Thanks and I should get a few more to keep on hand!,1
"This harness fits my English Bulldog like a nicely made article of clothing. Unlike the usual harnesses out there, this one is soft and comfortable for her, while still being very secure.
I couldn't be more pleased with the quality. I've bought,and subsequently thrown away enough cheaply made harnesses to know the difference.
This one is great!",1
I don't put my horse on anything else.  This product works great for her.,1
Super easy to install - had it on in just a few minutes. I bought my 70 pound border collie a harnesss just for biking with the attachment and he gets all sorts of excited every time we get it out. I haven't had any trouble with it coming loose or my legs hitting it and i feel much safer with it than when I was holding the leash. My pup does get distracted but we haven't crashed yet and he's learning to stay on course. It does seem to pull on him even with two springs removed so I might look for a way to add more leeway without removing the last spring.,1
My dog wasn't too crazy about the biscuits. The large are too big for him.,0
This worked great on my lab who seems to have an allergy to fleas. My only complaint is how bad it smells. It's almost indescribable. Kind of a mixture of the smell of a doctor's office and a brand new sharpie. I try only to use it in the most ventilated room in the house because my family and other animals as well as the lab are bothered by it.,1
"Ordered 2 months ago, never heard a word, I had to go through Amazon with my question about where it is.. i received an e-mail stating they were out of stock, and should be in shortly.. Still haven't received it and who knows when i will. I would like to get my money back, should have bought it at Walgreens,I could have taken it home with me.. yes i am mad...",0
"Didn't really work for our cat. She generally loves treats, any treats, but would not go near these. Wouldn't eat them alone, or with any other food or treat. Literally, mix them in with other treats, she'll eat around them. Major bummer, as we were taking our cat on a cross-country trip and really needed something to help with anxiety and stress.",0
Very lightweight. Won't order again.,0
Junk. Went out within 4 months. Will not buy again.,0
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Tidy Cats breeze system!  I've had cats my whole life and I have always hated the smell of cat litter and the tracking of the litter all over the house.  This system changed all of that!  Even with 4 cats currently in my apartment there is NO cat litter smell.  I will never go back to cat litter!",1
"Nice design, but my 55lb irish setter & standard poodle mix ripped this apart in 10 minutes. Should not be considered a ""tough"" or ""strong"" toy - If you have a dog that destroys toys, stay away from this.",0
"Warning: the shipping makes this purchase more comparable to other cat trees I've priced in stores.

However, I still recommend this. In fact, we convinced my landlord to get one days after ours arrived!

This is a large, fairly study, cat tree that is delivered to your door. While the faux fur carpet is cheap, the wood is good. My husband even rearranged some of it and screwed multiple planks together without an issue. The carpet has not been an issue, though a few corners have been peeled off by my cat. We vacuum it regularly.

Who, by the way, LOVES this! The lower, center cat house wobbles and we've had to reinforce it. Otherwise, my large cat can run and jump on, off, through, and over it with no issues. It's about 6 feet, so my cat can get up high, which he loves. The perches are wide enough for him to lay, clean, and play.

While I wasn't happy about the misleading cost vs shipping, I still think it is an incredible deal for the money. I can always replace the carpet myself if my cat ever completely shreds it. :-)",1
"Size chart unclear. I returned the product, however if it had been a proper fit, I would have kept it. It wasn't available in the size and color I wanted.",0
"This thing is cheaply made, flimsy and kept falling apart. It does work decent enough though. The plastic is so thin that I am extremely careful handling it because it feels like it will break very easily. I had to put holes through the bottom plate for the tubes then I put zip ties through them to hold it together. I made it into a 3 star product.",0
"Works and the price compared to Frontline, Pet Armor, and Bayer substantial savings. My new go to pet protection..",1
Thanks,1
Nice for wreaths,1
"My cat loves this bed, the fleece pad seems kind of cheap but it is still a good buy. It came a few days before scheduled delivery and smelled like it had been packaged for a long time, but within a few hours that smell had disappeared.",1
Just what I needed! Works great for large areas and small dogs.,1
"I originally bought one to test it out with both of my cats. They loved it way more than any cat bed or cardboard box I've ever gave them, so much so that they fought over it. Needless to say I had to buy another one. While the original reason why I bought these were for travel reasons, like going to the vet, I keep them out because they love sleeping in them. It's a bonus, I guess lol",1
"Our senior kitty was starting to lose weight and was hungry all the time. We talked with our vet, and after her blood work came back normal, he suggested switching her to a senior diet where the food was minced.  She gobbles this up right away and her fur is very soft. She at least seems to be maintaining weight now.",1
Its ok too much juice!,1
"I am thoroughly disappointed with this product. The little plastic training toilet seats are much too small to use as a litter box, so in the training period my cats were trying to stay in the pan, but made a mess all over the floor. One of my cats never woud jump up on the toilet to go and the other one tried to but would make a mess that ended up with litter on the floor and in the toilet.
Since we only have one bathroom we would have to remove the training insert every time we needed to use the bathroom, which was pretty gross.  The experience was so bad that I gladly went back to a regular litter box - it is cleaner!",0
My one year old border collie is getting to be a very picky eater. Tried this but she would not touch. Will donate.,0
"Great leash.  Got the 6ft version, and in hindsight, probably would have gotten the 4ft version.  Build and finish appear to be great.  The metal clip is strong and I have no worries about it coming undone from our dog's harness.  Only thing to note, as another commenter has mentioned, is the size of the metal clasp.  If you harness has two metal rings that you attach your leash to, you may find that clipping the leash around both metal rings can be a bit tricky.  However, once I realized what was happening, it takes me half a second to do it now consistently.  You just have to arrange the two rings of the harness correctly (staggered and off center slightly from each other).  Great leash, and I am comforted knowing that if anything at all happens to it, it's covered under warranty.",1
The rabbits liked it but it unraveled so quickly it wasn't worth buying. I think they may have been more interested in the cardboard core!,0
Easy set up. Came in on time. Doesn't work for our escape artist the lock isn't really a lock.she can easily let herself out. :(,0
"Good match for harness.  Would have liked it to have a set option rather than two items, but was still good product",1
"This is okay but I like to have a way to open it to put it on the dog, rather than worrying about hurting him sliding it over his face and eyes.  .  I like the ones with a release much better..",0
Really small pig ears. I have to give my hound two at treat time,0
Cats prefer the real deal cat nip rather than the spray. I won't buy again.,0
"I haven't found my koi to be picky eaters, and they certainly enjoy this. It has kept them healthy, for the past six months since I've owned them and been using this product.

"The odor is so strong that my eyes watered and my nose stung, even after leaving the package open for a week. I cant use this product in my house. I don't know why the manufacturer thought this would be okay around humans and I wonder if it's toxic.",0
"My dog eats so fast that sometimes she gags on her food or even looses her breath. I have tried putting a ball in her food dish, which works to a degree but I thought this puzzle type toy would slow her down even more..and it does. Very noisy though. She does not try to take the blocks out with her mouth .. her mouth is too small, so she just scratches and hits the thing silly with her paws until the blocks go flying. It is very comical to watch but noisy. It does take her a little while to get thru her meal and she does not gag or loose her breath while eating. So I guess it works.",1
I got it in the mail today and I am very pleased! I got a size large because I have a 6 month old black lab and she is growing rapidly. This is adjustable so it fits a little loose when tightened all the way but she will grow into it. I highly recommend! Very durable fabric!,1
"This is a good product, I was skeptical of buying it but it has kept my non nuetured Hound dog home all but once which was my fault for leaving it on a low shock.
Well Anyways it was easy enough to install, i rented a edger like I read from other reviews which worked very well. The only thing that I have to complain about this product, which I am sure is not common, is that the collar shocks the dog before it warns, even though I have the settings right. I probably should call see if theyll send me a new collar.  I did not follow instructions for training the dog to often but he still learned. He was kinda of scared to go anyware except for his stoop for about a week but after a little while he started to move from his stoop a little more farther each day, now he knows his boundaries.",1

It is ok. My 4 months old puppy eats them but doesn't get too crazy about it compared to my home baked cookies.,1
"The LUFFY Coco Philippines Java Fern arrived in two days via Prime. It comes in a medium sized padded envelope; the plant itself is totally sealed within a plastic bag (see attached photos). It was obvious that there was some water/humidity in the bag to keep the plant relatively moist during transit.

The plant itself was exactly as described; easily 20 leaves with roots securely attached to part of an organic coconut husk. Unlike the picture for this product, the plants are bunched very tightly at the base rather than spread out on a large area like the picture shows. There is a surprisingly small but decent root structure. The leaves themselves ranged from two to just over six inches; there were a few obviously dying leaves but overall the plant looked good. I carefully examined the plant (leaves/roots/husk) for any unwanted bonus critters; but I didn't notice anything and everything looked clean.

The plant will float in your tank if not somehow secured to the bottom. I was able to easily do this by just placing a small amount of sand (I have use black sand versus gravel) on top of the organic coconut husk.

Unfortunately I am concerned about the overall health of the plant; not because of the seller, but rather because of the shipping. The plant shipped in two days (via Amazon Prime); however the weather here in the Midwest has been very hot and sunny; in fact it hit 94 degrees the day that the Java Fern was delivered. The plant ships via the US Postal Service, and as with any shipper I am sure none of the trucks used were air conditioned.  The plastic package the fern was in was very warm to the touch; and when I carefully cut open the packaging you could feel very hot/humid air escaping the packaging. As you can see from the pictures in the tank the leaves are not the beautiful green as in the product pictures; rather a subdued green/brown. The plant seems strong; so hopefully will be able to bounce back from its extreme shipping heat shock.

Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This discount in no way affects my opinions and I openly state both the positives as well as all negative points as I see them (as you can clearly see above).

UPDATE: The plant didn't make it; quickly turning totally brown within a week. I contacted the seller, Marimo Pet Company, and they quickly arranged for an exchange. The second plant is doing fantastic. I've added a star for a great plant AND great customer service!

Looks great!,1
My cats (have 4) are VERY picky when it comes to cat treats.  I buy these on amazon by the case and they love them.  Save so much $$$ over buying them at the local shops. You get 10 mega sized pouches! My cats line up everyday in anticipation of getting these treats.,1

"The best flea and tick medicine that also repels other insects like flies and mosquitos. We live on a dairy farm near the woods so this is very important. Most do not cover anything other than flea and tick. Also the amount of liquid is truly minimal in comparison to comparable less expensive brands.

Added bonus is that Amazon has this product substantially cheaper than any of the local stores.",1

"I have 2 dogs and it is a pain packing their bowls, food, etc.  This makes it simple!",1
"My vet has my dog on a very limited source of low fat treats due to her impaired fat metabolism.  She suggested chicken jerky, but specifically said to avoid those made in China due to all the contimination problems they've had.

I searched here on Amazon for ""chicken jerky"" and one of the suggested searches that popped up was ""chicken jerky dog treats made in usa."" Great! I used that search and this was listed at #8 on the list. Nowhere in the product description did it say it wasn't made here.  I ordered it and was unpleasantly surprised to find ""made in China"" on the label, when it arrived.

The FDA has several warnings out on dog chicken jerky treats made in China.  The latest ones were Nov. and Dec., so it's an ongoing  problem.  I never even opened the jar, as I didn't want to harm my dog.

Had the country of origen been in the product description, I never would have ordered these.",0
Perfect! Just as described.,1
"Snails Came perfectly packed and healthy. Ordered from Aquatic Arts direct, not amazon.

Only complaint, and it is incredibly minor: I wasn't aware there was much color variation, I was hoping for all black snails but their color ranged from light brown to very black.",1
"I bought this mat so I could get more coverage on my couch. I have another brand that I love. I have bought 2 of this brand and the device stops working quickly. I've only had this one for a few weeks. I've tried 3 brand new batteries. It only worked for about a week, then it died.
The device is brand new. I have another brand I use that works excellent. I will be returning this item and have to give it 1 star because it doesn't last long",0
This collar is great for walking your dog at night! We also love to put it on our dog while camping. Great buy!!!,1
Our dogs refuse to eat this version.,0
My dogs love these.  They come running when I get the bag out.,1
She is a small Yorki mix - 5 pounds and she walks right out ot them (((.  They are too low on her butt to get a hold.,0
Works very well. I also have a tri-tronic g3 which has more range but I like the petrainer better for my needs.,1
It works very well and permits my 100 lbs. wife and daughter to control our impulsive 80 lbs. dog/puppy. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that the plastic clip broke on first use. Amazon replaced the product quickly and the replacement has worked great. -- Tip: Follow the instuctions and don't make it too tight or you will leave an imprint on the fur of your dog's muzzel. The control is gentle.,1
"I read the reviews about the reflective stitching and how it is only on one side. However that's OK for me. I have two of these(one 1"" and one 3/4""), and they are our everyday leashes for my 30 lbs and 65 lbs dogs. They are well constructed and have held up well over the last several months. I expect to keep them around for a long time.",1
"Arrived as promised.  It is made in China, so instructions were suggestions at best (i.e. no mention of when or where to use provided hardware or tools).  Using a little imagination, trial and error, and common sense, I was able to completely assemble from box to car in under two hours.  Quality is what I expected at this price.  I realize this isn't a variocage, and wasn't expecting that level.  But it will work for what I need: a way to safely contain two of my three agility dogs in the cargo area.  I love that it locks so I can crate out of my car.  Its bars are aluminum but the walls, floor and ceiling are pressboard.  My dogs won't try to get out, they are regularly crated in mesh crates at trials.  I will need to add some sort of non-slip bedding to each area, as is: the floor would cause the dogs to slip and slide all over.

I will also mention that I have a 2013 GMC Terrain, I measured many times before purchase and it is a very (very) tight fit.  At least I know it won't slide around in the back of my car :)",1
Work Great,1
Worked to decrease ear inflammation in our golden retrievers' ears.,1
Does not work at all. Put it on the cats and it doesnt do anything. The fleas keep coming.,0
"This is not the item in the picture... instead of a paint brush like applicator, I got a finger toothbrush. The shipping for the product costs about the same for the product itself so I decided not to return cause I would be out more money then I would have liked.",0
Is super great,1
Works and price was good. One of the safer products out there.,1
"This item was shipped with out part D-- the right side wall of the crate.  Lacking this part, it is not much of an enclosure.  Locking would also be a slight issue. Currently processing a return with the supplying company.
It appeared to be a nice enough enclosure.  The pre-drilled holes for the ""L-Brackets"" were just marks made by nails.  A drill would be required to assemble it, that is, if you had all the walls.",0
Perfect harness for long drives. Kept pup safe and able to enjoy the long drive.,1
"We were looking for a relatively inexpensive heated bed for our outdoor barn cats.  We live in a cold winter climate, but our unheated, insulated pole barn stays about 20 degrees.  We purchased one bed, and I introduced it to the cats by putting it in a favorite spot, and giving them lots of attention while they curled up in it.

The bed is big enough for our 20-lb long-haired cat, who seems to like it the best.  Two smaller cats would be able to share the bed, but not our fat cats!  The bottom of the bed is warm to the touch, but not hot enough to pose a fire hazard.  The top of the bed is cool to the touch; you only feel the heating pad once you push your hand down on the cushion for awhile.  The cushion is held to the bottom of the bed with two velcro pieces.  The cord is heavy duty and adequate in length.  The zip off cover is a nice feature, too.

For the price, this bed is great.  We are buying another so each cat has their own!",1
Great Product!,1
Our three Bengals LOVE this food!  It is almost impossible to get it out of the can and onto a plate while fighting them off.,1
Fitwarm is probably my favorite their material and quality is top of the line.....their craftmanship of their dresses are grade A...I've ordered from many places and I'm never disappointed in Fitwarm products. They have an exact sizing chart that is very accurate. Love them If Icould I'd rate them 10 stars,1
"Well, part golden, part lab, part husky - the husky part is coming out!  Kind of fun to do.",1
These thing may as well be made of paper. They practically fall off the dogs.,0
"I was very excited to have a new treat toy for my dog, who is a one year old Beagle. I don't like the way it needs to tip and my dog gets impatient. He'd rather chew on the mushroom part, which in less than 30 minutes, that's what he did. His teeth marks are on the mushroom and he doesn't care about trying to get the treats out. He'll eventually break it, which is why after 30 minutes I took it away from him. He loves it as a chew toy, but it's not a good treat toy for my dog. Wasted my money and will probably get rid of it.",0
Okay. So I spend days and days installing this EXACTLY like it said to do in the instruction manual. I was careful when burying the line and when I had to splice and extend the line I was even more careful. Let me tell you how frustrating it was to get it completed and plug it up to find that it didn't work because there was trouble in the line somewhere?!!! Remember national lampoons Christmas vacation where he goes to turn on the lights for like the third time and it doesnt work and he loses his mind and he kicks the Santa??!! It was like that for me on a smaller scale. I spoke to my contractor friend about it the next day and he said that in his experience he would always suggest a larger wire. This one is just too thin so all it would have to take is a tiny bug or animal to chew it while in the ground and thats it. Hes had neighbors/friends buy and install this type of product and its the same story. Next thing you know you have to dig it all up and test sections and what a pain in the you know what. Never ever again! Sell a better wire and have a rep come out and replace this dinky wire and get it working and Ill change my rating and re-review your product with the highest regard. Too late to return too since its all buried! Thumbs down!!,0
"It works at locating our cat, but it blows through batteries. We mad a conscious effort regarding turning it off and on and the batteries are dead every time we go to use.",0
"alpha dogs might really benefit. My little one did...less barking and more calm. I suggest subscribing for a great deal. My dogs also crave the treat, so it must be good for just a snack",1
I have done training with shock collars before. I decided to get one so cheap because my dog only needed this for long distance training. This collar can go up to 100. I had it at 1 and the shock level cause burn marks on my dogs neck! I held it in my hand at the same level and I could not believe how bad it hurt. The vibration mode was like a cell phone vibrating and it wasn't doing much. Very disappointed with this product. Will be returning.,0
These bowls leak,0
"Absolutely love this i bought it for my chihuahua and it looks adorable on her.
I received it prior to the date i was told so that was a plus, i also like how it's stuffed so it doesn't fall flat.
Great product, I'm really happy i bought it.",1
Too perfume-y smelling. Smell stays on cats' paws... Not good.,0
Wonderful lubricant.,1
My dog loves it. The tabs w/ velcro are a little long and I had to cut them. Fits a bit loose so if he goes out running through bushes in my yard he loses it but he loves wearing it in the house and taking naps.,1
"Caveat: my pup is an amazing traveler in the car. That being said, I love this thing for keeping her secure and safe in the case of an accident, and yet it's so comfortable on her. It's very durable and the metal fittings give me as much confidence as possible in the thing. Lastly, it looks really good with the red striping and mesh. I wish it came in different colors, but it looks good. Highly recommended!",1
"I suppose they are great for some dogs, but my dog only occasionally liked them. I rated this product based on my dog's opinion, not mine. As far as I'm concerned they seem pretty good, but they do peel off little bits and that is something I didn't like. He's a big 105 lb dog and chews hard.",0
"I normally would not mark a product down for not carefully reading the description but I have to in this case.  It says in the description of this product has no stuffing. What does this mean? It means the toy is flat! You can't add catnip to this toy. My cats had no interest in it. I can't find it now to measure it, but despite the fact it says the toy is 12"" it does not look like much. Because it has no stuff and looks deflated it is much smaller than I imagined it would be. This would be a good toy if there was some way to fill it with catnip.",0
So cute! Perfect for a small to medium sized cat.,1
This food was recommended for my dog with dandruff.  She loves the food and her coat is shiny any nice after a couple of bags.,1
My dog loves these!!  She takes the little bone and runs away to eat it in peace.  We were giving her another type and had to force her to take it.,1
"I bought the Tuff Mutt Dog Treat Pouch for Training to use in the puppy class we are taking our puppy to. It is great!  It holds a full bag of treats plus a spot for poop bags. It is easy to access,  comfortable to wear and very well constructed.  I am very happy with the purchase.",1
No problems.,1
"It took my dog less than 15 minutes to chew the stuffing out of this toy.  I assumed that it would last a few months, if not longer.  Not so.  I would not spend my money on a Tuffy's toy again!",0
"I had been feeding my puppy this food with no problems but a month ago I bought a bag and I'm convinced it what made him extremely sick.

After the previous bag was gone I gave him a bowl of food from the new bag and he scarfed it up. That day, while I was at work, he vomited it back up in his kennel and when it came time for dinner he wouldn't touch the food. I figured this was because he didn't feel great from some random thing he ate in the back yard. The next morning he again wouldn't touch the food and the same thing happened that night. In the midst of all of this non eating and vomiting he also had terrible diarrhea. That's when we decided to give him a chicken, rice, and egg dish my wife made and take him to the vet. The vet gave us some medicine for his stomach and the homemade food seemed to help.

I won't ever feed him Taste of the Wild again but with all of this being said, I complained to TOTW and within 10 days they sent me a check for the cost of the bag of food. I have to give them props for being quick to respond to an issue that they seemed to be very concerned with.",0
Puppy is not having a good time with it much.,0
"BUYER BEWARE!!!!  My vet recommended this product for my 7 year old kitty who was pooping outside of her box.  AFTER THREE DAYS, THE DEFECTIVE DIFFUSER HAD EMPTIED HALFWAY AND MY KITTY WOULDN'T EAT OR MOVE.  Clearly she was overdose - her lethargy prompted me to look at the diffuser and i was shocked to see that it was half empty as they are supposed to last one full month.  I know many people love these things, but it is very important to check and be sure the proper amount of liquid is being diffused.  I will be contacting the MFR and praying my kitty makes a full recovery - windows have been open now for a few days and she seems to be coming back to herself - slowly.",0
"My finickiest boy loves this! Normally he turns up his nose at ANY pate style food, but not this one....he will fight off the other cats to finish their portions too. Amazing!",1
I LOVE IT! I HAVE A TOY POODLE WHO IS MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT HIS 9POUNDS CLOSE TO 10 POUNDS AND IT FITS HIM PERFECT VERY COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO PUT ON.,1
stopped working after a few weeks.,0
"I saw these and thought they were a good idea, so I went to the local hardware store, found two damaged granite tiles which the hardware store cut in half for me and marked down because they were damaged.  I ended up with four chin chillers for less than $2.",0
Don't expect to use this hanging outside the tank.  It will leak.  Design is pretty poor.  I am using it in a sump so even if it leaks no big deal.  But beware.  Water leaks around,0
"I felt as if it was too tight and cutting off his breathing....and when it was that tight, ONLY, did he calm down.  The my pup just lay down and wouldnt move.  I was not sure this was safe for him.",0
"I was a little nervous when I opened up the Amazon box and found that the package looked like it had been balled up. I opened the package and they seemed fine however reading the ingredients I found out that the packaging was misleading. My mistake- I should have read the ingredients but when your product is marketed as a peanut when it's really chicken and a few other things.. You kind of lose some points.

Anyways- the dogs liked them however their tummies maybe not so much. Lots of stinky gas from my crew this evening. Probably wouldn't buy it again.",0
"I do love it, because our little (well not so little Boston Terrier) looks so darn cute in it.  I first purchased the medium I felt it was too big and bulky plus it covered way over his little private part and the under neck fold/piece just looked uncomfortable and big.  The small fit good, I felt he moved well.  Under belly has two very strong good size/coverage velcro straps and on top of those an adjustable clip strap .  The back velcro strap fit perfect the one around his chest touched only about 1/2 an inch which was fine because of the clip strap and that fit fine and held it together -really no big deal for me that they did not velcro.  However I really wonder if this would keep them from going under, HE LOVES the water but swims with his girlfriends a lab and golden retriever they are big and swim super far and he really can not keep up.  He does follow them way out there and it seems just his little head stays up so I'm not sure if it really keeps him afloat -it does give me a tiny bit peace of mind but I do still wonder.  He is 28lbs good size Boston Terrier but I felt the medium was just too big but maybe it would keep him better afloat but he would not be able to play around so well with all that bulk.  If you are not sure I would just get 2 sizes and send one back- I really should have just done that an been done.  I did read one review about the stitching and yes it was a poor job, some areas I may need to go over I will see how it holds up, but over all the stitching was closed but not the best job and crooked in places.",1
"This works exactly as it should. My cat loves it, too. This brush makes it so easy to clean off the hair. No more picking at the brush or using a comb to clean out the hair. After brushing her for a while I release the button and the bristles go back inside leaving just the hair. I have already passed the information about this brush on to a friend with a cat.",1
"My picky eating dog would gobble up her meds using the pill pocket. It's much better than stashing the pill in a small piece of bread smeared in peanut butter, which of course ends up on your finger tips. Super easy and worth the money.",1
"Thanks to the furminator, it reduced the shedding in the house significantly. a very good buy and was worth every penny.",1
"I am very disappointed in the fabric on these beds....I wasted $50 on 2 of these beds.  You cannot hose them clean like you can a Coolaroo.  There is a backing on the material, therefore, when you try to hose off bed, dog hair does not come off.  With my Coolaroos I can blast hair/dirt through the fabric...not so with Amazons beds.  Also the fabric ripped very easily.  Don't waste your money....buy Coolaroo.",0
"My koi fish pond (12,000 gal. est) was infested with fish lice. One jar did not get rid of the pests, but they were diminished in number. I purchased a second jar, which got rid of them. The fish were not harmed.",1
...Is what my cat would say if she could talk.,1
"Great item.  My cats love the circulating water, and it is much easier to keep clean than the bubbling dispenser I had.  I love the stainless steel.  Shipping was extremely fast....can't go wrong here!",1
my little daschund love these treats and will not eat anything else.,1
He looks like a little loan officer. He doesn't trip over it and doesn't seem to mind it either.,1
Thing is dead just under a month!!! Don't waste your money on this cheap china junk! Look elsewhere to buy.,0
I installed the bulb upon arrival and it did not turn on.,0
"destroyed by our dog in 5 minutes, not very durable",0
this works very well and is sturdy.  my cats enjoys it daily and it is easy to clean.  buy it !!!!!,1
My dog loves this pool!  He's a German Shephard and he fits in it.,1
"This thing has zero effect on my dogs. Notice I said dogs plural form, neither one of my dogs had any effect from this.",0
"This is just a squared up container.  It has no support at all and the dogs were all over it. it does not hold up as the picture shows. My Pugs were distressed with it and I had to sit in the back seat with them to try and keep them inside. I had to put a towel inside it and a pillow underneath it, or else its just an expensive bag",0
"Bought thie item, but they only lasted eight months total on one dog....meaning alternating the collar each one only lasted four months. It worked great while it lasted, but I expected more life than what I received.",0
"Cute , but should possibly be promoted for large dogs. My 16 ponders have trouble carrying.  Tore the cute little feet off in the first hous but remnants of the main body still exist enough to be tossed",0
great,1
I really liked the waterer. I didn't have to constantly refill a disc. But within 4 months time it developed a crack and started leaking water all over the floor. Cant find a replacement bottle.,0
Cats love it.,1
Im not sure if its the same strength.  the product took 2 WEEKS TO GET TO ME. I will not order again.,0
Will buy again.....,1
Didn't meet my expectations . Cost me a whole lot more then just going to the pet store and save me twenty two dollars.,0
I have a Chihuahua and got a medium. She looked very uncomfortable and it was straining on her neck. I think this is a better fit for heavier small dogs.,0
8 out of 11 cats love it.,1
"Fits into any decor.  This is my second one, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hates the look of the typical cat litter box.",1
This is a terrific Bowl. My dog loves it and I love it's no spill feature.,1
This brush did not work for our cats or our dog. It just didn't grata their fur very well.,0
My cat lives this food!,1
"the collar is not long enough to use the last 2 holes because the end will not tuck in,2 more inches and it would be a good collar.i got no response from the dealer or manufacturer,bob",0
Cat loves it.  Arrived in good time.,1
As advertised. Quickly shipped. Thank you,1
Works for outdoor cat who has many adventures!,1
Be very careful with the dosage. The instructions are confusing. I gave one tablet to my 40 pound dog. They said on the label one chewable tablet for every 30-40 pounds. She vomited in the night and non stop by the morning. She was vomiting blood. I had to take her to the vet. The vet said the dosage was too high on the label.,0
I very attractive ornament for a smaller tank. Very colorful.,1
leaked,0
"Our dog could not eat the original Greenies because he was extremely allergic to them.  Saw these ""Grain Free"" and got excited!  He loves them!  He's not allergic to them!  No more doggie breath!  We are all happy.",1
Seems to be working,1
did not work for my turtles,0
Tape does not retract.,0
"My dogs (40-55 lb.) love these.  They chew for about four minutes; it's not a gone-instantly treat.  These dental snacks are great-smelling and don't cause any digestive problems.  On the other hand, they are much too expensive for my budget.",1
"These work great, I give my large lab 1 a day and that seems to do the trick. I haven't ever given her all 4 that they suggest and have still found that it works with less. Have recommended it to anyone I know who has anal gland issues with their dog.",1
Amazing cat food!,1
Not sure why this cage would get a bad review but this cage is perfect for what i needed. I wanted a extra large cage so my dog had room to stretch while I'm at work. I have a shiba inu and i can fit his bed bowl and toys in the cage which is big enough for a German Shepard. Unless you have pitbull that loves chewing on metal you will love this cage!,1
"After a recent car crash I have become more concerned about the safety of my young dog on frequent car trips (vet, training, doggie park, etc), so I decide to buy this product. My dog does not mind wearing it, and it brings me peace of mind.
Pros:
- Comfortable for my dog (she even seems more relaxed!)
- Easily adjustable as she grows
- Simple to attach/unattach from the seat belt with a carabiner
- Dog feels snug in the harness
Cons:
- Somewhat restricts dogs movement (can still sit/lie down however)
- Gets in the way of collar/leash at times",1
Redesigned leash is now stronger with an improved metal latch. Ideal for large strong dogs.,1
The coat is NOT waterproof.,0
"We got this for our angora bunny, and it's really not the best brush for her fur. The little nubs at the end of the brush are helpful for protecting her skin but the quality of the tines is poor and rather than helping to groom the hair they just get stuck and pull. Would be better for a short haired critter.",0
"What is better then one crinkle ball?  A whole bag of crinkle balls!  My 5 cats love these things.  They play with these everyday.  When I received the package, I opened it up and poured it out and the next thing I knew there were crinkle balls flying everywhere.  The cats were having so much fun.  I was retrieving them from under the furniture as cats raced around the house attacking and chasing them.  All they have to hear is me picking one up and they are ready to chase them around the house.  I have rolled over on them in bed, stepped on them putting my shoes on, I have found them in the couch, it is amazing where you can find these balls when a cat plays with them.  All in all the cats give them 5 stars.",1
Came on time.& The dogs love it!! Fresh food!!,1
I have always bought this type of bag for cleaning up after my dog.  The cost for the 35 rolls was just a little bit more then what I normally pay for 8 bags.  Great deal.  Fast shipping.,1
Good stuff! Just what the little fry needed....,1
"I have dogs but they love the veggie treats just as much as the chicken or beef.  They don't care as long as they are Ruby's Naturals!!!!
All natural treats are the only way to go.",1
"I had my doubts about dog diapers but took a chance on these because there were so many great reviews. I have a very old dog that has bladder issues and relieves himself whenever, wherever. Suffice to say when I found these I thought my prayers had been answered and I would no longer be chasing him around the house cleaning up dog pee! I started using these and he didn't mind, didn't seem to be in any discomfort or anything. I changed them frequently and washed them in the washing machine by themselves. The quality of these diapers is not great, after 1 wash they looked tattered and old and they only continued to look worse the more I washed them. They also take FOREVER to dry! Even using the dryer it would take 2 hours to dry! I did notice that these shifted around on his little belly quite a lot which meant that the pee part of the diaper was getting all over him. This caused the need for frequent bathing, which is not good for dogs! After using these for about 3 weeks and taking care to change them and bath him frequently, his nether region turned BLACK! I discontinued use immediately, gave him a bath and after 2 weeks, he has started to look normal again. I will not be using these going forward. I find it strange that no one else had a similar experience, surely my dog is not the only one that experienced this.",0
"The bed is nice, but the zipper came off the bed cover the first time I tried to wash it.",0
"I really wanted to love this. If she digs out the chickies, this is great for our 8-month old Maltipoo. However, as she pulled and scratched at the henhouse, the red fuzz pilled, and she started pulling that off and eating it, unbeknownst to us until she threw up a bunch of red fuzz. So, we've put the house away and use the chicks as indoor throw toys.",0
"This bed is well made,very sturdy and washable. My Pomeranian loves it and it withstands the two larger dogs trying to get in it.",1
"Ordered this thinking I was ordering a 2 pack. But, I only received one. Chatted with customer service and she tried to convince me that this 2 pack meant only 1 refill. Huh?
So, seeing as I could not convince her that I was right and that 2 means two I am sending it back. I can go to the pet store and get one for $5.00  Since when does a 2 pack mean one? Someone here is living in another dimension.",0

"Birds pick out and drop on the ground the milo, which is the primary ingredient; they mostly only like the sunflower seeds, which are few and far between.

"I want to tell you a story. I woke up at 3am one morning unable to open my left eye because one of my dog's short stiff white hairs got stuck in my eye while I was sleeping. She's my baby but she sheds constantly like I don't even know how she still has fur.
After this incident I proceeded to buy 80 dollars worth of anti shedding tools, sticky rollers, and this...the ChomChom Roller. I got it today and was so excited to use it...I'm desperate here guys. First thing I tried it on was my bed sheet. And let me tell you her fur has some magical powers to where I can't wash it out, can't vacuum it off. Nothing NOTHING has ever worked. But this. This tool has been the ONLY thing in the world to ever conquer the magical pain in the butt that is my dog's fur. This is going to change my life. Let the pictures speak for themselves.",1
Horrible! My boxer was pulling on it and it broke within the first hour!,0
Love this dog treat!  My dog loves it & I like it because it's clean & easy to break into small bites for rewards.,1
The whistle broke 3 months later.,0
Hyper chew toy not worth the money. It was destroyed in 3 minutes and the nyla bone caused him bleeding. The kong toys are great!,0
"Advertised as a set of 4 assorted toys, except I was only sent one. I would never have made this purchase knowing that, and since it was delivered elsewhere as a gift cannot return it for the misleading piece of garbage it is. Very disappointed! Don't waste your time with this, there is no excuse for tricking people into buying an assortment of one :(",0
"I have two cats, one larger than the other. These work fine on the larger cat. But these clippers are way too big for my smaller cat. The ends of the blades extend out past the area that actually cuts the nail, and those long ends do not fit between her nail and her paw pad. She was uncomfortable with me trying to push her pads down so far to get these clippers in there. These would work great for large cats and for dogs. I noted that a lot of the positive reviews are from dog owners. I am returning these and will buy the more standard ones for cats.",0
"Great product,  Thank you!",1
Zero effect.,0
Not quite big enough for my cats but they seem to love it anyway So I guess I will keep it but Im going to have to buy something bigger for the colder weather. Nice sturdy Design for the house.,1
Perfect size for my chiweenie and japanese chin. Large squeaker inside each toy so its easily squeeked even when they are just holding them which gets them more excited. Happy customer.,1
"Like many other reviewers, we have purchased multiple littermaids in our cat's lifetime.  We bought this one to replace our 3 year old littermaid who's motor eventually died after regular use by one cat.  I was excited to get a new shiny ""elite"" littermaid, but was sadly disappointed when we found that they changed how the littermaid functioned.  It no longer lifts the waste up and in to the recepticle - it now just slides everything in, which includes more clean litter than it does waste.  It also isn't strong enough to scoop the ""pee spots"" which just get stuck in the corners of the box and forces you to have to scoop the box on a regular basis.
So you throw out clean litter, and have to scoop the waste.  At this point we will have to go back to a regular box, it is less work than this ""elite"" littermaid.",0
"Product arrived rotten.  Yes, I've purchased bully sticks before and I know they have an odor.",0
I feed this exclusively to my 5 y/o domestic longhair. A little goes a omg way since its packed with nutrients. It has a tasty fishy smell but doesnt make her breath stink. No more fur balls either.,1
Great dog shampoo at a reasonable price.,1
"I absolutely HIGHLY recommend this food for any dog and esp for small dogs. The bites are a nice small size, the ingredients are EXCELLENT. I have yorkies and they love it and do well on it.",1
We have been trying to contact customer service because we are having an issue with the static connecting with the dog and there is no one ....  I have been trying for hours ....,0
"My dogs like nylabones, but this one is their favorite shape as its easier for them to hold on to than the straight ones I think.",1
I heater quite after 1 month the other lasted 2 weeks longer,0
inexpensive and looks nice. cats liked to play in it. only down side is they destroyed the ball toy pretty quickly.,1
"While this product is what i expected, the description of the package size is misleading. It said it was 14 Liter, but what it really is - is 6 L and expands to 14. So, based on that, the cost of this product is far more expensive than what I can get in my local pet store. Definitely will not buy this from Amazon again.",0
Literally lasted 1 day... nothing like the picture...should have listened to the reviews...,0
This is nice.  Size is big but that good put it under a cat box and it has elimated the cats from tracking litter every where.  Am planning on ordering another on for my basement cat boxs,1
"I ordered the java fern and the mini moss together and they both arrived in an unacceptable condition. The fern had multiple leaves that were solid brown and shriveled up, the 4-5 ""green"" leaves had brown spots all over.",0
Cleans the dogs well and smells nice.  Nice creamy rich lather.,1
"It always falls and when it moves, hard to see numbers on the other side. I wish it had numbers on both sides.",0
Top falls right off. No clips to hold it in place,0
Didn't work for our dogs at all. Would not buy,0
Great cage for the price,1
Worked ok for the first few months but once the remote battery died I found it was not able to charge properly (dies as soon as it was unplugged) so I guess I will be throwing it all away.,0
Excellent quality! The petals Looked so real... I am very pleased with this product! Very pleased!!! Would definitely order again,1
doesn't work very well don't waste your money on this item,0
This brush does wonders for my Golden Retriever.  Her coat hasn't looked this good in years.,1
"Looks nicer on the picture.
This is to big for my average size German Sheperd. It is not adjastble.",1
this bag was blown when I got it so the contents were all over the box,0
"This ball is perfect for when my service dog thinks it's play time, which is usually right before going to bed for the evening. I will be re-ordering this item in the larger size, since she has grown so much.",1
We have 3 kinda fussy Siamese cats who actually like this food.  They all seem to prefer Science Diet flavors so we were surprised when they ate this so willingly.  Worth the money for sure for our girls!,1
"Saw no difference in any of three cats' behavior, so does that mean all three are among the five out of 100 who don't benefit? What are the odds?",0
Makes a full gallon - and smells pretty decent!,1
junk doesn't work,0
"Amazing company and Amazing owners, I highly recommend this dog food as my pack loves it. I have 6 dogs all 50+ Lbs and they love this, I highly recommend this dog food and I highly recommend you give it a chance, I really don't understand the negative reviews but I ensure you this will be a great purchase.",1
"Something in these made my dog horribly sick. I was up all night with her while she vomited & had diarrhea. Had to take her to the vet, where she was given a shot & a week of medicine to take home. We offered them to our neighbor who said his dogs couldn't have them either. Waste of money.",0
The handle was broken on delivery with no damage to the box that could be seen. Other than the broken handle the item was functional.,0
"Fast delivery, Appropriate size, easily visible.",1
"I had bought these to replace the pair of Doggles I lost on a walk for a dog whose eyes need to be shielded from UV. The product was exactly as advertised, cost less than the first pair I bought, and came within days.  The only thing I wish I had known was that these, which fit the dog's eyes well, offer her less peripheral vision than the previous pair, which were a large. These were a medium.",1
Love it! Works great at night,1
This is a great brush.  It does a good job on my Bichon's and the ease with which I can remove the hair makes it a real plus,1
I have two min pins that like to chew.  These unravel pretty quick and all the stuff falls out leaving a curled up piece of rawhide that one of my dogs will chew (because he will chew anything) but the other one won't touch it.,0
Bought this for our little fur baby and it was awesome. The material is a bit on the cheap side but held up my little puppy that was running around.,1
"I bought these for my dogs and they both got very sick!

They kept vomiting green chunks and when they would poop it was bloody and had chunks of the greenies treat in it that they just couldn't digest. I stopped feeding them to my dogs and after a few days the vomiting and bloody/hard stools stopped.

I will NEVER give my dogs this stuff ever again, I am not the only person who has had this problem. Please go read up on how some peoples dogs have died because of this!",0
It looks great. It is extremely strong. It is very handy. It will pinch the ..... out of your fingers/hand when you put it on your dog. The main latch is a meat eater.,1
"I was tired of other brands dripping. This one works perfectly, and quick and easy to refill. I just wish it came in a larger size.",1
"Great deal, great for environment",1
hard to use..very uncomfortable for the dog....,0
My cat LOVES this! It is the best 100 bucks I've ever spent? Just knowing that he gets the amount of pleasure he does from it makes me so happy. Not only does he love it and use it daily but it looks GREAT. By far the most attractive cat tree I've ever seen. Comparably attractive cat furniture sell for obscene prices. This is a great deal. You won't regret it and your cat will love you for it!,1
"Fits my 10lb yorkie without any issues! This bag is durable, well made, and I love the expandable area. It gives my dog a little extra space while we are waiting at the gate. Fits perfectly underneath AA economy, economy plus, and business seats. I'm even able to leave the expandable area open while in flight so that he's not all bunched up.

Also has a little strap on the back side that you can slide over your rolling carry-on luggage (or any luggage handle) so you're not carrying it around yourself. Also folds down pretty flat making storage easy.",1
This was just like jewelry on my shih tzu. Didn't notice a difference in  his behavior unfortunately.,0
"Sugar Bear enjoys her new harness, which allows her a lot of mobility with safety.  The color choices are also nice, especially for multiple dog homes.  I highly recommend this harness!",1
My Two Cats love these toys. They were exactly as described. I ordered two and received the Purple Panda looking one and the Brown Bear. They are soft and they have a crinkle sound when you squeeze them which my male cat loves!!! I will definitely buy these again for my kitties.,1
"Attractive.  Like that there is a notch for the underside of the neck so it doesn't choke our beardie.  The flocking on the side does stick to her spikes, so 4 out of 5 stars.",1
"I purchased this product on May 9 and it was delivered around May 11, 2013.  As of yesterday, July 3, 2013, both zippers had broken (the zips still work but the piece that one pulls on is broken off).  The bag is very small but it also didn't hold up well.
I won't order this again.",0
The costume is super cute but the wrong size and I cant return it without paying for shipping which is 6.99 and the costume was only 11.00. Theres no point so Im stuck with a costume that doesnt fit Im super bummed bc its so cute.,0
"Appears to be moldy, like the wood wasn't treated correctly. I took it out of the package, and immediately put it back in. Not ideal.",0
"This is so cute, perfect for what I wanted it for.  Very well made.",1
"Stays on the cage really well, no worry of it falling off. Only thing was the pictured bath is blue and the product is yellow.",1
"I bought this for my 6 month old German Shepherd. She loved the toy and she spent ALL day chewing on it, which is why I bought it so she wouldnt chew other things. The same day it was delievered the  loops of the pretzel got stuck between her bottom jaw and her canine teeth. My puppy cried and cried and it took my family an hour to get it out.",0
"i have used both litter pearls and crystal litter, this is the crystal. the litter is pretty good but it isn't what it is advertised to be. very dusty",0
My cats love this stuff.,1
It's easy to use and my dogs like it. I cant really speak for how much it works since my dogs are still on pain meds.,1
"Without question one of the absolute worst dog toys we've seen. To say that this line of Nerf toys is unacceptable is an understatement - the poor build quality along with sub-standard materials pose significant chocking hazards and worse, to your best friend.

I added this particular toy on a lark, to my usual collection of Nylabone, Booda and Kong toys for our Old English Bulldogs. I had recalled the Nerf name from decades ago and decided to give this a shot. Needless to say it's boxed up and ready for a return to Amazon.

From a conceptual design it's easy to see how the toy may be fun for your pooch - however it ends there as the manufacturing leaves much to be desired.

* Flimsy paper thin rubber can easily be torn by human fingers and would in no way hold up to average chewing let alone the determined chomp of aggressive chewers.

* Unlike most rope toys this rope appears to be woven with a great deal of Nylon threads. Nylon and poly fibers can bunch up in your dogs digestive tract causing blockage and in a worse case scenario the dreaded Bloat  - which is most always fatal.

* The openings in the football would be easy for most any dog, large or small to pry and stretch wide open with little effort. For some unknown reason Nerf felt the need to wrap the center pieces of rope with what appears to be electrical tape.

* What you can't see in the photograph is how pronounced the seam all around the football. There's plenty of it too and enough for your dog to use his or her front teeth to chew off small pieces and swallow them and or begin a sizable tear.

Pieces of rubber can cause choking and intestinal blockage which again most always results in emergency surgery and has great potential of lethal consequences.

The one positive review of this toy has been left by someone who has only reviewed other Nerf dog toys from the same seller - none of which are marked as a verified purchase. Having written more than 600 reviews on Amazon - with the majority dedicated to pet products, I consider these reviews bogus and false. Planted reviews compromise the integrity of Amazons consumer review system. What is more, they're placed by the sellers themselves with the sole purpose of selling product - period.

The Nerf line is also manufactured in China where quality control protocols are none existent as are child labor laws. Hence the declaration by the FDA to avoid all pet foods, care and toys manufactured in China. Nearly every single major recall over the past decade of the aforementioned products have been linked to products imported from China.

Based on the above, my recommendation is to avoid these toys at all costs. There are plenty of quality dog toys by companies like Kong, Orbee, Nylabone and others made with the safety of your dog in mind and made in the USA.",0
"I was really excited about this toy for my 30lb mini golden doodle who is 1 year old  however..
For the first 20 minutes I was hopeful. It did not seem like he was going to be able to destroy it, but a few minutes later he had pierced through it with his canine tooth and began ripping it to shreds.  I am having the worst time finding toys for him because of the specific way he chews.  He will use his canine teeth to sit and chew very specifically with the side of his mouth until he pierces through whatever he is working on.  Maybe if your dog doesn't chew this way, the toy would survive.",0
The only thing I took 1 star is NOT from the provider but the product; the clip-on is a bit too hard.,1
"On the inside, underside of the skull, there are spikes.  No joke.  I laughed.  I'd be surprised if Exo Terra hasn't had small claims court lawsuits brought against them for injury to pets from this product!

This Exo Terra product should be recalled!

All Living Things makes great similar products, but that line of products is only offerred inside Petsmart stores.",0
My dog LOVES this!,1
I love the double-entry.  It makes it easier for our older dog to get in and out and it also helps with our extremely tall dog.  It's easily assembled and is very sturdy.,1
"I love it but my dog doesn't.  I have a lab who drinks very little and will go for days without water if I don't let her drink from the toilet. She also like to drink from the bathtub faucet. I thought this fountain would be great for her but she won't go near it.  The fountain works great! The motor is the most quiet fountain motor I've ever heard.  I am returning it, of course.",1
"Absolutely love the ease of grooming my longhair GSD with the Furminator with vacuum
  ]",1
"Day 1: Dogs gave me pity face and wondered what they did to deserve the torture. They didn't move. Realized they couldn't remove them and just gave me stank look. I felt bad but stayed committed

Day 2: They're over it. They learned to jump with them on and reach places, scratch around the diaper. One did go under the couch and wiggle until it slid and looked like he had on baggy pants. A few times of saying no and adjusting- they stopped. I rewarded them for staying still.

I will say that I am relieved that I do not have to ""wonder"" what they're doing in the other room or finding (or smelling) spots. I calculated on average that I spent more than 2 hours cleaning carpets and reprimanding the dogs per week plus spending countless $ on cleaners. If you are thinking of spending $20 on doggy diapers is too much... think of the time and the money you will save and the feeling of FREEDOM you will finally have.",1
"These mats are great! They catch most of the litter and I am able to dump it back in the box. I would definitely recommend! They are nice and large and keep the tracking to a minimum,",1
i rescued a toy poodle and she has no teeth.  i feed her canned foods because of the softness and was feeding her things like vienna sausages as a treat but i don't want all the sodium and crap in the canned meats to be a regular part of her diet so i looked on amazon for a healthy soft treat.  these may be healthy but they are not for a toothless toy dog at all.  she sniffed and wasn't even interested in the smell and it's not something you can just tear bits off of.  she's been given the pup-peroni cheese treats and she loves them but they are not really healthy.  any suggestions for my rescue would be welcomed.,0
Leash comes as described. Easy on and off. Bought the matching collar too. Would purchase again.,1
Disappointed. They are heavy and our 2 dogs didn't care for them. Too hard to get the treats out of them. Will clean up and donate to shelter after one use.,0
This cutter is way too big for a cat. Do not buy if you are planning on using on your cat. It looks like a good quality cutters for dogs.,0
"I have a cocker spaniel with calcified ear canals that constantly had ear infections.  Finally had ear ablation surgery on one of the ears (which changed his life and he's a much happier, energetic, healthier dog!) but hoping to keep from doing another surgery on the other one.  Was turned onto this stuff by a friend who has a cavalier king Charles and it's amazing.  It's not a cure all - if the dog has a proper ear infection you need to go to the vet.  But it's a great first step to prevent an ear infection in the first place.  My boyfriend is a pharmacist and looked at the ingredients and it's a standard anti-fungal, anit-yeast and anti-itch with the hydrocortisone.

It's really amazing.  My dog's ears have maintained infection free after using this.  If they start to look annoyed, a week's treatment with this per the instructions works great and clears up the problem.  Especially in the summer months when his ears will have more moisture and heat, breeding ground for infections, this really keeps them at bay!",1
My dog won't use it,0
cute,1
"The collar worked great at first and then after 2 1/2 months it stopped shocking. I've changed the batteries invade that was it but it's not. I can change it to every level and nothing, only beeps.",0
"Not really happy with these. Got hoping they would cover smell well since they have the carbon. Unfortunately the last pads we had that were similar size and material covered odors and absorbed MUCH more than these. They were unscented, similar size, and cheaper.",0
Way too thin. Don't buy,0
"My one year Tagg warranty expires tomorrow. The tracker unit has been replaced three times under warranty (and always with a refurbished unit, never a new one). The base unit has been replaced once under warranty. Four days before warranty expiration, the current tracker unit has failed. That says it all. Any product which needs four units to get through a one year warranty period isn't worth the purchase price. If the product consistently worked it would meet my expectations but it simply does not work.

Customer service is very strange. Telephone assistance has a written set of fixes to try to get things going again. I have had several people at this level of assistance who genuinely try to help. When those fixes fail (which they usually have) it takes a minimum of 48 hours to hear back from ""real"" tech support. Real tech support then takes another few days and attempts at trying to get the thing working only to eventually give up and send you another replacement--and charge you for the shipping (except the last time when I refused). The replacement process has taken anywhere from 7-10 days total time and many, many hours on the telephone.

Would I consider upgrading to their new version at the ""insider"" price? Not a chance.",0
too small,0
"I've had this for two years or so, and haven't yet chewed through it.",1
absolutely love it! I would totally buy again,1
"Cheaply made product.  Dinosaur doesnt move, air bubbles come from underneath the product.  Product doesnt stay at the bottom of fish tank either.  Packed full of rock and built them around the base and it still doesnt want to stay at the bottom.  Dont buy this product as its a waste of your money!",0
Small but cool  glad it was an add on,0
Was not happy with the birdcage sposed to be heavy duty I would hate to see their lightweight metal very flimsy metal very poor built for the price I paid on this cage I'm very disappointed. I wouldn't even give this one star but I had to to submit it,0
"our cat loves it, materials high quality and it is easy to build.",1
My dogs love them,1
"ORDERED 2 DIFF COLORS, PINK TO MATCH A COAT I BOUGHT FOR MY DOG AND A RED ONE TO MATCH HER RED XMAS HARNESS THAT I BOUGHT HER. VERY WELL MADE, GOOD QUALITY LEASH. VERY BRIGHT COLORS. DOG LIKES THEM AND SO DO I. GREAT PRICE ALSO. WOULD RECOMMEND.",1
The package arrived but the bottle had been opened and the seal had been broken.  I don't know if I can give this to my dog.,0
"While this cable does store nicely and doesn't get tangled with itself, I would not recommend it for a dog. The problem is that the coils are too tight.  This causes two problems.  First, whenever the dog starts to walk away from whatever point is attached, there is tension on their collar because the coils want to wrap back up.  Second, because the coils are so tight, they get wrapped around my dogs ankles. Every time I try to use this cable (3 times now),I have spent most of my time unwrapping her poor feet, which she can't do herself because the coils cinch down on her.  She flops onto her back to try and kick them off and only gets more tangled.  Instead, I've resorted to using a long leash at the end of the cable so that she's not as close to the coils til I could get online and just order a regular straight tie-out cable.",0
"Despite being named a ""Megalast"" toy it only lasted about 15 minutes. In their defence I have a hard time finding anything that lasts more than an hour or two.",0
"This tree has not got enough area for the cats to climb comfortably from one level to the next. The fleece material that the platforms are covered with is very cheesy.
 The price is a good bargain, but I would rather pay more and get a better quality product. It is also somewhat wobbly on it's base.

Not what I expected, so I am disappointed with the purchase.
We will beef it up and add features ourselves to make it more fun for our cat.",0
Not durable enough for our chewer. Had to trash it within a day.,0
"Great idea, but did not stay fastened to the seatbelt receiver.",0
"The best ever if you have finicky cats. Purchased this for use with 2 senior cats who did stinky poops and pee so much...many times they did not bother using the box but some random area nearby. I was amazed at the difference. Just buy it. Use less too but refill the box as needed. They use the box!!! It doesn't smell!!! They are changed behavior!!! No dust so healthier for them!!!
Amazon delivers. The bag is heavy perhaps you can find a container to put it into to pour from but I manage...",1
"dog still has horrible gut breath, after dental treatment. guess I was expecting more, as my friend who suggested this product loves it for his dogs. my case is probably an isolated case as I am sure this is a fine product::just not for my dog.",0
"I am not happy with this product. I bought this dog bowl because it said it doesn't skid. Well - it skids. The kitchen floor is tile and when my dog try's to eat, the bowl moves all over the place. I will more than likely be returning this.",0
"Works well, not perfect but well.",1
We got the product in the mail without problems and our dog loved chewing on the hoof we gave her. The problem was the next day she threw up multiple times and in her vomit were chunks of hoof that had not been digested. A little concerned that giving her more may cause the same issue. If this hadn't happened I'd think this was a great and affordable product for dogs who are aggressive chewers.,0
Great tags at an affordable cost! Quality work as well!,1
"I have never received the dog boots , so l don't know if they were good or bad.and the boots have been paid for so I am not happy with paying for something I never received",0
"The glove works fine to pull excess hair off my cat, but it was a nightmare to clean the glove.",0
Lulu looks pretty with it. Very good quality.,1
"This shampoo is unbelievable.  It was recommended to me by a holistic vet and I purchased it from Amazon even though I was doubtful that it would work.  I've lost count of all the shampoos that I've tried for our Miniature Schnauzer.  After bathing him with this, there wasn't the usual itching and scratching that we usually see after having him groomed or giving him a bath.  If your pet is having a problem with itching and scratching, I would recommend giving this a try.  I bought the smallest size to try but will be ordering a large size next time.  It's so nice to see him calm and relaxed after his bath.",1
"Dont buy these pads! Half of the pads are missing a quarter of the plastic side to hold the spill and I highly doubt there are 5 layers for absorbing pee. If it weren't for the fact that I need them now and no time to return for refund, I would definitely return them! Instead of using one or two pads to cover the bottom of a sick puppies cage, I have two use three or four. DO NOT BUY THESE PADS USE ANOTHER BRAND
Theres no gel or enough material layered to absorb. The edges you can easily peel apart and the urine or running poop ends up on the floor. I have never been so displeased with a purchase such as these. I may as well use them to wipe windows instead of completely taking a loss. Try Hertz. They have been the best, so far. Im not sure if you can see in the pictures, but clearly these weren't manufactured well. The only good thing I can notate is the the large size. Be ready to use newspaper to compensate for what this product is lacking! I don't even want to leave 1 Star, it deserves NO STAR.",0
"The leasb itself hurts hands, need to be carrful, but reflectivity good.",1
This is the real deal. Quality pad for my puppy's needs; and the box arrived on time. Great product,1
Great quality and fantastic service.,1
"With two tiny under 5lb puppies I was going through quite a few disposable wee pads a week and no matter how much I washed the ""grass"" mats held in the urine smell so I started to look for other options. I came acrosss these and figured, why not? I am so glad that I did! These work great and a bonus is, the puppies don't look at these like a play toy like they do with the disposable ones.

They seem to wick away the moisture and there is very little to no smell. They also wash up great and even after running through the dryer (on low) they lay flat afterwards.",1
Don't Buy!!  Poorly constructed.  My dog pulled once and the stitching started to fail.  One day and the tug was unusable!!,0
"This bowl was not 3 quart it was just a little over 2 quarts. I returned the bowl.
It seemed to be well made but we do rescue and needed the larger size bowl.",0
My dogs love the taste but a lot of the vitamins came broken in the bottle which I think is unsatisfactory.,0
I got these to help my cat with FLD after a bout with pancreatitis. She hates taking pills and even if got them in her I think it made her vomit. She would throw up 2 at a time sometimes. One would be a little squishy one would be nearly intact. For some reason she just wasn't digesting them. I switched over to Marin which is a capsule form. You break it and put it on wet food. In my cats case I had to mix it with wet food and water and syringe it down. It still doesn't seem to be helping.,0
This stuff doesn't work very well at all and is very expensive.  There are much cheaper more effective alternatives to this available at most hardware stores.  Absolute rip off.,0
Returned for poor quality.  Not a true Herm Sprenger product.,0
"My vet recommended this supplement for my 9-year-old, 100 lb. Lab. Since we started giving him two tablets with his evening meal, he is clearly more mobile and in less pain. I mix it in with his food and he eats it, so the taste must be OK. Good value for a quality product.",1
Unfortunately the litter-catching lid does nothing when the cat kicks the litter everywhere anyway. I'm disappointed that the litterbox is so low. I'm going to have to return this so I can get a different litterbox that actually works.,0
"I just received this muzzle today, and five minutes later I started a return.  It is very cheaply made with thin flimsy straps and all plastic buckles and clasps.  I would never want to depend on this muzzle, and quite frankly it looks like a dollar store item.",0
"I ended up returning this car seat.  I have a little Yorkie and this did not work at all for her.  After hooking her to this she kept trying to get out and almost choked herself.  This may be okay for a larger animal but not a 4 pound Yorkie.  It is made well, just did not work for me!",0
"When maintaining a planted tank, it is very important to have a well-maintained pH-level. I didn't know about this until I have read about the ideas and suggestions in an aquascape forum. Its good that this product is available here. My uncle bought me this drop checker as a gift since we share the same hobby and he only wanted me to get the best quality for my budget. I am very satisfied with this product.  pH-level of my aquarium is easily monitored now that I have this.",1
"I've bought two of these and neither have worked very well. The first kept sticking at the same temperature and the second I got a few weeks ago has literally just fallen off and gotten stuck to my snake due to the sticky bit on the back. As well as that, the second one also started sticking and wasn't reading correctly. Not buying another one of these.",0
Fast shipping. Too big but that's probably partly my fault.,1
"maybe it would fit the iguana, but not a chicken. grandgirl has a small pet chicken and this would have maybe fit her when she was half grown. maybe.",0
Dogs LVE this flavor!,1
Didn't fit much bigger than described,0
Good value,1
"These were really inexpensive. They aren't loudly scooted around the floor by my dog. But they're pretty weak. The food bowl now has a split down the bottom that had to be repaired. Water bowl is holding up fine.

It worked well for a week and now it's slowly becoming less useful.",0
wayy too small for a ferret,0
It did not phase my dog.  He just kept running.,0
Great extension leash the ribbon is light and wind will blow it but it's great,1
"Cat ate all but the bits of chicken, must have been fake",1
way too small for SUV 2015 Dodge Ram.  Not long nor tall enough.  Measure your seat and check this unit out as it's probably sized more for a passenger sedan or small truck not full size crew cab.,0
"The fish eat it, but it is so light, it floats.",1
Really reduces the bacteria in my dogs mouth. She likes it too!,1
Great.,1
"My dogs just love this item, keeps them entertained.",1
We bough these before and they were great. I purchased another bag and like another reviewer agree they have a very strong odor and looks like there are remnants of stuff on the ears. I will be sending them back. I don't know if I will buy them again.,0
Works well!,1
"This item is for cats or small small dogs.  It is not made for outside at all, your animals will freeze.  Once it is a little wet from your animals etc, it absorbs moisture which is not good for your animals when it's below 70 degrees(spring or fall weather).",0
We use this on our cats at the first sign of fleas and follow up with a flea collar because one of our cats has bad skin reactions to flea drops. The fleas die almost immediately and if followed by an additional flea preventative don't come back!,1
My dogs love these!,1
Great saddle cover. Does its job and looks nice.,1
too small for my 1.5 months cat.,0
"MY HOOMAN BOUGHT ME THIS DOGGY LAWN IN ATTEMPT TO TURN OUR BALCONY INTO A BACKYARD AND TO LIMIT HER TRIPS TO THE DOG PARK DOWNSTAIRS. IM SCARED OF ELEVATORS AND STAIRS SO IT SEEMED LOGICAL. I LOVED MY DOGGY LAWN SO MUCH I DIDNT WANT TO POOP OR PEE ON IT HOWEVER I DID LOVE TO EAT THE GRASSM ROLL AROUND IN IT, AND BRING IT INSIDE. IT ALSO LASTED ALMOST 2 MONTHS OUTSIDE WITHOUT DYING, SO I WOULD LOVE SO MORE GRASS.",1

"I have a very picky eater Maltese with a sensitive stomach - so finding food he'll eat is always a chore. Luckily this Solid Gold stuff is great! It's grain free, and the first few ingredients are, in fact, real meat! My dog gets tired of ANY flavor of food after about 4 lbs, so it's great that I can change up the flavor and actually have choices in grain-free products! So happy with these.",1

"I have used our METPET walking jacket successfully on our Bengal for about 3 months.  However, in the past two days he has backed out of two fasteners , one around his chest the second around his abdomen.  They are snug, not at all loose.

"My dogs love it..We have 2 pit bulls , they are sisters and we did try 2 crates but they would not go in the crate alone lol..so we just bought the biggest one we could find..they love it ..It is huge LOL... its 48"" a lot of room for both of them to lay with no problem..even though most of the time they still lay tangled up with each other even when they are on the love seat with open room they lay tangled up..what can i say these sisters love each other so much....",1
SUPER bed. I have a 130 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback who is getting on in years. I thought I would treat him to a nicer bed. This bed is large enough for him to sprawl out on and it is thick enough that he doesn't bottom out in it.  Nice bed. He loves it.,1
"They cut my cat's nails quickly, easily and painlessly (although they still hate getting it done).  At first I thought they were rather small compared to other clippers I've used, but I actually like this size better. Other clippers I've used would also sometimes not cut cleanly, but these haven't failed me (or them) yet.",1
Piece of junk.  The clasp snapped and broke the second day I had it,0
This leash broke after one week of use.  I'm going to send it back.,0
"Poor fit! Does not work with dog body habitus! I sewed the collar down which helped some, but in the long run... threw them away. :(",0
Don't waste your money on this item. I was able to get the used litter in the special tray only once. I cleaned it out three times and couldn't put it back together. What a waste of money!,0
"great product my dog doesn't hurt hes neck and back bones by reaching too low ..It's stores a lot of dog food ,my white  german shepherd loves it perfect size for him..:)Its darker than the original photo so I posted some pictures..:)",1
These will last forever because thet are too heavy to throw & fly like a rock. Frisbee they are not,0
My Cat was very happy with this he is a big baby and its very sturdy not at all cheap looking made well love it very happy,1
I bought this locally and I am so pleased. My chickens love it and they actually are eating less on this product yet growing. No GMO makes this chicken momma happy.,1
"I have three cats. One needs a grain-free diet, and we recently discovered that one has a chicken allergy. I've always fed all three of them a grain-free, chicken flavored food, but realized that the chicken allergy was what was causing one of the cats to throw up multiple times a day. After switching to this food, the allergy has not been a problem, and she has not thrown up even one time. While this food is more expensive than the previous, grain-free brand I'd purchased, it is 100% worth it to not have to clean up vomit even once a day. My cats seem to enjoy the taste and are always eager to be fed.",1
Made a huge difference when I brought home 2 cats from the shelter to meet my senior dog.,1
Great price -received quickly good quality,1
"The product became more of a issue, than help. I have a dog and I bought this to make my neighbor dog quite,  but when the other dog barked the sound would upset my dog causing him to bark. Maybe it would work for just one dog but with the two it just made things worse.",0
"I have been using Cosequin for a LONG time with our cats. We lost two who used it in 2004 and 2005, but Cosequin granted them a new lease on movement. Where they would no longer play or jump, after 3 or 4 weeks (initial start of Cosequin) they were moving, playing, jumping...

We have a female cat now who has bad hip issues and Cosequin allows her free movement since 2006! I cannout say enough about how well this stuff works. If your cat is getting older or has pain (bone related) issues, try it. Give it 6 weeks and you will see a change!",1
"Punctures all too easily and patching the puncture is not easy. And the patching material included with the product will patch one puncture. That's al. The next one is up to you, and it can be expected to occur soon after the repair.",0
My dad has a huge issue with cats in his yard I bought him this product to try. He put it out in the yard and the cat came and practically layed on it.,0
"I thought this would be my favorite collar, and it was for several years.  I only use it a couple times a year with my 75lb GSD, but always thought of it as sturdy.  Unfortunately, the plastic buckle broke today when she took after a squirrel.

The metal rings are thick and solid, as is the nylon collar itself.  But the weak point is definitely the cheap plastic.",0
"This product was a disappointment. One side collapsed after a day or two, and it had barely been touched by my cat during that time. My cat, who normally loves corrugated cardboard toys, has completely ignored this one :/",0
I love how it looks.  Our dog loves it too.  Perfect bowls for my little guy.  I also love that the bowls have a distance between them.,1
Best money can buy,1
"My cats stayed away from every area I sprayed for days.  Did not do anything, as far as I could tell.",0
Be very careful with this product while it did help slow down my dogs eating he knocked out a front tooth.,0
"This is NOT an extension.  It is a replacement part.  It is identical to the tube that came with the original filter.  It works fine, it fits fine, it's a good part... but it is a replacement part, not an extension or an ""upgrade"" of any sort.",0
"I bought this for my new puppy shes a toy poodle and she just loves this stuff! sometimes i mix it with the wet food (chicken) for some variety but other than that this is great for the price. The bag is really big and so far i still have more than half left it lasts a few months about 3-4 months depending on how much you feed your dog , mine only eats about a hand full.",1
"I feel very weird about this product. First, when I open the box, I found the color is a lot darker than the one I usually bought""light brown"". The one I bought before is exactly same color as the box picture. My dog used to like this product very much, but this ""dark brown"" one she didn't even eat one. To be honest, I don't think the color really matter to the dog, but the taste would. So I think it must be sometime wrong otherwise how would my dog didn't even want to eat it. I'm so disappointed.",0
"We intentionally did not send a photo of our dogs to eliminate the possibility that there would be any guessing on our results. DNA My Dog must have guessed anyway and with no photo reference, they could not have been more wrong.

That's the only explanation for how an 8 pound, short legged, short-haired dog could have been identified as a Lab, American Eskimo, Chow and Irish Setter. It's laughable.

Our 10 pound Schnauzer/Chihuahua mix was identified as a Doberman, Dalmatian, and Norwegian Elkhound.

Our 11 pound terrier mix was called a Pug, Chow, Great Dane, and Catahoula Leopard Dog.

Top heavy and cannot keep it upright. Definitely do not recommend,0
My cats love it & no more upset stomachs.  Thank you Purina.,1
Very cheap quality is very dirty when delivered and is not worth the money would not reccomend to anyone in need,0
perfect - large enough to cover the area in our office for when we are not home. Our little dogs are males and have to target so I over cover - these seem to be very absorbent and don't wet through the edges.,1
"These must taste very good, because they go crazy over these vitamins.  their hair is very shiny, and these pills have garlic, which is excellent for a flea remedy.",1
Our sensitive GSD has so many skin issues and allergies but as soon as we tried this formula about 90% of his issues resolved.  He loves the food and is consistently healthy.  It does lack hip supporting properties so we supplement with other products.  Our pup loves to eat this!,1
"it works pretty well on my glass tank. It gets the algae off. I took a stars off because the handle was pretty short, so I have to get almost to my elbow wet to get to the bottom of the glass. But maybe my tank is deeper then most.",1
"Great quality, I highly recommend this product!",1
"The sizes are way off and they're junk. I have two dogs I ordered one for each of them. A medium and a large. They are off by a size.  I returned the medium and kept the large, but had to buy another collar for my other dog. Good thing I only ended up with one of these though. My dog got this as a Christmas present. She's been wearing it since Christmas morning. The gems are falling out, the clip that holds the charm on it broke and the collar itself is cracking. It looks horrible. needless to say she already needs a new collar.",0
Very nice quality pet carrier.  Seems very sturdy and will  use it tomorrow so will know for sure how nice it is.  Wish the brighter color didn't cost more.  I don't understand that????,1
Do not like. Hard to get on and off and adjust. I prefer the regular choke collars and for my dog training is a better choice. To make this effective you have to adjust the collar after you put on the dog. Seems like it never gets tight enough/or stay snug to be effective. Pain to take off if you don't adjust/loosen. IMHO regular choke collar much more effective when obedience training.,0
Looks just like the picture. Good quality ...,1
Helps my dog a lot,1
"FABULOUS
Brought another male dog into my household and it became a literal pissing match between my other male and him. These have almost quite literally saved their lives. It has saved my sanity without a doubt!!",1
"I received this litter box as a gift for Christmas. My cats pee up against the edge of the box so it is impossible to tilt the box and expect the litter to be sifted in the grate. It is way beyond my comprehension as to why a handle wasn't put on the top of this litter box like other litter boxes. I have had this for one month and was only able to tilt and sift one time for it to work. My advise to anyone is SAVE YOUR MONEY.

Other litter boxes have the handle to lift off and sift out the litter into a scoop. Couldn't be easier. I scrub out my litter boxes once a week. It was difficult to get the screen out. Once out, I had to use a q-tip to clean the screening.

My gift giver said to let him know how it worked and he would get me another one. Absolutely not. I would return this if it was possible. I may put a blanket in it and make a bed for my cats.",0
Might be good for a toothless dog or a small puppy.,0
"I was looking for a baby gate to keep my 1 year old safe from the steps that go down into the basement from our kitchen but would still allow our cat to have access to his food and litter box. The top of the steps has a pocket door but that didn't meet our cat's needs. A regular baby gate was not the answer either, first because the cat couldn't get through and second because every time we wanted to walk down the stairs we had to completely remove it. Getting a good snug fit was tricky and so then I wasn't always comfortable that the gate was secure and safe for my baby. This gate is the answer to all of these issues! We can open the swinging door and walk through when we need to go downstairs and we can always have the pet door open for our cat. Whoever thought of this is a genius!!! Thank you!

And one other note: this product is so reasonable! A gate with walk-thru door only, no pet door, was double the price in Target/Walmart. Can't go wrong with this buy!",1
RABBITS SHOULD NOT HAVE DAIRY PRODUCTS THEY ARE HERBIVORES !!!!!!!!!!,0
Returned it. The buckle to close the collar is huge.,0
"Puppy took to this immediately, each squeaker has a different sound. It is very large and noisy, which she loves. She still has not managed to puncture more than 1 of the squeakers, that means this toy is VERY durable. She is a 90 lb Dalmatian with huge canines, most sqeaker toys only last 1-3 days. Don't plan on peace and quiet with this toy!",1
When your dog tears into it sheds all over.,0
"My cat has lost weight since switching to this product.  She is not eating less, it's just healthier food than what we were buying before.  If you love your cats and want them to be healthy...this is a good choice.",1
"It doesn't launch the ball super far, but the second ball holder and ability to pick up the ball without touching it make up for it. I can keep my dog constantly running after one of the balls. So even if the distance is shorter than I can throw, my dog still gets great exercise.",1
"Be VERY careful when you order this product. The image and description on the first product page is for ADVANCED FITNESS LAMB & RICE. Then you put it in your cart, it CHANGES to the ACTIVE LONGEVITY - which is for much older dogs. I've reported this to Amazon THREE TIMES and they haven't fixed the listing yet or taken it down! As far as I can tell, the error only appears with the 33lb bag. But the smaller bags are WAY WAY WAY more expensive per pound.",0
Disappointed they are manufactured and made in China.  Wish the description would have been more accurate on these Smart Bones.  My dogs love them but I am fearful like so many other treats from China it will cause liver and kidney damage.,0
A bit pricey but cats always seem to enjoy it.  Much less tummy distress & their fur is gorgeous so it's worth it.  Plus with subscribe & save I don't have to remember to order.,1
"According to the measurements listed, my cats covered litter box should fit in this unit. WRONG! Not only did it not fit, it was actually WAY too big. The product is very cheap material and would break easily if you assembled it the wrong way. I think this is a great idea, but unfortunately it's poorly executed. Luckily, Amazon gave me a full refund.",0
Much better hook then the one I had.  Would be 5 stars if hook was bigger to be able to attach to handle of leash.,1
service was fast item are as expected.,1
This toy is a great idea and the potential is there but the rope broke in the first 30 minutes of my dog playing with it. He was supervised the whole time so no unnecessary rough play.,0
Waste of money. Rocky hates it. My 4 month old shitzu baby.,0
"Out of 3 clippers, these were by far the worst. I don't think my shepard/lab's nails are that tough, but they get thick when they are grown out. These twisted the nail to the side while I was trying to cut (even with me recognizing that and trying to keep them very straight). I think this was because they just weren't sharp or heavy duty enough. I did really like the stop, since her nails are black and sometimes its hard to tell where the quick is and how short is too short.

I ended up going with a guillotine clippers, which work so well I can't imagine trying anything else. She'll sit still for those clippers because they don't hurt her as they cut, quickly. I still choose to buff the edges of her nails, but the cut is much cleaner than these ever did.

Bottom line--try more than one style for your dog to determine which is the best for their nails. Don't make nail trimming a painful experience for either of you.",0
"I have received so many comments on this wax burner,it is just perfect.",1
Made in China and will not buy it in the future!,0
"This product didn't make a difference whatsoever.  I wished I would have saved the packaging or paid attention to the date, because now I'm wondering if maybe it was out of date.",0
"I can't say it's really comfortable because I'm not the one wearing it but it looks like it would be.  However when I take it off my dog, she goes crazy rubbing her snout anywhere she can.  I don't use it all the time, depending on the time of day we go out for a walk and I don't keep it on her very long as it shouldn't be on a long time.",1
"I got a cat for the first time in my life a year ago. I did a lot of research and decided to try this system. I brought my kitten home at 8 weeks. She had been trained with the other traditional type litter, but had no problem going straight to and using this box. I just got another new kitten and she did the same thing. I'm a neat freak and can't stand bad smells. This pellet system is phenomenal! The only time you smell anything is when there is a fresh poop and they don't bury it or when the pee pad needs to be replaced. I have found its best to wait a little bit to scoop the poop if its fresh. A few pellets might cling and can just get thrown away with the poop. The pee goes right through to the pad and there is zero odor.

One of the best things I found out is that these can be cleaned and re-used!!! I have a big soup pot designated just to cleaning the pellets. I boil them once a month with a little bleach for about 30 minutes, drain and put them in a large bin to dry out. They stay 100% intact and I have reused the same pellets for 3 months. I just keep a backup set of pellets to put in the litter box while the others are being cleaned / dried out and rotate the sets.",1
2 Stars because when putting it on my dog i pulled up the collar to adjust it and it ripped and i didn't even tug hard. Very cheap material.,0
"The cats roll in it--but must not be strong, the cats are not jumping or running around like they do with other cat nip",0
My pet rabbit likes this product. I recommend this product!,1
"when you get this and put it in, it will not work right away.  just leave it connected and after a day or two it will start working.  after talking with fluval they informed me that this diffuser is not designed to be used with a DIY co2 system,  it is designed for a high pressure co2 cannister with a regulator.  the type of diffuser you should use for a DIY co2 system is a ladder type diffuser.  they said even though you can get this diffuser to work on a DIY lower pressure system it won't be as efficient....after using both systems with mine i would have to agree.",1
"Interesting concept, but fails to deliver results.  It didn't change my cats minds one bit.  Actually, they were more likely to jump on the sofa to check out the new thing.",0
"Fast shipping, great pricing!  Thanks Coolaroo for giving me a chance to replace the cover instead of the whole bed! Now I don't have to worry about my puppy destroying the cover he has now, I have 2 to replace it with!",1
"Our dog starting ripping it apart in less than a week, had to take it away from him since I did not want him eating any of the plastic. Plus made in CHINA, a big NO!!!",0

Not as good as described.  Color is good but quality is flimsy,0

"Sleek and bright.  Excellent lighting system.

Not happy. It has been applied for 3 days now. My dogs still have fleas. Fast shipping.,0
"He didn't really like using this when we were training him for puppy pads. We liked it because it protected our floors and surfaces, but it wasn't really effective in training the dog on it. Your dogs might be different though I'm sure everyone responds differently.  He would tear up on the pads when they were on this so we ended up just throwing it out.",0
"I wish there is a more elegant solution, but this works.. We've started to use them couple of years ago. The new one is made out of a better and softer fabric. I use them with maxi pads, and have few wraps, so that clean is always handy.",1
Used with proper technique this is incredible. We used this with our dog when she was a puppy and now she walks perfectly. A friend asked us to help with her dog and within a few minutes it was walking with a loose leash. It's certainly a two-way learning process as timing is an important part of effective use. It's very well made and looks good as new after two years.,1
The Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers: the entire case was not good. Smelled bad and my dog would not eat. The is the food his has eaten for all ten years of his life. I would appreciate a full refund!,0
dont waste your money,0
Love it,1
Smells nice and effectively stopped itchy skin on my Miniature Dachshund.,1
Love it quiet and now I can leave food down,1
My dogs like the taste. It's great value. This is the second one I ordered.,1
Extremely hard to assemble ! I'm a 29 year old male 185 pounds and it took all I had to get enough leverage to snap the frame completely together once is fabric got tight.,0
"My cat LOVES this stuff, about half the time. I buy it by the case and as soon as I open the first can I know if I got a good one or not. If you see something that resembles a dry hockey puck surrounded by liquid you have basically wasted about $45, as your cat won't go near it. Just got two bad cases in a row. Too bad, as this grain-free diet was really helping him. I might have try to find something else now.",0
"Strength of materials and ability to adjust as my dog has grown are the strongest points of this harness. She's 80 lbs at 8 months (Mastiff/Coonhound mix) and a very strong puller. Fits over her head and the strong clip at the chest make ""dressing"" her smooth and effortless. Lightweight and comfort also great.",1
The kibble seems to drip quite well with this feeder.  I have cats so their kibble is relatively small and I don't know how it would perform with large sized kibble.,1
"I really want to love this.. but the sand person won't stand up straight, the ear holes are too small for my dog... and the velcro straps are too big. I can't imagine what kind of dog this is made for. I have an Australian Shepherd.. not too big, not too small. But this costume would be awesome if it fit right. I gave it two stars because of the idea, minus three stars for the execution.",0
"Love the look. My box came with busted frame. I was so upset. I contacted company who told me to send pictures. I have pictures but can only send though text. Cant find a number to text them

The crate is nice but I wouldnt purchase because if somethings wrong they don't care.",0
"What a RIPOFF REPLACEMENT PART!  This Fluval 405 Magnetic Impeller DOES NOT COME WITH THE CERAMIC SHAFT THAT POSITIONS THE REPLACEMENT IMPELLER and to add insult to injury, this part costs $2.61 MORE THAN THE BETTER MODEL FLUVAL 406 REPLACEMENT MAGNETIC IMPELLER!!!!

"We returned this item. We bought an XL for our 60-lb standard poodle (with medium-length curly coat) and this jacket was way too tight around the neck and chest. The rest fit OK. My recommendation to Touchdog would be to make the neck/chest area more elastic, perhaps with wide velcro closure instead of zipper. The sleeves did not cover the entire leg, just to the elbow (or slightly above). We needed full-leg protection against snow/mud getting in his curly curls. An excellent modification to this jacket would be full-length adjustable sleeves. Otherwise it's a LOT of jacket without much real protection.",0
Didn't even kill one flea!,0
Peter is my go to brand. I was not disappointed. Well balanced and great cut. I am using this trimmer to trim my Bouvier des flandres and they do a great job!,1
Love it!  So much easier to get the undercoat controlled.,1
This is a nice dog bed.  My dogs didn't care for it much as they like ones with sides so it was returned.,1

"I purchased this Puppia harness for my Boston Terrier who likes to pull while walking on the leash.  The harness does not stop the pulling, but at least it put an end to the embarrassing choking noises.  My dog does not mind wearing the harness, as it is very soft and comfortable.  To top it off, I think it is quite stylish.  I am completely happy with my purchase. I would recommend this harness to others who have a small dog.",1
"This is a suede dog toy with a squeaker inside made to resemble a unicorn. The toy looks great and, as a display item, is quite nice. If you've got a dog that doesn't especially chew toys and would like to decorate the space the dog occupies with a cute and nice-looking toy, this is a good choice. If you've got a dog that tends to actually chew its toys, it may not be the best choice. The way it is stiffened makes it work well for display and it does make it easier to hold out to a dog (as it won't flop over).

The main issue is the ropes that make up the main start to fray and come apart pretty quick and can be easily ingested in their stringy state. If you've got a dog which likes to play tug of war and it doesn't have a strong enough jaw or sharp enough teeth to unravel or pull out the strings, then this might work for such a dog. Otherwise, it's really just a good decorative object/dog toy and not great in other respects as it starts to come apart too easily.",0
I love this leash and have had if for about 4 years now. Perfect length snap has held up great would get another if I ever lost mine.,1

"This cat litter smells horrible! It's a cross between menthol and ammonia.

It makes my whole house stink. When ever I return home I need to open the windows and turn on the fan to get rid of the smell.

The front of the box doesn't mention  ""Scented"" anywhere, so we didn't know this stuff was scented when we bought it. On the back of the box, the description vaguely says ""Fresh scent"", which to me means ""baking soda"".",0
Sizing was way off,0
"I took my cat to the vet because of his many trips to the litter box. He was healthy and the vet thought maybe it was stress related. Recently a Bobcat has been visiting the pond in our backyard on a regular bases and probably marks his territory out there as well. We think this is the cause of the stress. Within 2 days of plugging in the Feliway the trips to the box ceased. Then about 5 weeks later it started up again. I checked the plug in and yep it was empty. I ordered a refill and the trips ceased within 2 days.
So YES it really does work!",1
"I researched many different kinds of cat trees before deciding on this one. It looked ""Beautiful"" and well made. When it was delivered and my husband put it all together, I was so pleased that the picture looked just like the Cat Tree. Our three cats LOVE IT!! We set it up in front of a large window where our cats can view the outside world. To introduce the tree I placed kitty treats on it, a little cat nip and played with the cats every morning. Soon this tree became a favorite climbing, scratching, and resting place for all. It was especially stimulating for the two ferrel cats we have rescued.

"I was really surprised how much my very picky cat, Feather, loved these tablets.. This is the first hairball treatment that I've found that she will actually eat and she eats them with relish! I just break them in half (they are rather large and it makes them easier for her to chew) and put in front of her and they're gone.. Now, I wasn't kidding when I said my cat is picky.. Have you ever known any cat that wouldn't eat fresh Tuna or would turn their nose up at fresh meat of any kind? The only food Feather eats is Purina Indoor Cat food.. She won't look at anything else.. It certainly makes it easier for me but I still find it odd.. She's the only cat I've ever owned that doesn't like Tuna on occasion.. Anyway, I can't recommend this product and Vet's Best Urinary Tract Support tablets enough.. She loves both..",1

"When we adopted our Russian Blue from a stranger that posted an ad for her, she was 2 1/2 yrs old. The previous owner said she didn't like the owner's boyfriend, so she was FTGH. This poor girl must have had a rough time bc she was so skittish and hissed at everyone but me. She definitely didn't like my husband, to the point of  almost lunging at him. I decided to try this calming spray. It took some time, about 2-3 months, but today she is happy and healthy and LOVES my husband!",1

How could this be that good at such a reasonable price?  I tried it and my dogs love it!",1

They are just the smaller points of an antler.

I have one very small dog and though the size would be correct the fact that they are NOT split as described makes it useless when trying to give a very small dog a good surface to encourage them to chew, and give their teeth a good natural cleaning.",0
Large is not for a large dog.,0
Kills fleas.,1
Didn't last long with my dogs.  Maybe 60 minutes...,0
Cute shirt. Washes nicely. However runs small in size.,1
Stoped working after a week,0
The clasp on this leash is very hard to work with.  Poor choice.,0
We have two Pomeranian's and have mixed their old food with the new food.  The past two weeks neither dogs has eaten it.  They pick it out and drop it on the floor.,0
"This is a great product, especially for older dogs like mine.  They aren't thrilled about the taste so I just put a thin dab of butter around them and they eat it up.  Delivery is quick.  Price is better than most, but I do wish they would cost less.",1
"The dog (a 6-year old Weimaraner who is a voracious chewer) liked these just fine. In less than 10 minutes, the first of the two was devoured.

Life span does not compare favorably with real antlers.",0
Double flap helps keeps weather outside.  Easy installation.  Has a door that slides and clicks so it will lock when you leave for extended periods or  need to keep an animal outside/inside the door.  Does stick out from the door a couple inches but isn't a big deal to us.,1
The fan worked great but was too powerful for my 120 gallon tank.  I have a bowfront and it was blowing the sand around everywhere.  I tried to aim the fan in different directions but eventually I gave up and purchased a smaller fan.,1
"These emit a horrible odor, something like a mix of fresh tar and formaldehyde.  We put them in the garage for about 6 weeks to air out.  While they are better, it is still noticeable when you are near them.  Too cheap to return, going in the trash.",0
Perfect for my rabbits.,1
"This toy has in fact stayed intake, which for my dog, a 78 lb Labrador, is a miracle. So for the toy being durable, yes it is. The size is wonderful. It is about 3-4 ft long and about 8 inches wide, and she can really wrap her mouth around the toy, and swing it, and drag it. She loves it, and though she can't write a review, she would give it five stars. There seems to be no filling to fall out, and it the toy is very soft. The only down fall, and this is if that is an issue for you personally, is that the toy is a huge squeaky toy. That means the noise of insane. The noise seems to make her happy so when it gets to be too much we just switch out the toy. I highly recommend, and your dog if a large dog will love this. I would not think this toy would work for smaller breeds.",1
Awaom,1
"My dog isn't a fan of peanut butter (weird) but she still loves to play with the kong. I stuff it with treats, honey and bell peppers. You can find suggesting recipes to stuff in the kong online.",1
Very effected........one week to correct behavior !!!!!,1
Great,1
"If at all possible do not try to treat a UTI for a male cat without getting him checked out by a vet.  It could be a life threatening condition.  That said, this is a great product.  My young adult male cat (under 2 years old) began peeing in inappropriate places, constantly, with only a small amount of urine (often bloody) produced.  Classic UTI symptoms.  Went to the vet, who loaded him up with water (under his skin)to verify he could pee OK.  After determining he was not completely blocked, although he had some crystals in his urine, they treated him with anti-biotics(shot).  They tested the ph of his urine and it read 8 (top of the scale) so they recommended Methigel to acidify his urine. I mix it with a small amount of wet catfood and he is fine with it. If you have just one cat, get some litmus paper and keep an eye on your furry pal's ph.  You might be able to get by with less than the recommended dose. BTW the price on Amazon is half what I paid the vet.",1
"The idea is great, but it fails on a few levels. 1) The over-lap of shelves is too short for adult cats. Difficult to move from one tier to another. 2) The scratchy back-post is useless since cats can't stretch upward to use (no reach room between shelves). 3) VERY difficult to assemble. 4)Adding Catnip gives the only real attraction, thus the shipping box was a better draw. We even attached it to a door that has a top window overlooking a bird's nest...they still rarely climb. Were this not SO hard to assemble, we would have dis-assembled and shipped back. Again, great idea with tweeks to design.",0
Its very sturdy but it said medium but i was def a small my dog is to big for it and my dog is a meduim dog,0
"Super thin.....doesn't even work for my 4 pound yorkie, purchased them to fit in my potty pad holder, don't fit.  Will not purchase again.  Very disapointed, I guess you truly get what you pay for.",0
"After about a month the LED lights became very dim and lost all their brightness, even after the collar had been charged for over 48 hours. After about a 5-6 weeks the collar could no longer hold a charge for more than 5 minutes (after having charged it for several days) and would just stop glowing.

We selected this product based on the reviews it received and decided to spend the extra dollar for a good product. However, for as much as we paid for, I would have expected a better and longer lasting product. This one is now heading for the trash..",0
"After having two beagles who never scratched, our newest rescue hound proved all too ready to ruin our freshly-replaced custom front door. I had made a temporary protector using a sheet of cardboard, but this works so much better. I cut an opening to give access to the deadbolt latch, which also helps hold the shield steady. Saved our door -- and our dog -- a lot of grief!",1
This product did not deter my poodle one bit. It didn't have any impact on the neighbor's dog either.,0
Cat will not eat,0
"I don't usually write a review but this item came missing legs. Come on people. Now I have the hassle of shipping it back. Just to comment on previous reviews left by other people, it is very small, more for a kitten, but that didn't bother me since my cats tend to find the smallest place they can possibly fit in for a nap.",0
"This brush is very nice to use for our groomer.  It helps get the undercoat brushed out well.  Some dogs, wow, you can make a whole new dog out of the hair you get out with this brush.",1
"One cat loves it, one cat doesn't really use it (might be scared when it moves around on the door handle).  Based on the dirt-cheap price, I'll probably be buying more to disperse around the house.",1
After buying this I found out I needed to check for amonia and nitrates. The pH tester comes with the master test kit and I found this to be a waste of money,0
My fault.,0
not only is it hilarious on its own....but watching your dog carry around this bottle by the cap is unrealistically hilarious. and walking into your living room to find this bottle sitting upright is just fantastic,1
This stuff works great in getting the gunk out of the dog' ears using this and some cotton pads like the ones the wife uses for makeup removal.  The price is right and this product works well.  Recommend.,1
Absolutely love the collars and a lot cheaper than in our local pet stores.,1
"Horrible customer service and not much better product.  I work with foster dogs and had an18# dog bust the wires.  So obviously not sturdy.  As it was past 30 days Amazon didn't warranty but gave me the number for Rowland Direct.  I called that number, they referred me to another number. I called and left a message.  no response.  I called again and was told to call ANOTHER number.  left message. no response.",0
this product does not work. dog still has fleas after several treatments,0
My 9 week old Sheltie mix loves it!,1
Used this on our 33 year old appaloosa who had super thin soft soles.  It worked great!  After 30 days the vet and farrier could not believe the improvement.  He was ready for shoes again.,1
My chinchilla and my rabbit both love them. Nice and thick so they aren't destroyed in one day! Will be ordering again when I need them!,1
Dog is not crazy about this product.,0
"Perfect, I board dogs and occasionally have to transport, I have harnesses specifically for car transport but this also fits and works with most harnesses, gives them room to move around but not too much, can be shortened or lengthened, telling all my clients to seatbelt their dogs in, too dangerous not to",1
These are perfect for keeping a dog in-check while camping or outdoors away from home.  Not as heavy or abrasive as a chain. I have a 15 and 20 foot version.  Both work great.,1
"useless, does not do much of anything. I would give it less than one star if I could. better to take your money and use it as fire wood than to buy this!",0
"I bought this pan just over two years ago, and for most of that time it was great! However, today I moved it aside to clean up spilled litter and discovered that it has apparently sprung a leak... I guess there goes my apartment security deposit.",0
Half of my cat fit into this thing (he's 13lbs) - they must only show it with kittens.,0
"Good quality, appears to be comfortable for my dogs.  Looks good. Easy to put on.  I would buy this again.",1
this is great toy and the pigs love chewing on it.,1
"Bought this item at WalMart because of the price.
Our Dog is an overweight Rat Terrier that weighs about 35 pounds
Item is Easy to apply but does have an odor and is unusually oily. I applied at several spots along her spine.
Have not seen any allergic reactions so far.
Product Did NOT keep the fleas off our dog with the first application. We live in a metro area, our dog is a house dog and not exposed to other animals.
I have been disappointed so far with the first treatment but Will try again once more since I have invested the money.",0
These are so much less expensive on Amazon we will restock here again. The dogs love the toy they fit into. Hours of entertainment.,1
Very well made carrier. Strong zipper and straps. A little tedious to put on when pet is moving all four legs. This should get easier with practice. Very satisfied.,1
It is a bit pricey for just 2 test strips. I got a damaged /open kit but it was replaced with no problem. If it had more strips for the price I would have given it more stars.,0
"Cat had no idea what to do with it.  Good idea, but
obviously not acceptable to all felines.  NIce try.",0
"I have a hard time finding a shampoo that doesn't make our westie itchy, even with very thorough rinsing. This shampoo smells nice (not overly strong), cleans well and doesn't irritate her skin.",1
This product caused significant chemical burns to the necks of my two cats.,0
"I bought this item a year ago and went back today to recommend to someone else and thought I should write a review; highly recommend! She uses this all the time, this thing is super sturdy! She's gained a bit of weight since I got her spayed and this post does not falter, she still climbs on top of it like a gargoyle. The scratching material still looks brand new after a full year of use and now another cat using it. I have a feeling this will last us a very long time! Do not waste money on a slightly cheaper post, this one will last.",1
"Others have posted about how well this product works, but my cats won't touch food with it in it, and I certainly won't squirt into mouth when it has a faint ""alcohol"" odor to it.",0
"My dog loves this bed.  It fits perfect in our Midwest crate.  My pup is only 5 months and hasn't tried to chew it at all.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is when I washed it, it got stuck on the rubber gasket at the top.  It ripped the corner off a little too easily.  We are just going to sow it, but seems to rip pretty easily.  Beware of washing it and make sure it is no where near the top where it can get stuck.",1
THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE PRICE !,1
"The photo shows a circuit breaker type electrical plug, which was my deciding factor when I choose this heater.  BUT the photo is incorrect; just a standard plug on this heater.",0
"This is just the right size for my full grown cat.  It was very easy to put together.  Although it does move some when my cat jumps on the higher levels, he doesn't seem to mind (my cat is afraid of everything).  I would definitely recommend this.",1
This is not what I received.  Mine has florescent orange plants.  I have attached a picture.  I hate that you cannot choose the style.,0
"After a few weeks my Dalmatian cross still loves this and it still has all limbs (minus tail) lasted much longer than other ""cute"" toys we've purchased...good bang for buck!",1

does not work,0
So far Dottie and Toto haven't complained... must be OK...,1
"I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty ticked off. It's a pretty tank, I will give it that, but what good is ""pretty"" when it kills your fish and frustrates the snot out of you?

Basically here's my chief complaints with this tank. there is no lid, which originally I didn't like, but not listening to my inner instinct and listening to the pet store at which I accquired this tank, I picked this up. I did get used to lid-less-ness although having to refill it every other day became a drag. Then came the day when my skepticism about not having a lid came into light. I had two african dwarf frogs in the tank and they ""disappeared"" one day. Sure enough, they ended up OUTSIDE of the tank. Dead. Probably because you have to keep the water level so high to keep the filter happy.

Secondly, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, this tank's power supply keeps shorting out. I'm on my second one which lasted TWO WEEKS. you unplug it to do a water change and BAM no more power to the filter. know what that results in? I do... fish that are freaking out because they cannot breathe and jump out of the tank... because there's no lid. then they die as well.

Basically I got a new Marineland and will let you know how much better that one is. But as for this... pretty definitely doesn't mean practical and if you're into torturing your fish, then pick this one up.",0
"Stop looking. Buy this box, it is hands down the best available... Well, unless you enjoy scooping poop? This litter box takes the whole nasty experience to a much nicer level.  It's clean too, which I did not expect.  My 13lb cat fits just fine. I would recommend one box for each cat. I admit, it is an eyesore, but at least its covered, and afterall, its a litter box.  I've tried the cabinets, the dome, the fake tree (my previous favorite); this took the cake after the first box cleaning. Sold.",1
"Looks like the free toy you get in a cereal box  not what I expected at all from my ""Large Dog Accessory Search""",0
"To be honest I got these quite a while ago so I may forget exactly what it was I did not like , only that I was afraid to let my small/medium dog have it .  either I got the wrong size, or it made me worry he'd choke.  I gave it away to someone else, with a bigger dog and told them why I did not want my dog to have it, and to supervise if they were going to give to their dog.",0
Super for a 21 inches deep tank.,1
"I probably got some from a bad batch, because no matter what I use there for, they leak. It happens with water, air, CO2, etc.",0
"I have a small Beagle (dog pictured) and she will not fit in this bed. The top covers the entire top and dose not stand up as shown. I wish it would have met my expectations as my dog loves to burrow. I ended up giving the bed away to someone with a Yorkie, so not to deal with returning.",0
I only buy these at Amazon for both our aquatic turtle and now hermit crabs.  They last so much longer and the best value - much better than the pet store.  The 2 bulb pack guarantees I have one on hand when I need it.,1
"My cat looks adorable in this, however the white is painted on and chips easily, I've only owner for a month and about 30% of the paint is gone.",1
"I ordered 2 of these and 1 has already died...frozen up and canno, even physically make it spin.",0
Fish love it.,1
"We spent $50+ on a larger bed from PetCo that fit all 3 of our beagles (they like to sleep in a pile). Less than a month later, they had dug a hole through the top of the bed and pulled foam pieces out of the hole. The cover for that bed didn't come off, so there wasn't really any way to wash/repair it.
I had noticed a reviewer said something about if you have dogs that dig, this bed would be shredded. I would say that is based on your particular dog as none of our 3 (7 years, 5 years, and 1 year) have shredded this, they like the orthopedic foam, and have used it strictly for sleeping/snuggling/playing, but haven't dug a hole through the fabric in the 2 months that they've used it. It's not quite as large as I would like, but it's stood up better that the more expensive bed, so I can't complain.",1
I finally found a harness that is big enough for my Labrador and my German Sheperd! Pretty happy and satisfied!,1
I think a flow pump should last longer than 2 months..  Mine broke by going into reverse mode vacuum because of the reverse it detached itself from the side of the tank turning it into a wrecking ball for my fragile corals.. destroyed at least 2 expensive ones. Horrid return policy on amazon and now once again I'm stuck with garbage that breaks days outside of the return window.. these things are supposed to last years... Luckily amazon was kind enough to accept this return. thank you.,0
"Lt. Aldo Raines, a large, beautiful yellow lab can now go with me everywhere in the back of the new truck. Growing older had meant him not having a lot of trips off the property, leaving him depressed. Now he's back to being a very happy dog!",1
i used these every day for over a year and really didn't see where they helped. now i use 1 teaspoon twice a week of liquid cod liver oil and i can see a difference. my dogs hair is baby soft and not dry and shedding/falling out like before.,0
Works well. My dog usually inhales his food in 1 minute or less. This bowl slows him down considerably. It now takes him 4 to 5 minutes to eat his food. He's even starting to loose weight. ;),1
this is cool use it every day for years!,1
My dog loves this toy.  She can go thru a few of these in a day if we let her.  The only problem is that she figured out how to chew them off the toy in about 1 minute.  So we tend to go thru a lot of them.,1
Makes scooping much easier.,1
Extension makes walking the two dogs easy.,1
"This bed was great-looking, my dog loved it...until I had to wash the cover.  Under gentle, the patchwork all came apart.  What dog bed does NOT have to be washed???  She's now lying on the inside part & is just as happy.  Me, not so much.",0
my cat love these!,1
I sprayed this on a cat toy which was suppose to have catnip inside.  They still would not play with it.  Sniffed it a couple of times and walked away.  I guess it's not very strong.,0
Came here on time but didn't work had to send back,0
I read the reviews and the questions before buying the X-Large to make sure an ENTIRE 37.5 lb. bag of kibble would fit.  They said it would take up to a 40 lb bag. so I bought it.  I spent 139.00 only to have yet another container that doesn't hold the entire bag.  So bummed.  (Purina Pro Plan),0
"Dog completely destroyed this in about 15 minutes.  If you dog is easy on beds this is ok but if they like to chew, avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
"I specifically bought this item because it came with a free PINK bag dispenser. the dispenser is a twist to close and easily clips to my leash or flash light. the bags are strong. I have not have one rip yet and I grab whatever is underneath the poo too! Super fast shipping, when I run out I will definitely buy more!",1

"I have two ferrets at the moment, a near-3-year-old and a near 6-month-old. Both eat up different ferret chew-toy treats in mere moments, and they also seek out to try and gnaw on textures similar to these Marshall SuperChews, so I thought this item sounded perfect! I thought the texture would make the chews last longer than the others I've tried...well, I got my wish I suppose. Neither ferret will touch them, any of them. I tried everything it said on the packaging to encourage the ferrets to try them, nothing. I even tried my own tricks to get the ferrets to give them a try and even after getting them to briefly nibble they were still completely uninterested.",0
"Came broken, read the reviews. Should have passed on this order but I thought it was cute! Sitting here glueing it together now.  :0(",0
"My dog is terrible when it comes to eating. He will eat anything and everything... except for this food. I ended up donating it so it wouldn't go to waste. I was really excited about it because it sounded nice, but it just wasn't meant for him.",0
"I followed instructions and read a lot of reviews to make sure the product is safe for my family as I have 3 years old toddler. Per instructions, it states it is safe to use around kids. After I applied powder on my carpets, I had to book a hotel room to spend the night with my family because it was hard to breath in the house. Next day I vacuumed all my carpets twice to make sure the powder is partially removed. At 5am I was woken up from hearing my toddler had had time breathing, like having some spasms in his throat. My sister also mentioned having difficulty breathing. I had to call 911 b/c my baby was nonresponsive, drooling saliva, and gasping for air. Non of my family members have any respiratory problems. Thanks God, everything turned out fine. BUT, I had to remove ALL my carpets and place new hardwood flooring.
Conclusion: Be careful using this product. Boric acid might seem harmless, but in large amount it can be dangerous even in totally healthy individuals.",0
We adopted a rescue pup from Georgia and he loves the fabric crate with screen. Very sturdy and he will grow into the crate.,1
"Was a good product but recently they added polyethylene glycol to it which causes stomach upset, gas, loose stools and appetite suppression. None of which are good for a nursing mothers dog.",0
I received this collar however was not impressed so I had to order another one from a different company this collar is currently in the dog drawer in case of emergency,0
"This mat works great, I just wish it was a bit bigger! It does capture the litter very well and is very cute. I would recommend, just keep in mind the dimensions!",1
"JFYI this is an older model.  I looked at newer and was disappointed to find this one does NOT have the combination feature... where 1 button will deliver a sequence of tone, vibration, the electric stimulus.

Otherwise, it is easy to use and set up.  Plenty of help on website... but does not quite match this 1st revision product.",1
"Wonderful product! I recently bought a leash with no shock absorber. I was getting yanked around everywhere. Now, I can barely feel my pup.",1
Product is made of quality material.  Seems to be very durable.  Should last a long time.  Fits my back seat perfectly.  Very satisfied with this product.,1
As advertised,1
Way smaller then expected. Got it for my rottie. Gave it to my sisters Italian greyhound,0
"Love this cat litter box. I have two cats that love to throw litter around. While this didn't cut the litter on the floor down to nothing, it definitely took a substantial chunk out. Keeps the smell down and no one has to see the little presents left behind. The dome has a modern look to it and doesn't take up as much space as you think it would. I have not had the same issues as others with the lid coming off or urine leaking through. The top piece did come cracked (whoever packaged this thing did not put any type of cushioning into the box. I didn't really care because it was easy enough to glue back together and....it's a litter box....

More color choices would have been nice.",1
The dog loves this toy but as with every toy you buy it last for about 2 minutes then they move on to something else lol.,1
Exactly as I expected it to be except the box it was shipped in was huge! At least you won't miss it when it arrives.,1
I like that you can suction cup it to the side of the tank. My betta enjoys swimming and occasionally hiding around the plant.,1
"So far so good. My four cats seem to love this food they come running every time. I like that the resealable ""zipper"" is holding up to constant use as well. Very handy.",1
Tried this collar and it doesn't seem to be working right. It won't let me adjust sensitivity levels and constantly beeps and zaps my dog when she is doing nothing but laying on my lap. Had to take it off and not use it at all.,0
"stick is to short, I'm 5'10"" and I have a bad back and I still have to lean over to use this, also it does not work very well. You can not just scoop it, you have to move turds around until they go into the bag, picking up by hand or other ways is by far faster, if it had teeth it would be a good deal, The quality of this product is not worth the money.",0
"Seems to be a good product, but they've been in the news for lying about what's in their food. They claim the main product is chicken meal and that they don't use chicken by-product. Turns out they do, if they lie about that, they'll lie about the rest of the ingredients. I'm switching to Orijen.",0
I would order this again,1
Works very well,1
"I have 1 cat,  2 dogs and small apartment,  this product has been GODSEND. My cat is lung haired and old she throws up often before I found this product no matter what I use I just couldn't get the smell out, with anti icky poo all I have to do is get up the mess and spray it down and after a Couple days I smell nothing I've never seen anything like it!",1
Hi Im is Bizzy and my Mom got me dis here ball befor I no how to spel!  I be 12 yrs and I tink I always had dis one.  Mom say dis one is #3!  I do lots of work for dis ball an I aways no were it hides!  I LOV MY TWEAT BAL FUREVA!  I play dead doggi for it!,1
I purchased these a few months ago and they were the plastic springs. They were wonderful and the cats loved them.  I just ordered another set and what arrived are crappy metal springs in flaking paint.  This is totally unacceptable and I'm sending them back today.  Hello Amazon: talk to this supplier!  What they have listed and what they are shipping are two different things.  If it was possible I'd give zero stars. DO NOT BUY THESE!,0
It is a pain in the neck to fill and is noisy. My cats preferred their other fountain to this one.,0
Bought only to try now using another company,0
"i love that the ball is actually RED instead of PINK like in the picture! :)

And yes, it's helping me saving the sofa JUST A LITTLE..",1
"My dog loves these, he has to do some actual chew, and doesn't give him gas like many cheaper products. Great bully bone",1

"My cat is a picky eater and won't do pate, only chunky cat food. This stuff Is the cheapest chunky cat food I've found that has good ingredients. I've gotten most of the flavors and my cat seems to like all of them!",1
"I have two models of the Pioneer Fountain, and I will post this on both.  This is by far the worst brand of pet fountain that I have ever owned.  The filters do little to catch anything.  Hair floats around in the drinking bowl and does not get picked up by the filter, yet some gets by the filter and into the pump.  Saliva is not filtered out of the water at all, so the bowl gets nasty very quickly.  On top of the poor performance, I have had to replace a pump in one bowl, and a power supply on the other, and I have only owned these units for four months.  If you are looking for a bowl that will need constant cleaning and repairs, this is the one for you!",0
My cat didn't like this product.,0
Arrived broken so cannot rate,0
"I've tried everything available in the market for my shih tzus, nothing worked. I was about to consider the tear duck surgery because the fur around their eyes were stained dark brown and constantly wet, which they hate it.  I love this product. After a month treatment their hair is mostly dry with much less brown stain and I can tell they feel much better.",1
Will not order again.,0
"This product is not worth $7.96. I have not yet given it to my parrot because her cage is not here yet and I would like for it to be a part of the new set up. However just on appearances alone I don't think the product will last more than a week. It is frail- the materials won't last long. The ropes on it are very small in size. It looks as if they took a giant rope and untwined it into medium and smaller sections and attached it. The green straw bristles at the top are practically sliding out, so I know by the first day it will be completely gone. The wood like coil has one jumbo plastic bead and that doesn't move much. Overall I would not recommend this product and I hope you use this money to purchase higher quantities and qualities of bird toys because for this price I could have shopped on a brand website and got at least two or three items for my quaker.",0
bought this item in january now we are in May and item is ni longer charging :(,0
Very good and accurate it took a couple days to get it right,1
Very good to train your pet. My baby learned fast and no more poo poo or pee every where in my house. It really works just have to be dedicated to your pet.,1
"work for the first 2-3 days and then the dog stopped responding to the sound.  the red light still comes on when the dog next door barks and I have the birdhouse right in front of the fence where the neighbors dog likes to sit and bark but the dog must not care anymore about the noise.  it must not work on all dogs, especially little yappers.",0
"This is a sturdy, solid brush that works great for brushing your pets.  I like it for the simple fact that it's all one piece and it won't break like so many of the other cheaply made brands.  My cats beg for me to use this brush on them.",1
"I am (was) on my third drinkwell water fountain, 1 from PetSmart, 1 through Chewy dot com, and 1 from Amazon dot com.  All of them have had a very short time period working, (just over 1 year), but, they have been excellent at what they did.  Same problem with all three, the filters quit.  They just stopped running.  I have all the residual parts, including many charcoal filters, (resulting from not taking time to re-organize my subscription)!  The thing is, I was manic about doing was surface cleaning (every week on Tuesday), AND the deep clean (Every other Tuesday).  Filter changed 1st cleaning of each month.  When something was accidentally dropped into bowl  , (at least once a month, it seemed!), the unit got unplugged, dumped of fluid, rinsed & re-filled with her (Tabitha's) spring water.  (DANGER-  spoilers ahead in my dissertation regarding care of animals (indoors)!:  I am extremely fussy about my cat(s), they are each raised with great care, because I want to maximize their lifetime.  My last two cats lived for 19 years (Taco), & 20 & 3/4 years ( Samantha).  I do NOT consider this the ""luck of the draw"".  I feed wet food several times per day, & I put out about 1/3 cup of dry, (for the day), as I learned from Guide Dogs for the Blind Chief Veterinarian, San Rafael, CA., ""domesticated animals need both type foods (wet & dry) available for optimum lifetime renal nutrition.""  To avoid contamination of her food, I use plastic disposable bowls within her ""cutsie"" bowl.  It's changed morning & afternoon, rinsed & cleaned out, & washed by dishwasher (apartment sized) at the end of the week when there are enough for a separate load.  I play with her 3 times daily (minimum,Taco & Samantha, as well, during their lifetimes) with a laser light, & a pole with a toy suspended (tons, all with fabulous results except one purple jobby that scares the poop  out of Tabitha!)!  Tabitha gets on my lap as often as she can (especially since my daughters went in and ""bought"" bi-weekly manicures for me, which I didn't care for at first, but Tabitha LOVES!!!)!  She used to get up about 2-3 times a day(during my breaks), but now (since longer nails on me, she makes it up about 5-6 times a day!  I give her treats twice a day, number is determined by how much dry food has been consumed, how active she's been & how many she's already conned out of me, so far.  The active play is SO important for cats (&dogs!), since that's what gets their heart rates up.  My big theory about cats is:  two cats are two cats, one cat (at a time), is a pet.  I have been so ""fortunate"" to have been physically challenged enough to have time to ""bring up"" my last 3 furry friends!!!  They give me MUCH more in love and fun times, than I could ever give them.  Samantha, in particular, HATED whenever she saw me on the floor (accidentally!), or in pain, whether obvious or intuitive.  Tab's 8 years old this month, what a blessing she and ALL my furry friends have been!!!  If I traveled with them, I'd have had any & all of ""my"" cats  named ""service animals.  That were each THAT incredible!!!

BTW...a recent reviewer mentioned how to avoid slime in standing water  bowls.  You are correct about avocado  seeds have an enzyme that prevents spoilage.  If you eat an avocado  and have a leftoverhalf, just put the seed back in & cover with plastic wrap.  On the same thread, to keep your guacamole from browning, keep a pit or two in the bowl  with the guacamole, to also avoid browning.  HTH",0
Would love to shake the hand of whoever invented these! Soooo practical! We use ours every time we leave the house with the beast (dog). Have used ours almost daily for over a year and it's as good as new.,1
"The tubing is described as ""standard"", however I found that the inner diameter of the tubing was small and was incompatible with all my other ""standard"" airline pieces (e.g., air pump, air stones, 3-way tees, etc., etc.).  There was no way to get this tubing, which is also somewhat rigid, to stretch and go over the plastic nipples on other airline components.  This tubing was completely useless, and I ended up just throwing it away.",0
"My dog did not like it, product was very stale.",0
love love love these! I just bought four more. They really work! They make Paws so soft. and it smells so good. My doggo wants to try to eat it every time! It's hard to make him not to :p,1
great product! does the trick to keep things fresh in the can overnight.,1
"EDIT: Well mine made it 4 years before trying to kill my fish. Noticed this morning my tank temp was over 95 degrees. But something else.

Original review: Works fine to heat a 55 gallon tank with. The temperature indications on the thermostat dial are way off though. Make sure you use a real thermometer. It does hold a steady temp, just not the one indicated.",0
"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ThunderLeash-Pink/dp/B01A77DF98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ThunderLeash - Pink</a>&nbsp;We purchased this leash for a 17 pound Puggle. This dog will pull and lunge at other dogs but just because she wants to say hello, not because she is aggressive. She is very stubborn. We have tried numerous no pull harness's on her but they did not fit her because of her stocky torso. A friend of ours had this leash for his dog and we were impressed. I can actually say that Sadie is a transformed dog now when walking because of this leash. We feel as if we have better control over her and it seems to give her a bit of comfort with the part that goes around her chest.
That being said, I have a concern about that part of it. If you can see from the first photo, it is starting to fray around the edges and we do not know how long it will last. This is very sad as it is less than 30 days old! The second photo shows the other part of it that goes attaches to her collar.
Will post back as time goes on. We really do like it but....As much as we paid for this leash, I am very disappointed. It will not last a year. It is turning black at the spot where it slides through the buckle part. Not only is it discoloring but it is also fraying and looks terrible. Wish I had done some more research on this leash...",0
"Our older English Bulldog rescue, Gertrude LOVES this bed.  We have to constantly wash it and it has held up perfectly. Looks like new every time it comes out of the wash!  The material on the outside of the bed is SO SOFT.  I almost want to keep it for myself!",1
"Not at all useful for a cat with very fine long fur.  Even being very gentle and trying to work with the design of the blades, they just don't cut.  This could be a great product if the blades were actually sharp.",0
Lasts a long time. I have bulldog mixes and a lab/dane mix and after a few mths these nylabones are still in good condition.,1
My dogs love this but I've had to buy it repeatedly because they figure out how to separate the two pieces and chew them up. It would be better if it was one solid piece.,1
Couldn't resist it since cat in ad looks like mine's twin.  She loves it. Little high in $$ but worth it.,1
"I got tired of paying the groomer tons to do this treatment with my dog, so I got a furminstor to use at home. I've been pleased so far! We wash our dog and use the furminator every week and it has dramatically cut down on shedding.",1

Worked wonders on my pugs noses!,1
Our greyhound definitely likes the taste of this supplement!,1
This tube will not fit onto any air pump . It is way too small I took it with me to PetSmart to see if it would fit any of the bubblers or air pumps there and I could not get it on any of them.  It should not be listed as standard airline tubing when I couldn't get it to fit properly on anything.,0
great product. quick service.,1
"I bought this crock for my ferret to have in addition to his water bottle. Needless to say, he loves it and loves to drag it all over his cage when it's empty (his way of letting me know it needs a refill). However, my only complaint is that it doesn't lock tight; so my ferret can knock it out of place very easily. Other than that it's a great water/food bowl for any small animal.",1
My 13 year old shih tzu got mange.  Her immune system is compromised due to many other health problems.  This shampoo helped so much with the huge sores all over her body.  Wet your dog and foam up the shampoo. Let it sit on your pet for 10 minutes and rinse.  Do this twice a week. Avoid eyes and face. I wear gloves as it can be hard on your hands. Also it can bleach clothing so don't wear anything you are worried about ruining.,1
My cats think this is stupid and want nothing to do with it.  They will not walk under it or even rub up against it.  The little furry ball that comes with it comes apart way too easily.  One of my cats had wads of it in his mouth within seconds.  I was afraid he was going to swallow it and have a big problem.  The catnip coating is very light and really doesn't affect the cats.  The carpet portion is like velcro and harbors tons of cat hair.  The hair embeds itself in the fibers and won't even vacuum out.  This was really just a waste of money.  I'm glad it was inexpensive.,0
Our bunny loves this,1
Great,1
"WASH IT!!! Time consuming: yes. If you don't wash first, your water will be black/gray cloudy for a while. Take the time to wash it. Snails don't seem to be effected by it. Looks great, and better than regular gravel for plants.",1
Made and processed in the USA however ingredients come from outside the US including china according to an email received from the company after I inquired about it.,0
We have had gold fish for over three years and they were huge and doing great. Our pump was old so we bought this one to replace it before it crashed. Within a week all three of our gold fish were dead. This is the ONLY thing we changed in the aquarium and followed as they were written. My wife is very upset!,0
The perfect sand pail. In an effort to avoid plastics I bought this pail for our Caribbean cruise. He loved it!,1
"I have only used this product twice so I don't have an opinon on the effect yet, however I hate the smell. It is a very strong smell that is almost sickening. I will try to find something to add to to mask the smell but I won't order this again.",0
"I have wanted a bird bath fountain for years but never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars.  My daughter spotted this for me after my solar fountain disappointed.  Placed this in the bird bath in an inch or inch and a half of water (typical bird bath depth), attached a 1/2"" plastic tube, set an upside- down 5"" matching flower pot with a drainage hole over top (more pieces of tubing slit down the middle and slipped onto the pot edge keep it lifted enough for water to flow beneath) and set an 8"" matching saucer with a 1/2"" hole drilled through the center on top. (Use a masonry bit for drilling)  Plugged this in and it works beautifully!  The lowest flow setting on the dial keeps this bubbling up but not splashing out of the bird bath.  This would run continuously if I didn't have to stop it to clean little feathers and dirt off the grill, which makes it run more slowly, naturally.  The birds are thrilled with it, especially robins and sparrows.  We have a robin that just sits and soaks and lets the water run over his back.  So glad I bought this eight dollar pump!
Update: the day I wrote this I unplugged the pump to clean it and it wouldn't start back up.  Frustrated (thinking of my great review) I clacked a corner onto the surface of the bath and it re-started.  Have needed to re-start this way several times since but the pump is ultimately still running great.  Buying a second one for my parents!",1
"This bone is great for aggressive chewing dogs, but you need to monitor the dog,  if they take off a piece of plastic and eat it they may get an upset stomach/diarrehea",0

I've been using Extend for about a year and my 11yesr old dogs run around like they are puppies. Thank you.,1
fun time with bubbles!,1
"This is the largest vest you can purchase in this brand (Large) and even the packaging speaks to large breeds and up to 130 pounds.  My male Weimaraner is a hair over 92 pounds and I could not even get the chest Velcro strap to touch.  In disbelief, I even double checked the size tag within the vest and sure enough, it is labeled Large.  There is no way this can fit a dog near 100 pounds.  Nevermind 130 pounds.

Amazon's return process is very simple and I am getting it back to them.  I just wanted buyers with similar sized dogs, not to fall in the same trap.  Anything above 80-90 pounds?  Find the next product.",0
Rip off. Too small a packet of treats not worth the price.  Don't be a sucker and waste your money!,0
Keeps my dog in place while driving. Very good for long drives as well.,1
"I wish I had read the reviews before picking this up at the grocery store.  Within two days, my house is covered in litter dust.  I noticed the cats' eyes were mucky and that's when I saw one of them exiting the litter box with litter dust up to his knees.  Poor kitties, I can't imagine how much they have inhaled and eaten by cleaning themselves.  My nose feels muddy from just being in the same room as the litter box.  I'll be hitting the store first thing tomorrow to replace this trash.",0

Very happy with this product.,1
This is the worst leash I've ever purchased. The leash constantly gets stuck and won't retract. The button is poorly made and it gets stuck too. The plastic feels flimsy! Not worth buying this!,0
"THE GREAT THING ABOUT THESE FILTERS IS THAT THEY WORK IN ALL SIZE WHISPER MODELS. SO, YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY DIFFERENT SIZE FILTERS FOR THE LARGER AND SMALLER TANKS. SIMPLE DESIGN. ECONOMICAL INVESTMENT.",1

The price was better and everything looked pretty good.  NO! she had constant diarrhea and ended up having to goto her vet to get a steroid injection b/c she got so sick. They say USDA/FDA inspected, but there still originate from Brazil.
My little terrier has a different chew brand and is just fine.
Do not buy! Pay the extra dollars for a healthier pet - it will save you money in the long run vs vet bills!",0

the whistle came apart in pieces.,0
"It may be a bit heavy for small dogs, but I'm walking two on this leash using a coupler. The stretch in the middle takes some of the stress when one dog takes off, lessening the shock on the second dog's neck. The traffic handle near the bottom allows me to lift up, keeping them closer together when crossing streets or on busy NYC sidewalks. I wish they would use lighter hardware; I've never heard of any dog, no matter how big, breaking the clip on the end of the leash. I was using a Martingale training collar on one of the dogs (the one who was prone to take off) and the heavy clip was always pulling on the chain, even when the dog wasn't pulling. Despite that, i would still buy the leash again, and I recommend it highly, unless you were walking a single Yorkie or Chihuahua.",1
"The entire reason I found this bag was looking for biodegradable bags online - Google and search results yield these poop-bags.

I noticed right away in descriptions though it danced around being actually biodegradable.

Maybe they're ok poop-bags as far as poop-bags go, but being heavily marketed as earth friendly and biodegradable it's SO disappointing not only to realize they aren't at all, but also that no one seems to be picking up on it and calling them out on it.

Not ok. So sure using recycled materials is great but we as consumers need to have truly earth-friendly alternatives to all of these harmful plastics.",0
"It took longer then I expected for delivery, and the actual food is just powder instead of flakes. Very disappointed.",0
"I was really looking forward to this because I have an older dog who needs help getting up on the couch and bed. Unfortunately, the stairs had multiple defects in the wood and paint and I had to return it.",0
"I have a small dog and cat, but only the dog is allowed out.  We put the fob on the dog's collar, and we were able to train him to use the door in about 20 minutes.  He loves his new found freedom.

The cat was able to sneak out with the dog once, but we shortened the radius for the sensor, and he has not gotten out again.

This is a quality unit and was easy to install.  The only con is the door is a little noisy opening and closing.",1
The handle on this product is made for a child.  I am a small petite woman and in no way does it fit my hand.  Poorly designed.,0
"Arrived two days after ordered.  My fur kid loves them...easier on me, don't have to keep filling every other day....would recommend this vendor for future pet items...",1

"I've been battling a hot spot/granuloma on one of my labs using the ""cone of shame"" and/or bandaging - all have been inconvenient. But this sleeve is amazing! With the sleeve, he's left the spot alone, it doesn't get in the way like the cone and it's so easy to use! He's 80#, and while the large works, I think a medium might have been a better choice.",1
The description made it seem like the toy stayed in place and the tail wagged. It was just a vibrating ball inside. It was difficult to assemble and figure out how to work. The noise was really obnoxious and my dog lost interest quickly.,0
This is an excellent product. All of my dogs and now my cat are flea and tick free!,1
"So far so good.  Got this for my 8 week old puppy to take with me to my son's baseball games.  She is too little and not up on her shots yet to let her run around where other dogs have been.  She stayed in it great.  I also tried to use it in the car like the photo showed, that didn't go so well - she just wanted to try and climb out and explore.  The size is great also, and it feels comfortable on, just like a baby one.  I don't know what the little clip is for that it comes with.  Maybe to clip her collar in?  It didn't come with any directions so it's just a guess.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because I do wish that it had a pocket on the outside of it for my phone or for keys.  I may have to sew a mesh pocket in myself to really get to it's full potential.  I also wish the length were adjustable, so I could have the strap a little shorter since she is a smaller puppy, and I'd like to keep her a little closer to the nook of my arm.  Otherwise, it's a nice option for carrying your puppy around - and people just think it's so adorable! ;-)",1
"Totally worthless piece of junk.

If you turn the water pressure up to normal (not high) speed that you need to spray the dog - the attachment bulb actually starts blowing up like a balloon and flys off the faucet spraying water everywhere. So i then tried taping it on with duct tape. Turn the water back on and this time the hose blows from the bulb and flies off again spraying water everywhere. And i am NOT using too high a water pressure. Just enough to barely spray the dog. If you use more than a 3 inch drizzle (which is entirely worthless for its job) this thing literally explodes.

The spray nozzle on the end just is incompetently designed and it cannot spray out enough water in the holes so the water backs up and blows everything apart. I guess they didn't have running water to test this thing when they designed it in china.

The worst product i have bought in years. Amazon should not even be selling this piece of junk. I wish you could give zero stars.",0
I love the leash. The width is perfect for competition. My only concern is the smallness of the clasp. I'm hoping my big hands will be able to work the clasp quickly and smoothly when it's time for the leash to come off.,1
"So cute! My dog looks totally adorable in this. The hoodie is impractical, as are the pockets on the back, but they sure are cute!",1
Didn't work at all.  Amazon gave me a refund.,0
This Nylabone Go Active oddball is really nifty.  I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier.  I bought this for his 3rd birthday as an indoor/outdoor ball.  It definitely keeps him entertained and he tries to figure out where the ball will bounce too.  It's fun and he is really enjoying this oddball.  The Oddball itself is very bouncy and decent size and weight and quite sturdy.  He's had this for 2 weeks now and it seems to be holding up quite well and seems about indestructable.  It says it can also float but i've yet to test it out in the swimming pool.,1
way smaller than expected....didn't fit,0
I think this is my dogs fav sweater. Its very very cold this year and this is nice and thick and fits my dog perfectly! My dog is a chihuahua/terrior mix and on the small (chubby) side.,1

"Best cat box ever! I have a rather large cat and I never have problems with those little ""gems"" outside the box anymore.

"My dogs absolutely love this kong flyer. This is the second one i have bought the first one was at Petco where it was $17! And I learned the hard way when i threw the flyer into the wind at the park and that thing flew right into the middle of the pond and sunk like a stone, keep that in mind. This is the exact same product for much cheaper, i have a 3 year old 40lb english bulldog and a 78lb boxer who is only a year and a half old. The boxer Dexter loves to drag the bulldog Bella all across the yard but she can bite down hard with those jaws of hers and it doesnt puncture or tear at all. Very pliable but tough love it!",1

"Not much to say.  Quickly shipped by Amazon at a good price.  Works like a charm.  If you string too many of these, the gates can get flimsy, so order the right length to begin with.",1
Almost a month no any results !,0
My dog shredded this within a day.,0
It even comes with a security latch for the sliding glass door and weather-stripping.,1
When it arrived last week I was shocked to see the cuts and lack of stuffing the bed had.  I will be returning it.,0
"This toy functioned fine where my dog is concerned. I mean, how could it go wrong? It spilled treats out intermittently when she pushed it around.

I am the one who had problems with it. I found it very hard to adjust. You have to stick your thumb inside at an odd angle and move it about to get what you want clicked into place. I don't even have fat or large thumbs and found it hard and painful to do. I even managed to get my thumb stuck inside this stupid toy and had to literally cut it off my finger with a saw. That was the painful end to an expensive toy.

One last thing, you can't even open it up to clean the inside of it.

Waste of money. There are much better ones out there.",0
"Cannot be heard 3 ft from the bells.  A total waste of money.  The dog will go to them and swing them, but no sound.  If you shake them real hard you can get a soft tinkle sound.",0
too small,0
As soon as I opened the package the smell hit me. It was so strong & so bad my puppy didn't even want it. I immediately took it outside to the trash can. A waste of money. Maybe the other flavors aren't that bad. But the chicken was terrible.,0
This is not self cleaning you have to roll the whole thing to move the poop out so make sure you have room to do so.  Completely grossed me out !,0
"This product worked great for the first few months.  Cat loved it, wife loved it - happy life!  Product broke after 4 months.  One day just stopped working.  We would clean it once every two weeks and ensure that food / hair wasn't clogging pump.  Great idea, but cheaper quality construction.",0
"We have had these collars since 2014, and we use them regularly. However, somethings we have noticed is that, first of all, the collars are starting to not be able to hold their charge. I have had them several times, in the last few months, gone from fully charged to dead in a matter of two hours. We had company come over, but wasn't sure when they would arrive so we put the collar on the dog, made sure it was working, and then when people got here the collar no longer worked and needed charged.
Second thing is, the remote has no on/off switch, so you have to remove the battery between uses or the battery runs down quickly.
Lastly, because you have to remove the battery the connecters are crap. Therefor, as seen in the attached photo the remote is broken. We did are best to be gentle with it, but with cheap plastic holding the connectors....... what do you expect?",0
I was in high hopes for this item.  Unfortunately it didn't quite fit.  It is too small and will only fit over two of the corners.  I'm using cloths pins to hold down the other two corners.  I wish the makers of this product would make sure their items fit on what they are made for.,0
Item fell apart while walking our dog. Fortunately we caught him quickly when he got loose. The spring on the clip fell out leaving the leash useless. It was purchased just over a month ago so it is not returnable. We will be buying a different product for sure.,0
It is smaller than it looks but I would have been ok except the motor is very noisy and then it stops working in 3 months after I bought it.,0
"It is what it says on the tin. Decent quality flaked fish + chicken in aspic.

Fussie Cat was previously a popular brand in Hong Kong pet shops, comparable to Applaws and Royal Canin. It had become less easy to acquire there to the sadness of my cats. Very glad to see it available in the US market -- as are my kitties!",1
"This is what you'd expect from habitrail. It comes apart into many pieces and must be taped to stay safely together. The plastic feels like it will break if dropped, but I've had no problems with it breaking. It's larger than most habitrail lookouts, but still small. My mice seemed okay with the size, although they had a lot of trouble getting in through the porthole in the bottom. Poor placement of porthole- bedding falls through it and mice can't easily grip anything to climb up into it.",0

"I was a huge fan of the Jungle 5-in-1 test strips over the years, as I keep very sensitive cichlids in addition to freshwater fish that require vastly different water conditions.  Although Tetra's product looks almost identical to the Jungle product they bought out, it is greatly inferior.  They reduced the sizes of the colored squares on the comparison chart, and the colors are less vibrant, making it almost impossible for me to distinguish results accurately.  I can no longer tell the difference between hard and very hard water on their chart, and there are only subtle differences in color between a pH of 7.2 and 8.1.  The old Jungle kit was about 3-5 times more sensitive, allowing you to accurately assess pH differences of 0.2-0.4.  Thus, Tetra's changes to this product have rendered it useless in my house.  I may have to go back to using API and SeaChem's products, which are more expensive but very accurate and easy to read.",0

I have had these for months and 4 of the 5 or 6 that I originally received are still going strong.  Any casualties since arrival I would attribute to my own poor handling and care such as tank-mate selection or filters.  The young shrimp were packaged and shipped very professionally/quickly.  Do some Internet browsing and you will find reports of people having the same type shrimp living for years in their aquariums.  So if you want a hardy and interesting shrimp from a great seller then look no further. Recommend aquarium driftwood use and/drill more hiding holes for the shrimp to retreat and play in.,1

He tends to be very rough on stuffed toys (usually ripping off arms and legs and pulling out stuffing within a few hours) but this toy can really take a beating! The rope legs are really sturdy and the large squeaker in the belly is great fun (not too annoying as its difficult for him to squeak, but easy for me to squeak when I need to get his attention). I only wish it had a second squeaker in the head. Overall I would highly recommend this toy! (You can get it for 7.99 on a lot of dog toy websites so don't pay more than that!)",1
"I am highly disappointed in the ifetch interactive ball thrower. I was really excited to receive the product, as I thought my dog would love it. He loves to play fetch and really wishes you would throw the ball for him all day.  So, I thought this would be perfect for him, however, after taking it out of the box the machine worked for about 20 minutes then shutoff. Now it won't even turn on.  $150 for 20 minutes of play time, ouch! I had read reviews of this happening to others, but thought why not go for it, bad decision. Highly disappointed.",0
Work just as described. Very pleased with them,1
"We have three Dobermans and they each have one.  We love loading them with treats and the dogs can't get enough.  Very durable for our pups, who often eat other durable toys.",1
"It connects to the four headrests, but the seat cover is not actually long enough to full cover the full back seat, or prevent the dog from stepping on the back seat, making it ineffective at protecting the seats.",0
This sack keeps all of your old clothes/blankets in place within the dog duvet.  Our dogs really love their new bed!  High recommend this product.,1
cushion lasted a week then went flat washed it an it didn't help,0
We already knew the product is excellent.  But the price and service from this vendor was exceptional.  It was shipped immediately because we received it in 3 business days.  This was very unexpected especially since we ordered it during a holiday week and used the cheapest shipping option.  Good vendor - will use again!,1
Cats and kittens love this. I have bought several,1
Normally she stands stubborn and can pull herself out. This works! Finally!!!,1
"This fits my 8 lb. chihuahua perfectly.  It's soft yet sturdy, seems comfortable (she doesn't mind wearing it or try to get it off), and it's attractive. Good quality at a good price.",1
The container is different than the one I have always gotten . It came completely split in half needless to say they are stale and super hard. You lost a customer.,0
"We have used this for many years on three different cats. It is REALLY important to acclimate the kitty slowly over time, by first using the groomer without power, giving treats, etc. Our long hair kitty used to beg to be groomed if we missed a day. We attached it to a smaller handheld vac not an industrial vac. The two kitties we have now have been groomed daily with this since kittens and while they don't beg to be groomed, they are calm and tolerant. We have never seen either of them cough up a hairball.
This is a great product but its important not to rush the process of getting used to it. Common sense people!",1
"I just squirt a little line of shampoo down my dog's back, and that's all I need to cover my entire dog (minus her head/face) in suds. Depending on how dirty or thick-coated your dog is, it may be best to wash him/her twice, but one wash did the trick for my dogs, who are shorthaired. It lathers up very easily, which is a huge plus.

I found my double coated dog still had a slight ""wet dog"" smell after her bath (while her fur was still damp), but she smelled wonderful after she completely dried. (I just use the blow dryer to speed the process along. lol) It leaves my dogs' fur so soft. :)  My parents also use this on their large Lab/Boxer mix, and they love how it makes their dog smell.",1
My parrot finish the bag vey very quickly. its good food and vitamins for parrot.,1
Working a far on our little kitties! They were given to us with fleas and I had given them each a couple flea baths but after a few days they would have fleas again. I put this stuff on them 5 days ago and so far so good! :),1
This product works ok for about a week and then the clips get weak and break and the cover starts tearing i am very dissatisfied with this purchase.  Also it came in a greenish color when the picture shows a tan color.,0
Gave as a gift,1
It fits my Marineland 28 gallon perfectly! Great quality. I  looked everywhere and this was the ONLY place I could find it. It shipped super fast!,1
I own a pibull. It is difficult to find clothing that fits his broad chest. Zack and Zoey`s measurements are accurate. I do recommend following the washing instructions.,1
Perfect for my Rott who suffered pancreatitis.  She has not had a single bout since switching her to the low fat honest kitchen.  Both my dogs love it!,1
Great Quality.,1
"I had despaired of ever getting the pee stains and smell out of my carpet and sofa.  I drenched the couch and carpet spots then put some old t-shirts on them with some weight to soak it up.  I was shocked that it actually got the stains up and smell gone.  Worked on barf stains, too.",1
Arrived quickly and like the product,1
"He's not a chewer, and just loves this little guy!",1
Rats love it.,1
My dog doesn't like them.  I've tried to force them on him but won't do anything but spit out,0
"My two cats LOVE this bed! Years ago I got one for the first cat and she took to it right away. Last year we took in a homeless kitty, and at first he preferred the floor. Over the summer he decided the bed was his. I spent a lot of time and effort hunting for another one so both cats could be content! Both cats prefer the flat bed position as opposed to the optional hide-away position.

I think what makes this bed different & appealing (to the cats) is the shape when in the flat position. It is neither round or a wide oval like typical beds. It is more oblong, so cats can stretch out but still have the secure sides around them that most cats enjoy.

The only drawback to this bed is that it is not machine washable. Because of this, I always put liners in which I can easily toss in the wash. I use either a towel or a piece of fleece fabric.",1
"Great food so far nothing added extra, no grains or corn advertised. My dogs live the dried pieces if that's what the are.",1
These are the best. I now I have 5 of them all ver the house and my cats just loves laying in the window looking out.,1
I have a malshipoo puppy and she ate these things within an hour making a huge mess. Yes she loved them but I want to occupy my pup.,0
great sturdy construction.  very soft in hands.  braiding is well constructed.,1
"NEVER AGAIN!!  Not sure if our snow, ice, slush is different here in VA but this crap didn't work. Spent almost $100 & worthless. Called name on pail & complained but he couldn't understand, told me to take pictures & see about refund. Chalk up to experience.....money down the drain. Way too heavy for me try & return. This person will NEVER purchase again!",0
"Wow. My dog loves these and after seeing how much they have helped him, I do too. My pup is almost 9 years old and at 110 lbs, struggles some with his hips. I had him on these for a couple months. Ran out and started using something else, and the change in him was surprising. He had a struggle getting up in the morning and had stumbles when going up stairs. Immediately I ordered more and he is once again a happy dog.",1
These are sticks. Walk outside and pick up sticks.,0
"My dog is very playful but this toy didn't do anything. He looked at this ball rolling and then looked at me like, ""Ok, now, give me a real toy"". I tried for 2 days - no interest",0
"So far it's working great. A much better design than the LitterMaid it replaced. I also have the ScoopFree automatic litterbox, which also works pretty well unless you cat has diarrhea, in which case the ScoopFree can be a real mess.",1
"This thing is a major disappointment
Buy a Scat Mat you will be glad.",1
"My cat loves this,  it's pricey, but she LOVES it.",1
I've been looking for a dispenser for bird seed that was large enough to hold a good sized amount but also not too heavy to carry or awkward to pour.  These dispensers fit every expectation perfectly!!  They are solidly made and I completely would recommend!!,1
It is a good item for dogs who drink plenty of water.,1
"Excellent for training or for ""good dog"" treat. Small and crunchy.",1
"This is a weapon. If you toss it, make sure your dog is not in the area or you could hurt him. Even the small one that we ordered is too large for our 20 pound terrier mix. I like the idea of this toy, but in reality it is dangerous.",0
I've had this a little more than five months and it has stopped working.,0
"I've been wanting to install a kitty door for some time so when I ran across this I couldn't resist.  It was easy to install on a hollow core door, I just kept in mind the comments that the template was a little large.  The 3M strips worked fine for me. And my 18 lb cat has no trouble getting in and out (10 lb kitty is in the attached photo).",1
Frontline is a good flea protection product. I used it for years on my dogs and never had a flea problem,1
"I received notice that Dr. Livingston was promoting a new ""All-Natural/Organic""; Pet - deodorant.  Well, I too am a ""Chiropractor"", & truly appreciate all things ""Natural.""  I immediately  thought of my neighbor's hound ""Isabella.""  I mean her master has her sleep outside, the poor pooche 's breath is so bad.  And I adore animals and all, but this dog's breath was REALLY ""Ruff!""  So barring hesitation, I picked up the horn and called Dr. Livingston.  He sent to my neighbor's home a fairly small bottle of this, what I would gamble my professional license,  to say; ""This stuff really out-performs!""
~ And Isabella, ""pooch"", is more pert than I've ever personally known her to be.  *And I know ""Dogs.""

"I purchased this unit on December 6, 2011 and installed on December 12, 2012. Today, after noticing the pond water that has been staying muddy and green for about 2 weeks, I removed the unit's UV chamber and found that the UV lamp quits working and stays dark. Replacing with a new lamp, the lamp did not illuminate. Put in a new capacitor, it did not help to bring the unit back to life. It appears that the ballast is defective. It has only 9 months of use. I sent an email to the N. America Ani Mate, Inc. about the issue and now waiting for their reply and a resolution. The product has a 3-year warranty claim and, hopefully, I will get it repaired or replaced by the manufacturer.",0
"The tiny screws you have to take out to insert the batteries are ridiculous. It is too hard to open.  When I finally got it put back together, my cat wouldn't go near it.",0
"So we've had this system for one year. I own a border collie mix. Before purchasing this system we had experience with the petsafe wireless fencing (at the time had a beagle). It worked pretty well. The collar needed replacing and we wanted something with a few more features and longer range, so we purchased the Havahart system.
The good:
1) Comes with a couple of batteries, a charger (that can charge two at a time), a slim wall mount control, collar, and flags.
2) Long range on the control
3) Can program an extra collar.
4) Continuous alarm for when the dog is out of range.

The bad:
1) Control is difficult to understand how to program.
2) Charger only had one side that would work, so only one battery could be charged at a time.
3) Batteries didn't hold a charge over 3 days (and that was even with taking the collar off when inside).
4) Collar (1st one) failed after 7 months of use.
5) Second collar does not work after 5 months of use.
6) Collar is too large (at the smallest fit) for a 32lb. border collie.

I noticed with the second collar that the indicator light would fail to blink green when tightening the cover (to the collar). It appeared there was a problem with the contacts between the cap and collar or the spring didn't have enough pressure to create the contact. I took the collar apart and ""stretched"" the spring to create more pressure. This didn't seem to have an impact, but what did was the pressure applied to the cap. It's just a very poor design.

So I'm going back to PetSafe. My replacement collar came in the mail today and I'm anxious to see if the unit performs at keeping my eager to explore collie withing the range set.",0
"The cat, LOVES this tower.  I've had to add a couple screws to maintain the strength of the structure overall, possibly cause the cat needs to lose a few pounds, but overall it has help up great and the cat loves it. It'd his safe place from the puppy.",1
Two toys with strings are big hit. Our cat does not care for other toys.,1
"So I found this at my local target before heading to petsmart. I was going to buy a $10 bottle of cleanser but then I saw this bottle for less than half petsmart's product. I figured I'd give it a try and am glad I did. My 8lb cairn/silky terrier mix puppy was scratching on of her ears until they were quite red. I was worried it was an infection but then read that it could just be really dirty/waxy.

To get the bottle to squirt cleanser, you need to take a needle and just poke a hole or two into the nozzle. Don't take a pair of scissors to it, you might ruin the nozzle and then the cap won't fit. Poking a few tiny holes with a needle will allow the nozzle to release drops of cleanser into your dog's ear and/or into a cotton ball. The directions say apply generously, and after cross referencing with other ear cleansing instructions, I concluded that means put a couple drops into the ear canal. It's recommended that after a few drops, you massage the base of the ear to get that cleanser in there real good. Tutorials say you should hear a ""squishing"" noise while massaging if you put enough cleanser in the ear.

*tip* my dog gets real squirmy and didn't like the feel of the nozzle near her ear, so I squeezed the cleanser into maybe half of a cotton ball until it was soaked and then brought it to her ear and squeezed the ball to drip cleanser in her ear.

I cleaned her ears twice the day I bought the bottle then just once a day for 3 days after that. My puppy's ear is nice and pink again like her other ear now. I've been wiping brown residue out for the last couple of days so I know the cleanser is doing its job in dissolving the wax and dirt.

There's no fragrance added to the cleanser but it has a slight smell to it. Not very strong but it goes away once it's dry. But then that's why I only gave this product 4/5 stars, once it dries, it leaves a somewhat waxy residue on the surrounding hair. Since she's got silky long hair, it makes her ear hair look stringy hours after I clean her ear. It also left a waxy feeling on my fingers that wouldn't go away until I rinsed with water.

Besides the waxy residue, it's a good product for its price",1
"of GREAT QUALITY FOR VERY LITTLE $!!! Good product. received as described good quality, fast and easy shipping.
thank you",1
"Buy a piece of plastic pipe, thats all these are. My dog barely sniffed them and then ignored them entirely. Waste of money, nothing to attract a dog. They smell and feel like greasy plastic",0
"My two Maltese love these. They have to be limited on how much they get. Shipping was fast. They were well packed. I think they make great snacks as long as you don't over do it. If you have smaller dogs,like mine,you will probably want to cut these in smaller pieces. It just seems to work better for mine,because sometimes they try to eat them too fast,and choke. It hasn't happened only mildy. I recommend these.",1
My dog chewed it too fast,0
my turtle loves these! He is normally skidish but if he sees me opening the jar he comes right to the top!,1
"Product is good, but when I opened the box it came in, it had leaked.  The plastic container had a pinhole leak.  My garage smelled like the product for quite some time.",1
didn't last 2 minutes,0
"Okay, so while there were some bumps in the road with the set up and the mesh - I finally have it all sorted out and things are great! Does smell? Not really and compared to other litter boxes heck no! There is an obvious difference that I noticed after a few days. My cat does fling the litter everywhere so I use flushable and the box is setup in a spare bathroom in the tub. (The drain is closed). The transition to this box was easy enough as I placed it in the same spot as the other and used the same litter.

So far a great box. I'll update if anything changes.",1
Love the bright colors of these tags. Perfect size with info on them.,1
"Had I bought them for any other reason than to reach the $25 supersaver shipping requirement, I'd be pissed.  As it is, oh well.  My dog destroys tennis balls in minutes -- rips them along the seams.  These were no different. In the time that it took me to go in the house to get the sunblock, the ball was torn.  As for the smell, there was nothing whatsoever reminiscient of peanut butter. There was a very strong chemical smell, VERY strong, but not even a hint of peanut-y goodness. I didn't go so far as to chew on it, so I can't say that it didn't taste of peanut butter...but it seems highly unlikely. I agree with another reviewer that the Penn tennis balls seem to last a bit longer, and I can often find these at the dollar store, in packs of three.",0
"My cat doesn't care, he loves cardboard. Guess it depends on your cat. Plus this smells bad.",0
Easy to clean and inexpensive to buy. Would buy again if my other one stops working. My cats like it too.,1
"I love that you can use nectar, grape jelly and oranges in the same feeder.  Not many provide for all three, however the material used is prone to breakage.  I'm on my second feeder and had to repair it with a wire band and hot glue which probably won't last long.  They should make the bottom tray of metal which would add to the cost but increase life span by about 500%!",0
"unfortunalty,the box looks really dull and is slightly cracked in the bottom.my cat is 14 has no teeth, hyper active thyroid, and asthma. so i try to make him as comfortable as ican while im at work.  the pee seeps threw the bottom its cracked and the dome looks very dull not like the photo:(",0
Bought this to help with the cleaning of mine and my dad's old baseball gloves.  Worked great!,1
Quality product.  Very happy.,1
"My dog chewed and clawed her way out in less than an hour.  If you have a dog who won't try and escape, it's a nice crate with lots of room.",0
It's really cute and fits my 4 1/2 lb Chihuahua perfectly!  The fit and material is great. I wish it would come in pink too.,1
"Our 84 pound Golden has always enjoyed these treats. However, the vet charged more than $33 for a bag. How astonished I was to find that the price is half that. The product is spot on, the pricing seals the deal.",1
This works great and are actually lots quieter than I thought they'd be,1
I stepped on on it and it hurt and it hasn't apologized yet.,0
"Ok, I guess my car has a serious attitude problem because he sprayed right over this stuff. Bummer because I REALLYwanted this to work .",0
"This is my third Versa Top glass cover. Its good quality and perfect fit. Only issue is the price, the price is bit high.",1
HORRIBLE!!!  Don't waste your money!  My dog chewed through it in five minutes!!!!  He had it for 2 days and chewed through it in no time!  I only gave it one star because no stars isn't an option.,0
A good product,1
They were perfect for our Corgi's who have no neck to put a collar on!,1
excellent,1
Big enough for my small rat to use without hurting her back,1
"My seventeen-year-old cat has always been a moderate eater, but her taste buds seem to have dulled with age.  To perk up her appetite and help avoid an upset stomach,  I added some ""Adult Sensitive Stomach and Skin"" to her usual Science Diet ""11+ Age Defying""  about a week ago.  The result?  She liked the food on day one but began vomiting more frequently, and yesterday stopped eating entirely.  After reading other reviews, I realized there could be a connection and immediately went back to her previous food.",0
"It is perfect.  Just what I wanted for a skin sensitive dog.  I use it for his tags, not for control on leash.  He's 150# Newfoundland so usually easy going, but doesn't move unless he wants to, which requires some urging with prong collar.  Can't remember what size I ordered, but it is plenty big.",1
Great for a dwarf but too small for Syrians,0
ZIPPER BROKE AFTER USED ONLY 6 TIMES.,0
"I thought this fish oil would be a great supplement for my cats after one of them began to overgroom and created bald patches on her stomach and legs. All four of my cats refused any type of food with this fish oil added. I tried for many days in many ways. Finally switched back from a newer dry food I thought would be better for them, back to their old dry food, which obviously had more oils in the ingredients. Bald cat is getting her fur back.",0
"I have an average-sized rat terrier. If I go to a pet store and buy him a regular collar, he usually needs a size medium and occasionally a small. Based on the dog examples given by Halti/Holt as a sizing guide, I assumed that he would need a size 1. I reassured myself that it couldn't be too big since he's definitely not a miniature-type breed and doesn't fit into extra small or small sized regular collars generally. I was wrong. He can EASILY pull out of the Halti collar and it makes for a difficult walking experience. I have it adjusted to the smallest/tightest position, but he still manages to get right out of it. That being said, if I really watch him while we're walking, I can prevent him from pulling out of it if I give him a little upwards tug as he's pulling backwards. Sound like fun? Not so much. Neither the dog nor I enjoy the walking experience with the Halti. It does work a bit with keeping him from pulling forwards, so maybe I would be happier with it in a smaller size. However, I also ordered a size 3 Holt (same design as the Halti) head collar for my golden retriever. I can adjust it to fit around the back of her head, but she pulls much more with the Holt than with her Gentle Leader head collar. The GL collar looks like it is very uncomfortable because it cuts into her eye on one side, but maybe that's how it works so well (lol). I'm not sure I'd recommend that you try this collar unless you plan on buying it in a store after trying it on your dog and seeing how your dog responds to it. Maybe it's better than using a regular collar if you get the right size, but it definitely isn't a great product that's going to totally prevent your dog from pulling. So just don't expect that....",0
"I've only owned this product for a few days but our pup has responded to it immediately. We were having trouble with our 11 month old lab counter surfing and decided to cut her off from the kitchen completely. We were searching for a product to eliminate the use of baby gates which are ineffective against the weight of a 70 pound lab. With minimal (and I really mean no) training, our dog understood that the beep indicated a shock was coming and she was backing out of the kitchen. It has made our lives easier and we feel more comfortable letting her out of our sight as she can't get in as much trouble now! We were so satisfied we ordered another to designate a room just for our cat's food and other needs. Even with the temptation of cat food sitting out, our lab hasn't gone into the room. I will update this review as time goes in and the receiver goes through more wear and tear.",1
my dog loves them. seems to help her teeth,1
"With allergy problems of late, rabbit ttreats are the main things one can have.  The dogs love 'em.",1
"Bought it put it in tank, lasted less then hour. So noisy took it out. Will threw it out. I will go back to my aquaclear thank you. I tried two different sizes and the smaller one was noisier. I am trashing both.",0
Nice large bowl and easy to clean and judge the water level from a distance. Very happy with the purchase.,1
Awesome price and great delivery! Not going to the pet store even better.,1
"I've been using these wipes to clean my bulldogs tail pocket to prevent infection. They work great!  I gave 4 stars because I had a devil of a time getting them to pop up out of the dispenser in the beginning.  I ended up having to pull a bunch out and using them out of a plastic baggie, the first 1/4 or so.  Other than that, I love them and will continue to use them.",1
"A well built container that should hold up for a long time. Although, as I stated its not airtight unless I got a defective one.",0
"I have been feeding my cats organic raw chicken for several months and was thrilled to find this product with free shipping. My cats love the food. That's not the problem.

After trying the smaller sized packages and finding that my cats liked the food, I decided to try the 80-ounce bags because it was less expensive. However each of the 3 times I received the orders, the shipment arrived with some or all of the bags broken open, requiring me to re-package the food before freezing it. The second time this happened, all 5 bags were torn along the seam, so I called Naturaw directly and was told that maybe the bags broke because of the proximity to the dry ice. I requested that they send me additional bags in case it happens again with future orders, and they sent me 2. When I thawed the food I had to repackage, I noticed it had some freezer burn, and did not have the same color as the food in the original package. It didn't smell bad, so I didn't discard it.

Today I received a new shipment. This time three of the five bags were torn open. I called customer service again, and this time Jeff, who I had spoken to a few weeks ago, and apparently is the only person who handles customer service, essentially blew me off completely. All he would say is that he can give me Amazon's telephone number, which, incidentally, he never did. I repeatedly asked why Amazon would be responsible for the packaging problem, asking if Naturaw packaged the product or if Amazon did, and he completely ignored my question and refused to answer! I asked if I could speak to someone else, and he said he's the only person. I asked if he would send me more bags, and he refused. I told him I would no longer be ordering this product considering the poor customer service, and he couldn't care less, telling me that's my choice.

I have a raw food business (for people) and believe that raw whole foods provide the best nutrition, and have been recommending this product to my clients. I no longer will. I just found a comparable product from Nature's Logic in 3.2 oz. patties that I will order in the future. Unfortunately Amazon does not offer this product, so I will order through a distributor that does. Even without the free super saver shipping, the product is less expensive than this one.",0
"I will never buy this brand again.  I purchased three pairs and was unaware that there is no elastic at the back that goes from one hind leg to the other.  My 5 pound Yorkie ""walks"" out of these very easily.  I constantly have to keep putting his hind legs back in the pjs.  They are so  cute, but such a disappointment.",0

works great!,1
"Ordered for my mom who adopted a two month old kitten. Their shih-tzu was getting into the regular litter box. Her small kitten had no problem immediately using this box, and had no problem getting in or out, unlike the dog who gave up trying. It's in my Mom's master bath and she uses flushable litter, so it takes very little time and effort to clean it out every day.",1
"I ordered a returned item and I believe I know why it was sent back. The house is great though no flaps.
The heating pad barely works, temps range from 69 to 79 F using an instant read thermometer that has been very accurate so far.

Cat prefers an unheated pad on a cold rainy day because at least it has good insulation.",0

"The description says this house is perfect for ferals and waterproof.

I placed it under a very wide, metal overhang. The following day (day 2) it sprinkled, I would not even call it rain and the bottom of the house was soaked.  Water seeped in.",0

"The idea is cute, but this is too heavy for a dwarf hamster to move.",0
Love this collar! Easy to put on and take off my boxer/ pit mix. She is very strong and this has stayed strong. Will definitely buy another. Only downfall is that the nylon strap will wear out eventually from the prong . I would not hesitate to get another.,1
"We actually have several of the Flavorit bones and our Great Pyrenees puppy absolutely loves them so I wanted to get a few to give as gifts! The pictures I've included show the mini we recently purchased next to the extra large size mint we use for our 65lb.+ puppy and large versions of the chicken bone and peanut butter bone (and one of our Great Pyrenees with the mint).

The mint is probably my favorite because it smells so nice and leaves his breath vaguely mint scented after he's eaten all the peanut butter off. The chicken version has a scent vaguely reminiscent of chicken stock and he thoroughly enjoys that one! As far as the peanut butter version goes- well it's peanut butter and what dog doesn't love that? As someone who comes from a family with many food allergies I appreciate that it's allergen friendly so if you are a peanut free family- no worries!

He goes bananas when we put peanut butter in the little holes but we've also tried cream cheese and the spreadable mini cheese that comes in the red package and those work equally as well. He isn't an aggressive chewer despite his size but this entertains him for around 20 minutes or so which is great! I also really love that I can just put it in the dishwasher when he's done because dog toys can get so gross (and I wish everything were dishwasher safe like this!).

Overall I'd absolutely recommend these to anyone looking for a fun and tasty way to entertain their dog- plus it's super easy to clean and made in the USA.",1
"I  have two 11yr old cats, and wanted to give it to them just as a preventative measurement. One of my cats won't eat it though; the other one loves it.",1
"This gentle leader worked great for my 10-month-old doodle. He is constantly pulling, but the moment I put this on, we were able to walk alongside with ease. The only downfall, is that after only having it for about a month (not even wearing it everyday) it already tore, and no he did not chew on it as you can tell in the picture. I don't know if I got a faulty gentle leader with poor stitching, but I really wanted to love this product. I would purchase again, but I am fearful the same thing will happen?",0
"We had one for about 7 years and they hold up great, and we would take our dog everywhere and even when we got our second Cavalier King Charles they both used the same one, of course we have the large one.
We recently went cross country so we did not have to put the dogs in cargo and got are 2nd one. The dogs had plenty of room, slept or looked out the window the whole way. If you like to travel with your dog this is a great product that is safe and compfy for your dogs. Even comes with a strap to keep them even safer. They are amazing!",1
This is just a plain whistle.  Hate it!! I would love to give this product no stars,0
Wish it was a little easier to use.,1
Thick sliced whole white meat chicken. My two cats went crazy for them!,1
"These guys claim a lifetime warranty but you cant get a hold of them and they don't call you back Ive left them several messages.  As a test before you buy, call this number and youll see  what Im talking about 800-930-2604 Nobody will answer
Also, the product interface is terrible the buttons I just a pain in the ass.
Go elsewhere if you can.",0
"This product was so stinky, my cat hated it and i hated having the cat close by me. I had to wash my sheets when he came up to see me i nthe morning. I stopped using it. The company asked about my purchase, but when I told them my concerns (including the dangers of SLS - the ""safe natural"" ingredient of 2.7%), I went with a brand sold at Walmart for less than $5 that smelled better had had half of the SLS of Wondercide. I was dissatisfied, but they never offered me a refund.",0
Great for my older boxer getting into and out of my truck!,1
My Maltipoo loves this pet food. Tried to wean her off it but she refused . It is easy to feed and she is little so lasts 2 days so fairly economical. She also has dry food too.,1
"Dispite what others have said about this bulb. I love it.. It keeps the correct temps in my bearded dragons cage.. The only thing that may be a concearn is there is a switch in the light itself, ( you cant change it) and when it is turned off for even a spit sec you have to wait at least 10-15mins for it to turn on agian but that is a safety thing. Might not wanna buy this if you a lot of power outages!!! GOOD LUCK!",1
"Cats love it, does the job well.",1
"Thank you Kong for making a toy that my dog can chew on without destroying it. Great product, would definitely recommend this toy to dog owners.",1
.......one case I bought a while back was runny. I'm not sure why.  UPDATE - March 2018 - Just received 4 cases of Avoderm soup. It stinks & two of my three dogs won't eat it. I opened a few cans from each case. All of them were runny - After 9 faithful years - I'M DONE,0
I loved it until my puppy chewed at the bottom zipper until he ripped I out ... Not happy,0
"in just 3 day's Lady was feeling her old self, the product worked great!",1
waste of money. they are silly curly wires that get ignored and become a pain if you step on,0
Excellent quality. Proper sizing. Strongly made.,1
"you get two toys with the order. One of the toys worked for 5 minutes, then the motor would turn but no movement.
the second one is working. My cat plays with it for about 2 minutes. Then she just lays next to it looking at it.
They are very flimsy and not worth the money. I would get a refund but I don't want to deal with the hassle.
JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
My dog wouldn't walk with it on. She put her head down and easily got out of it. It is a very pretty pink and good quality. Easy to put on and secure buckle. My dog isn't used to a harness and didn't like it.,0
"One more product that I tried on my poor GSD that didn't work! I absolutely see no difference, shes still as itchy as ever. Also, while it smells nice when applied her fur starts smelling really strange (not in a good way) the very next day. I really hope that Ill be able to find something that works for her.",0
"I started to use Bark Stop Pro about a month ago as my dog was barking all the time when anyone or anything  car, cat, garbage car early in the morning etc - passed by and all my neighbors were complaining about that. It was really bad waking up three houses around at 5 a.m. in the morning with my dogs barking. But since I use Bark Stop Pro, my dog stopped barking and I had no more complaints from my neighbors. It really works and Im really happy I solved this problem!",1
"For this product I rated it with a five star because it came on time and was exactly what was advertised on Amazon. The product is a great product with a great price. The product was packaged very well for both security and protection in shipping.
Thank you.",1
"I have a small dog who is fairly easy on her toys. The squeakers punctured within a day, yet are advertised to squeak even after punctured...they did not. The fabric came apart very easily and the tears/rips leave fuzz everywhere. I was not at all impressed and would not buy this again.",0
The smell of this litter is nauseating.,0
"My Gus is a Black Lab/Mastiff mix. He is a destruction machine. To give you some idea, he can go through a bully stick in about 2 minutes (and I mean the 12 inch braided kind) and with a regular tennis ball, his record is 7 seconds to rip it apart! This has lasted about 6 weeks so far. He doesn't chew on it everyday, I would say about every other day but when he does go at it, he goes at it. It is all still fully intacted! There are a few needle size punctures but that is it. Nice job!",1
I've had this kennel 1 week and after leaving my in it for 2 hours today I came home to the kennel looking like this :( the door was so messed up that I actually had to fold down the back panel to get my dog out. This kennel was the right size and fit for my dog but obviously not built to hold up,0
"I am thankful for a powder form suppliment like this that is palatable enough that my cat will eat it right off the food and dish without having to be masked and disguised into the food. Having gone through renal failure with one of my old kitties recently, and with two others who are older and getting to that stage (over 16 year old boys!) I feel that this works great, given in the appropriate quantities, and as often as instructed.",1
I love this stuff! More importantly so do my fish!!,1
I have used the C.E.Ts for quite sometime and my little pom loves them.  She just has to have one daily.  highly recommend these chews.  The petite size is just right for her.,1
"My cats are not petite and this product holds zero interest for them. The hammock, which I thought would be the main draw, is simply too small. My older cat, who's admittedly large for a cat, refuses to stay in it and you can see him panicking that he's going to fall out anytime I put him in it. My younger cat, who's normal sized, has similar issues and refuses to use it. It could be due to construction - I noticed the one I received the cloth triangle above the opening in the 'tent' doesn't stretch very far - so my hammock droops far more than the picture (due to both sides forming a narrow V shape) and makes a far smaller resting place. There is no way to fix this without trying an exchange and hoping it's a defect in mine or cutting the fabric and damaging it. It's possible over time usage would loosen this cloth but since they won't use it because of this issue - it's doubtful.

Finally, while my older cat did use the tent a time or two the scratching post and swatting balls aren't used either. The balls are just not in a good place design wise I think. And I've yet to see a cat who uses this type of sisal scratching surface on any product but especially this one.

I would not recommend this at all unless your cat is very petite, as I said in the title, and even then I would only recommend it lukewarmly. I will likely just return mine.",0
"Very disappointed. My 20 pound beagle mix completely destroyed this in less than 10 minutes. I realize it is a rope toy, I know he will chew on it, thats why I got it, but ten minutes? Thats ridiculous.",0
Tiny staples up and down the post pose a hazard to cat claw's returning the item to seller.,0
"I passed this one on to my dog-lovin' friend, who assures me that it is a great product for big, gnawing puppies. Hence the 4 stars.

However, I actually bought it in a fit of optimism because I am constantly looking for food-dispensing toys for my rambunctious and perpetually ravenous cats, and frankly, there's not much out there. Sadly, though, this toy is about 3 times to big for any sort of cat you'd ever want to keep in your house--up to and including cheetahs.  Not the manufacturer's fault--I was just hoping against hope.

To dog owners: it's tough and bendy and will probably serve you & your pooch well.

To cat owners: alas, the search continues...

To the manufacturers: have you considered making the same thing on a much smaller scale for cats?",1
Switched my dog to raw diet...this gives me peace of mind that he is getting all his nutrients!  He loves it too!,1
"Perfect for what we needed it for(keeping little elderly dogs out from under foot in the kitchen)!! Great value, but not for people who have dogs that will constantly push against the gate or puppies who chew.",1
Its wayyyyy too small,0
Dogs love it.,1
They get the job done.  We like that they tear easier at the perforations and the scent is nice but they are a little thinner than the ones from A*****,1
"for $18.00 it is ok but if I would have paid the original price I would have been pissed!  Our dogs like to scratch before settleing down to speep like most dogs do the small Yorkie had a hole in the white side in a few minuted from scratching and turning in circles, first time my schnauzer got on it I fliped it over to he red side so he didn't do the same. the fabric is very thin it wouldn't be worth the $40.00 something dollars they want for the original price.",0
"Lasted 10 minutes with my Shiba Inu.

Easily chewable and not worth it! Thanks Kong...",0
Awesome tool!  Highly recommended!,1
my picky cats love it. nuff said!,1
Works great.  The only problem is my cats can't see through the flap--wish it was clear.,1
"DESPITE MARKINGS:
NOT A MEDIUM... Too TIGHT for a Teacup Yorkshire Terrier - DONATED",0
Horrible. I have purchased puppia collars in the past according to the measurements provided. This one was like a reject/ knock off. Had no time to send  it back and had to sew it myself. Ridiculous. :(,0
"My dogs love this toy! They go crazy trying to get the ball out. Unfortunately, my bassest hound/lab can destroy this toy in an hour.",0
Leather quality is excellent but stitching came undone. Customer service from Fairwin was superb. They let me exchange this for the braided one.,1
The chain is exactly as described on Amazon and does appear to be chrome plated.  The quality is fine and at about half the cost of a non-chromed product at the local big box pet store.  Cannot do better than that!,1
"The odor is overpowering. I could hardly breathe after getting about a half of my large Dobie covered. I would go get a lung full of fresh air, then hold my breath and go back to spraying but could not get him completely covered. He hated it as well and when I finally let him go he ran all over the yard shaking his bod and giving me dirty looks. I looked for any evidence of dead insects of any kind. I found nothing. I have washed my hands at least a half dozen times but cannot rid them of this very unpleasant odor.

Best thing that happened for my Dobie and for me is my pouring the rest of this horrible substance out, rinsing the bottle and throwing it into the recycle bin. Good riddance to bad rubbish, as the saying goes.",0
Thanks,1
"My dog loves this and it is strong.  He loves to chew enough to tear up any toy I get him then swallows them.  This is organic, no dyes.  I'm happy with it and it's lasting a long time.",1
"we found it impossible to install this net with 8-10 bungee cords.  Perhaps it is our car specifically, but i doubt it.  instructions were weak, and even we had managed to find places to secure it, it would have looked like hell.",0
Very nice and professional looking stickers.  Very convenient to have them printed out already.,1
"Gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it.  ""My cat hasn't jumped that high in years!""",1
Very good product!!!,1
Love it very comfortable and safe for our dog.,1
"Ice cubes stick to the tray, and break apart as you try to remove them.  Would not recommend this product (and normally I love Fred products).",0
It worked for a while once we trained the cat to use it but it's a fragile concept.  Once the cat got diarrhea it was a huge gloppy mess.  We had to through the pellets away.  We switched to normal little and never went back.,0
"I believe the title says it all.  The original box was obviously damaged and taped with packaging as if a third grader had done the job.  Upon receiving it and seeing it's appearance I then counted the number of bones which ended up being eight short....about 15% off.  I then contacted the vendor and amazon and never received a reply back.  Therefore I am very disappointed with both the condition of the product, the vendor, and amazon.",0
"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats.",1
"Cover comes undone often, leaving a trail  of unrolled bags behind. Other than this manufacturing issue, it's an OK dispenser. Manufacturer needs to redesign.",0
Just what i wanted.  This is my dog's favorite toy.,1
15 minutes after getting this dog was over it - other dog hasn't even picked it up. I don't understand the hype from other reviews.,0
"I have been trying out different brands of cat litter for a while. Super Scoop was my most recent, and least favorite. The litter did NOT CLUMP for urine, so every time I scooped, the urine soaked litter fell through and remained in the box. After about a week and a half of this, the ammonia odor was overwhelming and drifted throughout the entire first story of our house. I had to completely empty & wash the litter box as well as throw away the half unused box of litter because I was not about to torture my family's olfactory glands by giving this litter a second chance.",0
"Pretty good. Fish seems to like them. A little hard to measure out, but otherwise okay.",1
My 2 chihuahuas were completely happy riding in this well made booster seat.  They were able to enjoy looking out the window safely and without trying to ride in my lap.  Highly recommend!,1
"The locking mechanism is not engineered right, I am not the only one complaining about this. Guess I just have to get another make, this one is now in the trash.",0
"I put this on my 9 month old shepherd/retriever mix as I wanted to eliminate him choking himself on walks since he is so excited all the time. I put it on him went upstairs and came down and he shimmied his way enough that he chewed right through it, literally, in 2 minutes. He did think he was very clever for getting it off and pranced around with it in his mouth victoriously for awhile. I just think with todays technology companies (especially dog) should be able to come up with some stuff that isn't so weak. I was really excited to try this.",0
"These are great,the cats go crazy for them.",1
"terribly disappointed in this ...the selection of items was nice bit the sharpness of the scissors was horrible. Gave the curved and the straight shear a try and quit...I have light weight fur on bichons and wouldn't us e them even on them.mbad purchase, returned",0
"Cute, but arrived broken. Very bad packaging.",0
Had our cats picture on a table during our wedding. What a handsome boy!!! Worth it. Everyone got a kick out of it.,1
"Not as described, wood not metal.",0
"This arrived in two pieces which is probably a packaging problem more than anything.  We sealed the edges with aquarium-safe silicone and put them in the tank.  It doesn't glow near as much as we'd hoped, even under the LED glow light.",0
"This product no longer works on my cats.  And, the first shipment arrived completely destroyed: the contents of each vial was dehydrated and/or emptied.",0
"my cockatiel loves them, all varities",1
"We have had 3 ferrets and they love these kongs.  We also have a knobbly kong toy that is about the same size, but I didn't see it on Amazon.  They love to bite and play with these toys.  Such a great toy for them.",1
This product is so great! I adopted a rabbit from a local organization about a year and a half ago and at first he wouldn't eat any hay I gave him! I tried all different kinds from pet stores but he wouldn't eat any of it. I was worried so I went online and read the reviews for Timothy second cutting and I bought that from small pet select and he actually ate it!! He didn't eat it all the time but enough so I wasn't to worried. BUT when I got an email for orchard hay from Small pet selects I thought it can't hurt to try it... I've tried all the others. And my bunny loves it!! He eats it every day and sometimes I have to refill it twice a day! I'm so happy I found this product... It's great and not short little pieces of hay like some of the products at pet stores. Also I find that they offer good deals for shipping and sometimes even free shipping which makes it very reasonable. I highly suggest this product!,1
They were so small. I got the level 2 and they wouldn't even fit a Yorkie! They need to put suggested breeds on the size levels instead of us just guessing,0
What was purchased for the cat as a cute scratching post. Now it just a cute eyesore. He doesnt  even care to go near it. never scratched on it. just collecting dust.,0
"Great item, If you have several or just one Big Dog. Holds plenty of water and keeps it fresh. Recommend getting the mat also, keeps fountain in place on tile and water off the floor if you have a sloppy dog.",1
"This is a cruel joke for cats owners. 1. the pellets are too big for poop scoops, so you can't get the poop out without ""playing"" in the crap!  2. pellets are too big to smother the stink from poop, when your cat goes #2, YOU'LL KNOW! 3. older cat wouldn't use it. I bought this stuff at walmart last night, I come home to a house that smells like it's been painted with manure! I tryed to get the ONE pile of poop out and just smeared it all over the end of the scooper. on my way to the store for my ARM AND HAMMER SCOOPABLE right now.",0
"poorly made. wood split, no ventilation in warm weather too small",0
"The product itself is great. Light weight and comfy for a dog to wear HOWEVER no 5 star rating as the size description is WAY off base.
My first order was too large and it was my fault, I evidently inadvertently checked the wrong size, although I didn't think I would order an XL for a Jack Russell. I made an exchange but lost money on the return so the reorder was the same price, plus the shipping I had to pay to return the large one. This time, I made sure I remeasured and got the Medium. It doesn't really go around his middle at all, I can JUST about click it closed with great care but it is not going to be good/safe enough for him to wear like that.
So If I return again, then I will have lost more money on this purchase, so now up to $14 over and above a new purchase of $24.99, and add on shipping for this one to arrive which was admittedly dropped for me last time,  IF the new one fits. I do not trust the sizing to take the chance again. Very sad as this is a nice vest and makes training my dog more understandable to all who have to come in contact with us.",1
"We have 2 three year old cats who are no strangers to dental care. Decided to try this stuff. I purchased the salmon flavor. Upon opening, it smells strongly of mint. They both scrunch their noses and run away. Okay, time to herd cats and give them doses anyway. They both gag, and become lethurgic after they finish licking every offending spot. Not pleased with this product.",0
Seems very cheap...not worthy of being mounted into the wall or woodwork,0
Heraclitus my big boy hamster loves these.,1
"I am not sure what to do here. I bought for my cat who is about 9 lbs. It said ti worked up to 10. Well, within about 15 minutes of the first time using it, she ripped the screen part in the side that is showing here. It is anything from heavy duty. It is way too flimsy for most pets",0
"this cartridges last up to 6 month, I have to cats and I run my cat genie twice a day. I am saving more money than buying it one or three at the time.",1
Didn't work very well,0
"We bought 2 of these collars for our 2 dogs (pugs).  We initially ordered both on the same purchase, and one was slightly too small, so we sent it back.  I sent it back on a Saturday, and received the new size on the following Thursday (great service).  I only give them a 4 of 5 because the stitching seems like it could be a little more tight or secure feeling - which is only a concern as sometimes our dogs pull - and I worry that they may tug a bit too much on them.",1
"VERY DISAPPOINTED. I ordered a Medium (Price: $10) based on measurements given, and even added a couple inches to leave room. WAY too small. I need a Large, which is priced at $22, more than TWICE what a Medium costs.",0
"This is going back! Cheap quality. Drawer did not line up properly, directions were terrible and it is no where near big enough for a bunny! Disappointed given the great reviews so far.",0
i cancelled the order,0
Too big for my little dogs.  They didn't seem interested in them,0
Awesome product! Great quality and a wonderful value. Thank you.,1
This is the best product on the market we loved it verry good treat and it helps arthritis wow it's great,1
Ripped beyond repair within one week of putting it on the horse.  Definitely not up to turnout.,0
"Unfortunately, my cat became very sick from this product.  She was vomiting and had diarrhea.  My vet and I followed the directions and gave her the correct amount.  Perhaps she might be able to take a very small amount, say 1/8 teaspoon, instead of 1/4 teaspoon, as prescribed on the jar.???.  I may try it again in the future, once she is completely off her antibiotics.",0
"Our pup is a sloppy water drinker...she has a very whiskery face! This tray contains the worst of the dribbles helping to protect our hardwood floors. It is easy to pick up and wash and dry. Nothing fancy, but practical and useful. I have considered getting a second one for shoes by the front door.",1
"When I got one large enough to work, my lab got it off all the time. Exchanged it for a large and he can reach everything, chewing, licking and slurping. Back to the cone, I guess.",0
If I don't add their Nupro to their all meat dinner they'll walk away. It's amazing how even my pickiest Frenchie will eat up all her food.,1
"Definitely not rugged if you have a chewer. My husky/hound puppy (6mos) had this destroyed in less than a day. She had 3 of her favorite bones to chew on, and she chose the bed instead. Waste of $20.00.",0
"cat loved this, it does need constant refilling, and regular cleaning is a must, but the cat loves the running water effect",1
It broke into pieces after the first chew.  Dangerous if swallowed,0
"For the price I thought it was a great deal, however when they arrived one of the bulbs was shattered. Figured it came with 3 more so not a big deal. Had 1 of the bulbs in my lizards housing for 4 days and it literally exploded, at the moment I am testing the other bulbs hoping it was just a freak accident but probably will not order again.",0
"We adopted an 18lb (!!) cat from a local shelter. This cat had spent six years in one room with 50 cats. He was the boss of the food, so he ate all he wanted, and he wanted lots. He needed to lose weight in a controlled manner. We also wanted him to come inside at dawn and dusk when the danger of coyotes is the strongest. This feeder was the perfect solution.
The feeder drops the food into a hollow plastic bowl, much like a Vegas slot machine. Lots of noise like the old time slots would do with coins. The cat was enraptured with this feeder. He knew the exact times it would go off, and he was there waiting.
He immediately learned to put his paw up inside to get more, but that food was part of his next meal.
He got down to 8.5 lbs and was a healthy cat size.
If we left for a weekend (more than that and we boarded him), the feeder kept him inside, fed and sleepy.
When the battery is low a red light flashes. To replace the batteries you will lose the correct time of day which is easy to reset. You don't lose the feeding times and amounts. It's a great machine. Three years and counting. Still working. I hope I don't jinx it by bragging on it.
Amazon has a good price, too.",1
"It is a good product, great quality, I would recommend this product. I didn't get the correct size for my dog it is too big for him. I got the size M and my dog is a shihtzu 5 pounds. I just have to wait he grows so he can use it.",1
"To early to tell if it works, but I pride myself on shopping prices and I must have had a bad day..LOL  This is way overpriced.  You can buy for the same price for 4x the amount elsewhere.",0
These chew sticks have made both of my dogs vomit. I throw them in the garbage. Can not find on the package where these things are made. My guess would be China. I would not buy these things again and would not recommend them to others.,0
Was super excited to receive this bed. Somehow I received incorrect parts for the mesh part. Super bummed!!!,0
Used this to teach our little min pin to pee out doors instead of in the house LOL LOL She goes out now and when she pees she comes in and does three sixties to get her treat  Bag lasts alnost a month,1
To small for my skinney 9 lb Yorkies hole for the head is so small. It's cute though order a bigger size maybe and material won't really stretch and this lafitness is in refundable,0
Dogs continue to pee in same spots even after cleaning with this product. I thought the product was supposed to keep that from happening. Product smells good and cleans wells.,1
"I use these to hyper mod my 2215, With this impeller attached I get about 160GPH actual per filter on a clean filter, using the installation set add-ons (they have better flow than included spray bar and intake.",1
Didn't like. Only used twice...very flimsy.  Would not recommend.,0
"My puppy has been carrying this thing around for the past week, he simply loves it. I would highly recommend it",1
The fish love it.,1
"I bought this cage for my Syrian hamster. It's ideal size,  but after only a few days the ramps are popping off from the first to second shelf. Haven't followed up with the seller, but it could be a safety hazard.",1
Perfect!,1
These things are humongous. My dog loves them. Good value for the price.,1
one sank to bottom. Waste of $ for us...only ordered to appease children who had lost their fish. Never again,0
chickens love it,1
"It was apart within 5 minutes.  The good news, it was full of white Polyester Fibres.  So if you enjoy paying $5,000 in vets bills for surgery to remove this nondigestable plastic from your dog's stomach, this is the one.  As soon as I saw the Polyester, less than 5 minutes, the toy went into the trash.  I am so glad Amazon has these dog killer toys.",0
This is our second Sherpa carrier. It's wonderful and my cat loves it too!,1
My best friend loves these and it's the only way he will take his medications.  He figured out that I was hidding his pills in cheese and now he won't touch cheese so this product is a life saver.,1
Fit good and nicely made,1
"Dogs don't really love them.  They'll eat them, but I can tell it's not their favorite.  Plus, they're hard to break in half without them crumbling in your hand or coming out more like 3/4 to 1/4 rather than half and half.  That's a problem because they're a bit too big for my smaller dog.",0
"Our cats both love this food and it's a lot cheaper than what I was paying for the ""prescription"" food my vet was charging me an arm and a leg for.  I bought it specifically because of the fact that it's natural and is actually healthy for my cats.",1
I returned this because it was top heavy for a 9 lb dog. Trying to get it out of the package was the most difficult....careful! Looks very intimidating and I don't think this would have served it's purpose.....may work for a large dog I suppose.,0
"This is the second type of slow feeder that I've had for my dogs, who seem to just inhale their food.  This definitely slows them down much more than the last one.  Other reviews say that their dogs had to get used to the bowl.  This was not problem with mine, although I doubt anything would keep them away from anything they even think is edible.  I took off one star because the rubber does not go all the way around the bottom.  This seems to make it easier for this bowl to slide around.",1
Pretty bright light.  Awesome dimming effect mimics natural light conditions.,1
So far have seen no improvement,0
"I'm sorry I cannot recommend this product - it's cute, my dog loved playing with it and tearing it apart.

I have safety concerns for the pet. My yellow lab was able to tear through the cloth part in about 30 minutes - that leaves a plastic water bottle exposed, which when torn apart can cause gums to get cut. Of greater concern, the squeak toy that is part of the plastic  water bottle lid is made of a harder plastic, which took my pup about 5 minutes to chew apart, leaving the squeaker exposed. This presents a potential choking hazard.

Having already spent 500.00 on a pet ER visit, I watched my dog closely when she played with this. Had I not known, it could have been a problem. Color me paranoid, but as cute and fun as this toy was, I would not recommend leaving your dog alone with this.",0
The battery died very quickly.  We don't use it often and I maybe lasted 45 total.,0
A good item to keep water clean.  Frustrated not to be available at discount in quantity.,1
"I tried these tunnels out on 5 different cats. All were very interested in them, but refused to go inside. The tunnels stayed in my liviving area for one week. I packaged them up and will take them to the animal shelter. I think kittens would love them. I decided that the diameter of the tunnel was a bit small, making my larger cats suspicious.",0
Dogs seem to enjoy this on their dry food.  Their shedding has diminished somewhat since this has been added to their diet,1
"I really like PUREayre; however, the spray nozzle stops working after awhile, necessitating purchase of another sprayer top.  Since I don't have another top, I'm using the remaining product by pouring it out manually. The container needs improvement.",1
worth the money,1
"I like the product. However, I ordered 2 collars, not just one.

So, I don't know what to do..., My ordering history shows I ordered two, got one.  It's essentially my word against the provider. And, I still need a collar. Any suggestions?",0
Chest piece is not adjustable - had to cut it to get it off my puppy's head when she outgrew it.,0
"Very sharp, easy to handle.  Excellent price.",1
Works well for our foster dogs in our rescue program! We keep this in stock all the time!,1
My dog chewed right through this. Little orange pieces everywhere.,0
"I feed RC everyday, my cats have never been healthier",1
"Followed directions, was completely submerged, less than 12 inches pumping elevation, and unit was not clogged, (new).
Worked great for that first gallon of water. Then it stopped, got EXTREMELY HOT, and created a burnt plastic smell in my house.. Created a great deal of work for me. I thought this would at least empty a 10 gallon bin of just water. CHEAP/GARBAGE unit. Returned for full refund.",0
"Purchased this fountain because my cat refused to drink water from a regular bowl and insisted on getting water from the bathroom sink. This fountain served our needs and she's drinking water again. The fountain is easy to put together.

My only complaint is a purplish mold starts to develop and spread every few days. It gets everywhere, including on the pump and the filter. We have to thoroughly clean/sanitize it several times a week. We are using filtered water.",0
Seems to work well,1
"Unfortunately it did NOT work on my little girl.  All she did was cry and  cry when I put it on her.  It was worth a try but I couldn't  recommend it to anybody.  Believe me, I was praying and hoping it would work.
Sorry!!!!",0
"The size chart on this thing is GARBAGE...
The supposedly XLarge which is said to sport 30cm or 12inches from neck to stout is 1/3rd the actual claim.

Who took these measurements?",0
"Our dog is a very picky eater and she loves these Chews.  They were recommended by our vet but she wanted much more for them.  So, as usual, we checked amazon and found them consideraby cheaper with free shipping.  We've learned that whenever we need anything, we always check prices at Amazon first.",1
"My golden lab, Charlie, LOVES this bed! We take it camping and traveling all the time. It's easy to pack, lightweight to carry, and has plenty of padding to sleep on. The material has never torn (we've had it for 1.5 years now), and its easy to clean. I highly recommend this bed - and so does Charlie.",1
Love it! It will come in handy for indoor and outdoor activities!,1
"We loved this collar at first, until the puppy grew.  She is a 6-month old puppy so she's growing like a weed, and this is her 4th collar so far.  It is not a 14-20"" collar as advertised, as Lil's neck measures 15"" around and we had to cut the collar off of her since it doesn't have a clasp.  It would not slide over her head, and we had it adjusted all the way out so I know it doesn't expand to 20"".  This is by far the best style of collar, especially while training, but keep in mind that they do run smaller than advertised.",1
"This is NOT SAFE!!!! DO NOT BUT THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO POISON YOUR CAT.  I'm so angry,  disappointed and upset that this is allowed to be sold. I fell victim to reviews raving about how well this stuff works.  My 4 cats have fleas,  not infested,  but some. I received this product today and applied it to the 4 of them. Within 10 minutes, 3 of them were acting funny,  lethargic and just off. The 4th one went crazy running around and foaming at the mouth! We quickly washed the poison off them! I call it poison,  it shouldn't be called medicine!!!",0
"Don't buy this. It doesn't work. Save your money.
The story:
I am the loving owner of an 8 year old black labrador who has been with me since he was 8 weeks old.
The house we have lived in for the last 7 years has a basement with a door that leads to the back yard. Conveniently, the previous tenants were dog owners (as is the landlord, who lived here before that) so there was already a dog door installed in the basement door to the yard and consequently my dog has been free to come and go as he pleases.
Cut to last week when my girlfriend moved in along with her 3 year old cat who has been an indoor cat all her life, having lived in a fifth story apartment up until this point.
We looked at various options as to how to stop the cat going through the dog door.
Our efforts were brought into sharp focus after a frantic search when she got out (to then be found three hours later back in the house, hanging out under the bed).
We decided to try this product to stop her from going into the basement.
I read the instructions and set the receiver up so that it went off when the transmitter on the collar got about a foot from the door leading to the basement. I simulated ""cat height"" and even covered it with my hand to see if the cat's fur or head would somehow mask the signal. It didn't - It went off every time I got close. The cat seemed not at all phased by wearing the transmitter collar. So far so good!
In putting the unit to the test in the real world, the mechanics and electronics all functioned fine. The problem lay in the fact that, even though she's very skittish and shy, the alarm did absolutely nothing to deter her from walking straight past the device and getting lost again.
We got her back and I have now finagled another way of stopping the cat getting into the basement.
Basically, the one thing this product is meant to do, it clearly does not!
Utter garbage!",0
"Our basset / dachshund is not big on exercise, but more so LaZboy lounging. I gave all 3 balls to him last night and he had a blast! I don't think I have ever heard him pant from exhaustion until last night. He is 8+ years old. We completely enjoyed his happiness!",1
This item came very quick. But I do have a complain- its an aquarium thermometer but its not water or splash proof! It fell into my tank the day I got it and stopped working. I was hoping to return it and get a new one but they don't offer returns so now I have a broken thermometer :(,0
Garbage. Lights don't work and air hose was way too short,0
"This product makes my life easier. Without this containment system, my dog would dig out of the backyard. Works for me.",1
The product works well and company that makes it stands behind their product.,1
my dog would not eat it.  i took it to the shelter.,0
My cats love to play in this and hide in it and is well made and doesn't collapse easily like other models I've purchased.,1
The water doesn't always come out  when you step on it. Not happy with this product,0
Works like it's supposed to,1
Cute! They are pretty sturdy collars. A great fit for my nearly year old house cat. The bell is soft but noticeable. With my cats medium coat the reflective material is hard to see on him but I think it is a great feature for shorter hair. I hope he never gets outside but I wanted a collar on him just in case. He is currently wearing the orange one and it still looks great after weeks of wear.,1
"Dog loves them!  They are pretty stinky, but nobody expects a pizzle to smell great.",1
"I bought this product from our vet as recommended by him. Not only did the product not help our dogs ears, but he shook his head continuously (guessing it hurt him, he seemed very uncomfortable). Don't buy this!",0
It has worked well. Love the poop bag attachment.,1
"Runs really, really small in size!",0
I purchased All Absorbent training pads from Amazon a few months ago 19.99 for 100ct they worked pretty good. I saw these for a few bucks cheaper and after reading the positive reviews ordered them. Well they are not very good. I have a 6 pound female Chihuahua and whenever I pick the pad up it is wet underneath. I change these just about every time she goes pee. So it is not like it's sitting there and being used over and over again.,0
We slowly switched from the kitten version (she's about 8 months) and her poop stinks less!!! Wish we had switched sooner...,1
Useless for my dog,0
My cat has a few choices on where to sleep and this seems to be the favorite lair for loafing around and sleeping,1
Not as nice as I thought they would be,0
"Bought this for my 50 gallon tank (30 gallons of water) with red eared sliders. We installed the filter before cleaning the tank, hoping it would at least eliminate some of the smell until the weekend when we could clean it. (Cleaning once a week wasn't even enough to control the smell, turtles really know how to dirty up a tank.) Without cleaning it the water is now clearer than its been and the smell is completely gone.
The only thing I could add to this is that the instructions are basically useless, however there  are plenty of videos online to help with set up.",1
My dog won't eat. He smell then walk away!,0
what can you say about cat litter.  it serves the purpose.,1
"This is one of those veterinarian recommended products you never really know if it works or not, but it certainly passes the 'Woof' standard of excellence. The Chondro-Flex Joint Chews we use are beef, very soft, and our 95 lb senior dog loves them.",1
"A bit heavy, but well made and our dog is large.",1
tuff tug o war,1
"Got this for my little 12 pound dog for Christmas, she loved it at first but after playing with it for five minutes one of the legs fell off.
After tearing the leg off, she started tearing off the little purple bits around the house, demolishing the toy while making a big mess on the rug. I'm not sure what they used for their ""Chew Guard Technology"", but it evidently didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",0
"Bought this for my grandkitties who are Maine Coons. Their  average weight is about 15-18 lbs. this is sturdy and quite durable. I have one for my Kitties for over 20years. It has transported many pets past and present. In my experience, you can't go wrong.",1
"A very high tech heater for the fishes.  After setting the temp the display wiil show Blue (too cold) until it gets close to the set temp then changes to Green.  If it gets too hot it will change to Red. Also flashes and alerts if there is insufficient water flow around the heater..... I really like that there is a covering all around it so, heaven forbid, it breaks there isn't glass everywhere.",1
Doesn't catch all the clumps. Not much room for the cat- a lot of space is taken away due to self cleaning area.,0
Not the correct size xxl my fat butt as if lol,0
Phoenix Ridgewood shilohs Shepherd puppy has recommended by the breeder although she said the only seen him one bag and then switch to something with little protein content looking at the ingredients it is good food but I think it's a little overpriced I believe I'll be using Costco Nature's Domain dog food moving forward,1
Wasted money they didn't stay on. My vet put them on for me and they just don't work,0
"tried going cheap, my landlady's dog dislike me and they simply slip away out of range of the repeller.
I read this worked for others, but not in my case.",0
perfect harnesses  especially for in between sized dogs,1
Works great,1
Our small dog did not enjoy this flavor.  Seemed to be difficult to digest.,0
sturdy but make sure you have enough room. My dog did not like the first set of steps i got that were more like a ladder. This is less intimidating but does take up more room.,1
Destroyed in 30 seconds,0
"Doesn't help calm my 8 week old Siberian Husky in the slightest while he is howling to get out of his crate in the middle of the night. You can barely hear the ""heartbeat"" unless you stick the pillow right up to your ear. I am quite disappointed. I was hoping this would work well for him, but he just seems to ignore it and bark, howl and whine all night until he tires himself out... It's been a rough few nights as we try to crate train him.",0
It's very cute & colorful.very good deal for the price!!,1
"I love the little Desktop Aquarium - and my guppy loves it too.  Sadly, after a few days, the filter stopped working and then a few days later, the time/date/day display quit working.  I am afraid that I have to purchase another aquarium for my little guppy.  I would really think twice before purchasing this desktop aquarium.  It looks cute, but it falls appart at an alarming rate.  Sorry!",0
"I got this litter box because I get quite lazy when scooping. After switching out the litter a couple times, the divider inside that separates the litter and ""droppings"" into the pull out handle pretty much broke. The tab closures are also difficult to close fully if the divider is not ""snapped in"" all of the way which is constricted sometimes by clumps (this piece is not self cleaning. Gets gunky fast). All in all, you can't return something your cat has s***ted in so I've kept it as a regular litter box. I could of gotten WAY cheaper somewhere else. ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is sturdy. And it is large. If the inside piece wasn't so flimsy, I'd be happy with it",0
Way too small for my big cats. Would work great for kittens or very petite cats,0
the litter is very small grains so it just seemed to go everywhere and it would easily get stuck on my cats' paws.  the smell was nice and it clumped well but it just was too messy.,0
Great product!,1
this was okay as our girl did not care for it and now it has vanished from sight.,0
Great value if you are looking for a way to cover your floor with stings and strands for a week,0
"This worked quite well for me, since it allowed me to buy cat food in bulk and keep it fresh. However, after using it for a year, the rim has cracked in multiple places. It's no longer air tight and thus useless. Gave it 2 stars because it is cheap, so potentially someone might buy a new one every year. Not sure how worthwhile that would be, though...",0
"Can't aren't interested. But, again, they're cats.",0
Great towel for a puppy or small dog. We have a lab puppy and it works great. Once she gets bigger we may have to purchase another one because just one won't do the trick. It's very absorbent and works great!,1
Didn't work,0
Loved this for our dogs during the Holidays!  Thanks.,1
I wear this on my riding mower when mowing trails through the woods-it works great.,1
Doesn't seem to have any effect,0
My dog LOVES THESE!  It is his favorite treat!,1
"or the cage it came with.  Very odd.  I wonder what the ""engineer"" might have had in mind for this dog water bowl.  word word word word",0
"My beautiful kitty's new best friend.  He absolutely loves this collar and as a bonus it's a safe break-away one.  Although he is smart enough to get it off, he always brings it to me to put it back on him :-)",1
This comes apart easily so you can break it down in the car if needed.  Best of all fido loves it.,1
Great product! Works exactly as described and really easy to install with some planning. I hard plumbed my intake and return of my Biocube 29 and I've had zero problems with it.,1
My cat really likes this one. Likes the extra gravy ones the best. They use meat by-products in their food.  Up to you.,1
Our dog sort of laves it,1
"Shipped directly from China. The chain is only a fraction as long as the picture. No way a conure can even fit on it, much less swing from it. Very suspect looking paint on the beads. I don't even want to know how it gets made and shipped from China to the US for only $3. Thrown in the trash. Not worth risking my birds life on it.",0
The seat cover works just as expected.,1
I ordered because it was silent. but it was not. so I returned it.,0
"I bought and used this 'The Easy Dog Tag'  once (and one other brand once), so we could easily switch the tags to other collar.  But, I've had to order THREE name tags for my dog because somehow my dog has managed to break these clips and LOSE 2 sets of tags already!!  So, they must be pretty cheaply made for that to happen!  Needless to say, I will NOT, be buying or using this 'easy' clips anymore!",0
"Great idea but way too easy to unscrew after a half hour of play. I had intended to use his for my guide dog when the weather won't permit out out for walking. After two days, I have to change plans and use to feed him instead. On to search for a few toy ",0
"I don't know what is going on with the quality of marineland LEDs.  They don't seem to last.  I bought a hood led combo 2 years ago.  It lasted a year and the lights flickered and wouldn't turn on.  It looked like I was in a disco.  I had to buy another led light for it.  When I bought my 65 gallon with glass top I purchased this led strip. It is awesome!  But 5 months later the timer reset itself.  I adjusted the time and a day later it reset itself again.  Went through the same routine and a day later you can only guess what happened.  I sent an email to marine land but I doubt I will get anywhere.  I just bought an aqueon brand so we will see if I have better luck.  I have been running aquariums for 30 years.  Never experienced so many problems with a brand before.  No more marineland for me.  And by the way, my light never got wet. I take care of my stuff!",0
Nothing against the product itself but the package came ripped and was spilled in the box and got wet so pretty much was no good. Guess it's just safer to buy in the store.,0
"The product itself is great! It was easy to install and works well with my 5lb chihuahua and my 20lb mini Aussie. The magnet is Very strong which is great for keeping the bugs out, but also proves to be a deterrent for my smaller one sometimes as it does take a lot more strength for him to push through. Plus, white interior frame between the two flaps is a little slippery which proves to be a slight issue for both of them.
In the bigger versions with bigger dogs, I can't imagine that being an issue because they would get through the door faster. However, it is noticible in the smaller ones that move slower through the door.
I would absolutely buy it again and recommend for the price and ease of installation.",1
Saved my dogs life!!!! I would suggest everyone have this on hand! Especially when medical treatment is not available! AWESOME!,1
"It's great. My cat loves it and the sides are high enough that I don't have s much litter on the floor. Easy to clean. I don't put the full amount of litter it will hold, so it is harder to throw the litter out when in use!",1
cute and easy to keep on,1
"This toy ( supposedly made of durable material )  Ripped in 10 seconds , two trows and it was in pieces , if you have a dog that likes to bite into a toy before they return it , don't buy this one,  good concept ( soft rubber , won't hurt teeth or gum's)  but not worth it ,",0
"These used to be made with real fur. Not anymore and my cats couldn't be bothered with them. Win some, lose some......",0
"This supplier: EntirelyPets is not to be trusted....  I spoke with someone in good time at that company this morning, he said it the product had to be accessed at their across town warehouse and that was the reason for delay.

After that call I looked in my e-mail and noticed that there was an automated reply from their company showing that the order was cancelled.

This is a product my vetrinarian said my dog needed, because her liver is way above normal for it's reading.

I then called repeatedly to the vendor ""EntirelyPets"" to find out what is truly happening with this order.  With over an hour of phone calls, I was repeatedly put on ""terminal hold"" by this company, with them disconnecting twice.

I would never order another product from this company, and am making this review to help keep others from making this mistake also.",0
My chihuahua loves the taste of this. They don't have the easiest mouths to take care of. Using the right little toothbrush and this dental paste has changed her whole attitude about dental care. I give her a couple of extra little tastes during the process to sweeten the deal.,1
Works like a charm!,1
"This product is not very useful to me. There is no mechanism at all that delivers treats one by one! It literally is just an opening at the top and at the bottom. You stuff the treats into the big hole and squeeze the rubber to get the treats to fall out the bottom. I have tried three different types of treats (kibble, small bone-shaped treats, and Zuke's mini naturals) and they dispense an unpredictable amount of treats. That makes training a little inconsistent, and if you need anything to successfully train a pup, its consistency! Furthermore, treats actually kind of get stuck when you squeeze the bottom opening and this stretches the dispenser. I have not had it long enough to know if it does long term damage to it, but my guess is that keeping it stretched all the time is not a good thing.",0
I'm sorry to say my little parakeet didn't care too much for these bones they're just little too hard they're more for a parrot not a parakeet,0
"This carrier might not be good for every type of dog. I am a  Westie and love to travel; I am happy to be in the bag and don't move around. My 18 pounds put enough weight on the wheels to keep them turning. From what I can see the bag is easy to pull and turn, with the strap adjusted to the shortest length. So far, the bag never tilted. I travel by commuter train, it's exciting to be pulled in the bag instead of being carried. I have a Sherpa carrier without wheels to travel by plane; the Sherpa on wheels would be too large and too heavy to meet the requirements for cross Atlantic flights. As far as the bag itself is concerned, I prefer the Sherpa without wheels because the frame is more stable and I don't like the shades, they should be removable all together. When it is hot in summer time I need as much air as possible and I want to see what's going on.
Yours, Ruby WhitePaw",1
My dog hated it.  ;-(,0
pups love them,1
Purchase this for my 9 pound furry baby and it was a hit.  She won the Halloween contest!  Thank you for making a great costume.,1
"This bed lasted less than 2 hours. If you are thinking of ""saving"" money by buying or replacing a more expensive bed with on of these - Don't Do It!",0
Wanted to.put 5 stars....just n ot my day...5 STAR COMPANY,1
I was a bit skeptical when I first received it... but my jack russell loves this toy. She pushes it all over the house and has learned how to pick it up and throw it in the air. I did have to trim the rubber stoppers on the ends so more kibble would come out. It is really well made and practically destructive-proof. I would highly recommend this toy.,1
"This toy is tough!  Maybe it's because it is almost too big for my 40 lb Brittany to fit in his mouth or it could be that it is really just that tough.  Buddy destroys everything I give him, but so far this appears to be Buddy-proof.  Great toy!",1
Product seems to work fine. Bottle was open and leaked on order.,1
Love this! My pups have too many toys to leave laying around and it is the perfect addition to any room to contain there toys... until they drag them all out at the same time :),1
Ferret just flipped it over even as it was hooked on. Pretty useless.,0
Ordered 2 of these ..1 is perfect the other is missing half of the leaves. That's something that should have been caught while processing the order especially since 2 were in the order..it's obvious seeing 2 side by side that they are not the same. Annoying to get poor service like that just because someone didn't pay attention to what they were doing  because other wise I really like this plant .,0
Only interested my 2 kitties for a minute & then nothing!,0
"Perfect replacement for the small pump that came with my10 gallon fountain.  Nice long cord.  On highest setting it pushes water vertically about 9"" through a 3/8"" flex tube and then 3"" into the air.  More powerful and less energy use than the original pump.  I recommend putting a sock filter over the inlet to help prevent clogging.",1
Sturdy and Classic,1
"We got the purple one, and he's pretty cute. Keep in mind that when they say medium, it's actually quite large compared to most ""medium"" dog toys. I have a small dog (miniature schnauzer puppy, currently 9 lbs) and he loves to play with it and carry it around, but there's no way his jaws can get around the toy to make it squeak, which is rather a shame since he goes crazy over the sound of it! It's quite hard to squeak for me too. I'll try to update this when he grows up and see if he can manage to squeak it on his own.",1
Works real well,1
"Dog hates it. The material is scratchy and my girl is used to more luxuriant bedding, sad to say.  That said, it gets them up off the ground and away from critters.  I just need to order one for myself and demonstrate how terrific it is.  Doubt that would work.",0
"Needs a choice of pink OR purple, not always pink AND purple. Other than that, works as designed. I use adult incontinence pads (like a thick maxi pad) cut in half with excellent results.",1
"Only issue is it does not snap on the sides.  When you pick up the box, the entire top comes off.",1
We have ordered these balls for years. My English Mastiff rips out the inner ball within a week and carrys around the outter shell like a pacifier. She eventually detroys one every four months or so but she can not do without. Every time we order a new one she acts like a kid on Christmas morning. I have others that last longer but my mutt won't touch them.,1
I ordered 2 only got 1.,0
"I wish I had bought from Amazon, as Amazon has a customer-oriented return policy.  Below is a quote from there customer service after I request a refund when my dog broke the zipper in a matter of hours.

""The warranty on the product would cover normal wear and tear for 30 days after the purchase. This situation would not be considered normal wear and tear, as the item has been damaged from the dog breaking the zippers to try to get out. Soft crates like this are meant for dogs who are crate trained and comfortable being in a crate. If a puppy or a dog is anxious being in an enclosed space, they will break out of anything that is not held together by metal/plastic.""

I will actually admit they have a point.  But my issue is that this information is incredibly useful for a first-time dog owner selecting a crate.  To point it out afterwards and not offer some sort of help is not customer service.  I'll take my money to a company who's priority is not their policy, but happy customers.  Because happy customers come back again and again and bring friends.",0
Cat room still stinks but this stuff made a good impact. I assume the carpet pad has to be replaced.,1
"Wish I could say these helped, but they didn't. My dogs like them as treats but it has absolutely no effect on their breath (and one has fishy breathe). Oh well...",0
My three little girls just love these treats!  They run around in circles when I am getting them for them.  I break them in appropriate sizes for each one.  I feel like they are getting an excellent and healthy treat!,1
This training leash is perfect for my 45lb bulldog and is holding up well so far!,1
Great product and service.,1
We bought 3 of these and 1 that was smaller. It is a total piece of crap. All three of this model have broken the first month of use. Two had the wood split making it impossible to close. On all four the metal guides for the sliding door came off (split wood or the metal rivet broke) making them either completely unusable or nearly impossible to set. Zero for four for us. Will never buy products from this company ever again.,0
My dogs refused to eat it.,0
Cheap material...it's broken in 2 weeks. I'll stick to Flexi brand.,0
"It looked good to me , but my cats didn't like it. :(",0
My cat absolutely adores all of the Weruva products. He is very fussy about his food but he never fails to eat up all of his Weruva. This is the only cat food I've ever opened up and would actually consider for human consumption - it is very reassuring that you can actually SEE what's in it! Great product :),1
these are great for protecting your floor and teaching potty training.,1
Work very well.  I had it put in a wall and had to use a extra spacer.  The two flaps does well on keeping the weather out and was not hard for my dog to get use too using.,1
The box is worth more than the toys- very disappointing-cats won't touch them,0
"My puppy managed to get her leg stuck and proceeded to yipe in terror as she tried to escape  until my wife got her out, seemingly unscathed except for the scare. I'm sure this won't be a problem for many dogs due to the size of their paws vs. a puppy's, so you could chalk it up to freak accident. But for me, I can't recommend it. I think it's a design flaw that could be remedied by not creating open spaces to get legs stuck in.",0
Good.,1
Happy so far,1
"My cat loves it but it leaks like crazy.  I have to keep it on a tray and it leaks about half its capacity of water each day.  I can't find the source of the leak, either.",0

"I needed a bowl that my clumsy dog would not tip over, to ensure he had water all day while I was at work.  This is perfect! I cannot imagine the small, though...the large is the perfect size for my 20-pound long-legged terrier.",1

Cheaper (quality) than genuine Loc-Line.  Apparently not cheaper price.",0
"Fontline Always Works.  Fleas were terrible this fall.  One day I noticed my cat was infested. When I could not find the Frontline spray locally,  I quick ordered this spray online. The shipping information indicated that it would take days to ship, so I purchased a pet friendly organic something, hoping to tamp down the infestation, before the Frontline that I knew would work, would arrive.  Fortunately, that product worked well.  Even more fortunately, the Frontline arrived days before expected and was available for the next wave of the fleas.  I think I only had to use it once and the fleas were gone for the duration of the fall.  I consider the spray to be more economical than the little glass ampoules that you break and rub into the nape of the neck.  A little spray rubbed into the back of the neck and down the back, places the cat can not lick, seems to be equally effective. I use a plastic bag over my hand when I apply the treatment and then turn it inside out and put it into the trash.",1
These are good for my dog and she loves them. Will order again.,1
i bought one at petco on clearance. my kitties love it so i bought 3 more.,1
Would not recommend. My poor girl has had terrible diarrhea for over 2 days after we started feeding her this in the first week.,0

Excellent product.  It looks beautiful in the home and can be rearranged into multiple useful configurations and can block both the hallway and the kitchen in my daughter's home.,1
I have been home several times and the feeder did not feed my pet.  How many times had it skipped meals when I'm not home?,0

"I bought the Litter Locker II system over other litter systems because many reviews stated that it worked well with standard inexpensive 10-gal trash bags. In my experience, yes, it does work with regular trash bags, but you don't get same odor blocking with trash bags as you do with the intended refill cartridges. While the refill cartridges are expensive, I absolutely prefer using the official refill bags. They complete block odor (even when I have to remove a full bag and have it sit by the door for a few hours until I make it out to the trash). They're easy to use and, in my opinion, worth the money.",1
My cat like it. Unfortunately it didn't cut down on his scratching which was the reason I decided to try it.,1
I was very impressed with the quality of the product and the grass pad lasted much longer than I expect with light watering. It came very quickly in the post after I placed the initial order. I have a small dog (Chihuahua) so the size was adequate though training was a hassle with her. The sales person through their website recommended getting it sprayed with a special hormone to encourage the dog to use it but I figured it wouldn't matter. I think next time I'll take this option as my dog is difficult and was very much a snob about the grass pad.,1
My bird loves it,1
Love it!!!,1
My Scottie eats this along with the organic food I make him. He is picky but he goes for this when he needs a snack between meals!,1
worked perfectly!,1
"This product helped my dog con her pain, only with half pill is enough for my dog feel better. It is a good product.",1
Did not work at all on my dog.. seemed like it was old or expired,0
Only lasted about 2 months.,0
I purchased this at the recommendation of my vet and it really did not help. It didn't hurt him so I am not that upset. I hear it works for some but sadly not my cat.,0
My cats still have fleas.  I give it one star because there are not as many.  I found out later that my vet doesn't recommend Frontline at all.,0
Merrick is all natural and my dog loves it.,1
"I first bought these 3 years ago after failing to house break my chihuahua and I am still using them today with my papillions. They are fantastic for everyday use and wash up nicely. My pups stay inside my condo during the day while I am at work and these pads have been a godsend. They have saved me a ton of money on disposable puppy pads and they wash and wear beautifully. When puppy urinates on them the moisture is dispersed and doesn't puddle so they don't track the urine onto my tile or carpet. However, because the moisture disperses it has the appearance of a much bigger wet spot when it's dry, but it is actually dry, and it dries much faster.  They are perfect and I would recommend them to anyone who uses disposable pads on a regular basis. I use one on the counter after baths in the sink to absorb the extra moisture.",1
"Our cats LOVE this feather teaser. Our older cat (10 yrs) is a true hunter and will jump, leap in the air to catch the ""bird."" I recommend this activity on carpets for spectacular leaping and cat safety. Our younger cat (1 yr) prefers stalking and pouncing on a ""lame bird"" and that's why the bell is great. Both cats will prick their ears and engage their whiskers when we get the feather teaser out. Our vet is considering ordering some for their boarding too. Great product!",1
Great for cleaning dogs teeth,1
Purchased for my puppy.  It didn't even last 15 minutes before it was torn up.,0
"Good quality leash, the handle near the collar drags down to floor if the dog is not walking too far from you. Just a slight design error.",1
"I like that this has natural ingredients BUT they should warn pet owners to test a small patch on their animals before spraying it all over them. My cat and one of my dogs seem to be okay so far but my other dog went absolutely crazy. He was pacing, scratching, crying and shaking. I couldn't touch his back without him screaming in pain. I had to wash him again with very mild shampoo and cool water. He's feeling better I think but don't know if he will have welts develop like on one of the other reviews. I have since read that cedar oil can be highly irritating so be careful!!",0
It took a little getting used to for both of the cats but it has definitely become a favorite spot to sleep AND it has detoured the boys from scratching up the couch which was the main goal. Can flip it over when one side is scratched up. Nice modern design. Will likely order a second one soon as they are starting to fight over it!,1
"There is nothing negative to be said about this product itself.  While the ""Home Again"" SERVICE does charge an annual fee; the PRODUCT description plainly states that you can register this product with the AKC which charges a one-time fee; also with ""PetLink""-one-time fee, ""Found Animals""-FREE, ""RFID-USA"" one-time fee w/ minimal charge for changes, & multiple other services.  As a matter of fact, registering with more than one isn't necessarily a bad idea since you never know which one will get searched.  Just do a little research; there are lots of services out there; Home Again is just one of the most well known.

I am having all the animals in my immediate family chipped for Christmas (about 10); this is a much more cost effective way to have that done & my Vet has agreed to implant them all for us for free.",1
Not to happy very hard to read the ingraving I would recommend only two lines top or ingraving is to small to read. Also seems like the ingraving is not deep enough.,0
"Too many dead worms when I received it.  I have 6 bearded dragons to feed, so I felt I wasted money with dead worms.",0
I was never going to have to scoop poop again due to this marvelous new kitty litter Technology. The first few days it worked perfectly. After only a week the plastic tabs holding the whole thing together started to lift causing litter to escape after every roll. So instead of scooping twice a day... I'm now vacuuming twice a day. Also the Grate inside cracked almost immediately.,0
Did not want peanut wanted plain only,0
"First of all, this thing would not remain adjusted. I adjusted it to the size of my dog and then jsut by her being around the house it would slowly slip and open. Luckily, I noticed that the first time and since we use a martingale collar to take the dog out it wasn't an issue, but if you attached a leash to walk the dog, the dog would slip out. We decided to keep it just to decorate my dog inside the house. My real issue came only a week after I bought it. The battery compartment popped out and fell on the floor! Luckily, I would never leave my dog unattended while she was wearing this so I actually saw it on the floor! This could have killed her if she had swallow it! DO NOT BUY IT! Very poor quality and can pose a real danger to your dog. I will never buy something like this again.",0
Heater fried 31 days after purchase....1 day out of warranty.,0
All it takes is an hour of play time and it falls apart.  If the dog didn't love it I wouldn't have bought another one. They need to be made like the original one harder plastic.,0
"I purchased two of these collars for two of my cats. Both collars were put on less than a week ago, and have already began to fray. I couldn't recommend this as a quality product, one star.",0
I returned the item to shipper and still haven't received a refund ready to complain to the better business bureau,0
"My initial order arrived with only a roof in it (nice roof!) so I sent it back after a few days when the body/house never showed up. I ordered it again, and once again only a roof showed up! so weird.

I can't recommend buying this product if you actually need a house to go with the roof, and $200+ is an expensive roof!",0
My cats love this brush and I love it because its easy to clean!!  Fast shipment and great price,1
"Like others, I wasn't sure the bed would ""fluff up"" when I opened up the box and unwrapped it, but after a few hours it was fine.  I introduced the bed to my dog (almost 13 years old now) by putting his old bed on top of the new one.  He is not very good at adjusting to new things, but he was fine with this bed.  Eventually I took the old bed off and put them side by side to see which one he preferred.  He picked the Better World Pets bed, so that made me happy.  It is high quality and I like the fact that it is waterproof.  I didn't realize that Better World donates a portion of the proceeds to the humane society, so that makes it even better.  I would definitely recommend this bed.",1
Broke within a week. Tab on center cap broke allowing cat to get ball out.  Cat loved the ball by itself.,0
No real smell to these.  My dogs are not very interested in them.,0
"When my cat tries to scratch, on the pad, the scratching causes the Scratcher to tip over  and does not allow the cat to scratch.  Terrible and frustrating for my cat.  Do not buy this type, make sure the Scratcher is flat so the cat can enjoy the scratch.",0
"It would keep my dog itch free for maybe an hour.  We went through the bottle in about 5 days.  I very much dislike that I do not know the products.  I don't want to steal the 'recipe', but rather, know what I am putting on my dog.",0
"I'm giving it 2 stars only because my cat does love this toy. We wanted something realistic and these looked like they were. When we opened the package several feather fell off and now it has about 4 feathers! Within the first hour of play, half the feathers fell off and I had to go around a pick them up. He still plays with it, and it looks like the few remaining feathers will stay put!",0
"Comes smaller than stated. Measured exactly as suggested, but would not fit what so ever. Ordered two sizes larger though and took a chance on this company.  Also the back part is EXTREMELY SMALL if you order a small, that is will maybe fit a mini chihuahua or toy size dog, not a normal small dog and the strap, which is the part you measure is smaller.  Thus, if you dog has a 16"" around size around the chest portion, order at least size bigger.",0
"The spray worked great at first. One bark, spray goes off and the shocker of it in her face and the scent stopped her from barking. But then my dog got use to it and would keep barking even while it's spraying her.",0
"Not quiet at all, just a regular whistle, it does seem to have different tones by turning the base...just not what I was looking for.",0
"The harness seems sturdy and well made.  Unfortunately, the patches are another story.  Within 5 minutes of unpacking and assembling the harness, a significant portion of the patch lettering rubbed off.  The lettering is quite delicate and totally unsuitable for the use intended.  I contacted the seller and after I sent the requested pictures of the inferior product (Pictures...really?  For a product that cost pennies to manufacture?), they agreed to send out a new set.  On the positive side, the seller's response was speedy and the new patches arrived within days.

My suggestion to future buyers - Immediately spray or brush a coat of water based polyurethane clear coat on the patches before you even touch the surface.  Allow 24 hours curing time before handling the patches.

My suggestion to the seller - Find a source of embroidered patches to offer with this harness.  It will look nicer, last longer and eliminate the expense of replacing the crappy patches you currently use.  The overall price might be higher but I would have preferred to pay a bit more to avoid the entire complaint process.

The purpose of this harness is to clearly indicate to the public the capacity of your working dog.  Without patches with sturdy lettering, the Velcro harness makes no sense.",0
"Bought these to use as blood point tokens in games of Vampire: The Masquerade. Was sorely disappointed upon opening them to find that they were not a clear uniform red like in the photos, but instead had some kind of opalescent finish on them. I'm going to have to try again from a different listing and hope to receive the actual product pictured.",0
"Love this little towel! When I'm lucky, she waits to shake AFTER the towel goes on!",1
"Had product for only a few weeks and fountain motor died.  Cleaned it every week (as manual stated).

After further inspection, discovered product was USED and made in early 2007.  Very disappointed in the deception when advertised as ""new"".  Again, very disappointed in the sender of product.  If new, may have lasted longer than a few weeks based upon reviews manufacturer's website.",0
"Description said they were 1 3/4"" in diameter,  but they were regular tennis ball size  much too large for my little dogs.",0
Not flexible at all.  Really stiff.,0
"We have a thin, long, tall cat. Not abnormally big,  but long enough that he does not fit anywhere on this thing. The houses could maybe fit a large kitten.  We had to take off two top perches and the top house to give him somewhere to sit.  Also... the ramps are extremely flimsy.  There is only one hinge, which makes it extremly breakable should you hit it slightly wrong when moving it. Overall... bit waste of money.  I am dreading moving it anywhere. Uhg!",0
"My cats love it! Just be careful when laundering it. I wish it included a warning on laundering it. I dried it with the rest of my cat's bedding, and parts of the back of the mat were scorched. I bought several others, so I'll be careful when washing those",1
Probably the worst tjing I've ever bought.  Timer loses time each day so it cutw off earlier and earlier each day.,0
I haven't seen any difference and have been feeding this for a month now.,0
"I bought this scoop because all the commercially available scoops at local pet stores have slots or holes that are too large.  This allows the  smaller pieces of clumped waste to fall through and back into the litter box.  This scoop, at least for the litter I use, has the opposite issue....the the holes are too fine and it takes forever to sift the cat litter through it.  Build quality is excellent.",0
"This product has worked wonders for my dog, she is back to her good ole self.  She clearly was suffering with hip issues and found it hard to climb stairs, or hop up on the bed.  My husband did some research and decided to give this a try.  It really does work as it states and we have recommended it to our friends.",1
"This is supposed to last, it lasted 15 minutes. Not a happy customer with this product.",0
My cat loves all Yeow toys. He is older yet we still enjoy watching him unwrap his Yeow presents. You should try!,1
The information on the tag is already fading. Just got it.,0
It does not work. My cat still goes to the bathroom outside both of her litterboxes.,0
My dog loves this toys.  Subtracted one star because when it arrived it had an extremely strong patchouli scent (unexpected and not my favorite),1
"Great table, easy to store and to set up.  Perfect for me to groom my small 9 lb Bichon/Shih Tzu dog.  I wouldn't suggest too much bigger on this table.  I guess it depends how much your dog moves around :)",1
Cats wouldn't eat,0
"These don't mask the odor as well as other brands, but still work well. We just change a little more frequently.",1
This Drinkwell is horrible. The spout is to close to the side and the water is constantly running down the side even though its resting on a tile floor. I have had to mop us water several times.  A complete waste of money!,0
"Well made. Fits our Gerberian shepsky perfectly. She seems comfortable in it. She has a tight girth of 27"" and the medium goes up to 29"". Thanks",1
"My parrots love this mix. Easy to prepare, freezes well for a short period of time.",1
"Doesnt really work, gave them dandruff.",0
As described,1
New kittens who are scratching on everything. So I tried this on the ends of my couch. My kittens tried to eat it. It was so unsticky that she just used her tiny baby teeth and worked at it. Don't waste your money.,0
"Received two as a gift.  Very nice looking.  So why one star?

The collar is SO breakaway that it comes off too easily.  In 30 days one cat lost it while outside never to be seen again and the other can remove it with some effort.  I keep putting it back weekly or so but oblivious this defeats the whole reason to have an ID tag on your pet.

So... If you have a docile, slow moving cat that sleeps 18 hours a day and doesn't move much.  THIS IS YOUR PRODUCT!

ps - many of the '1 star' people listed the bell as annoying.  I would give THEM one star since the bell is easily removable.",0
"Wow!  This product is great!  I haven't had a lick of problems with my CatGenie.  I have one cat, and he has become quite fond of it. It's a breeze to set up and the instructions are easy to follow.  I installed mine in the laundry room so it would drain using the laundry drain tube.  It's perfectn for the most part.  It does smell while it is scooping poop ,but, what else would you expect, so I just close the door to my laundry room, or run it at night while we're sleeping.

Thank you CatGenie!

The only improvement that I would request is the ability to have it autorun after the cat has left the box so that the waste doesn't sit there until it is manually run or it is run by the set time.  It would be a good option.",1
These control hairballs and constipation.  cat loves them,1
"You get what you pay for, that's for sure. But we have three cats and they're going thru one of these refills per week, at least. At $12-$15 a piece, that's quite a bit of dough burn thru each month. Lower odor release than any kitty litter by a ton. Easy to change. But a bit messy. The cats seem to ""carry"" a lot of grains out of the box onto the floor. If you can handle the expense, they work as advertised and are better than any other kitty litter, hands down.",1
DOESNT HAVE GOOD SUPPORT,0
"My dog loves this toy and carries it around with him everywhere he goes. I bought them for my boxer, and he carries it around with him everywhere. It is as durable as expected, so my dog has chewed the squeaker out and the stuffing, but he still loves to carry it around and chew on it.",1
"When we rescued our second dog I learned to be more cynical about plush toys and their durability when compared to a medium sized dog with some rea power in his jaws (vs our 10 pound previous rescue). I bought our first godog toy at some clearance sale and hesitated to give it to him as I wasn't sure I'd want to clean up the pieces later. That first toy we still have a couple years later. I bought a second godog toy that has also held up fantastically to a 35 pound med to aggressive chewer and drooler without looking immediately disgusting, they held up to outdoor use and regular play for years. He also had a large lizard plush that he'd sleep with when he was still nervous about being around people that wasn't meant for such an aggressive chewer, after a different dog destroyed the toy he slept with I opted to replace it with this one, seeing as our other godog toys held up so well. We received it in the mail at around 2pm, by 5 that evening they'd managed to chew a leg off of it. Frustrated that the priciest of their toys has turned out to be the one that was the worst one we'd had.",0
"This is awful! I have it on the most sensitive level possible. It doesn't activate hardly at all. Maybe once in a great while but not often enough to do anything when  my puppy non stop barks. The sensor is on the back between the prongs and I had to directly up close and personal blow into it to set it off. It is very humane, only a vibration equivalent to ur phone vibrating but what use is it when it doesn't work 90% of the time!? I would return but had to cut off the slack since my dog is smaller and collar was too big so now I can't. Just wasted money on junk when I should have got something pricier and more efficient.",0
Omg so darn cute!!! My kitty be Blinged out,1
Arrived on time. A fabulous light. Love it!,1
Working great for me and my pet.,1
Came quickly and was just as described.,1
"This tank is alright, I really loved it when I first got it, until certain problems came to play.
1: The pump it comes with is weak. You cannot put the air stone to the bottom without it stopping. I guess the water pressure is greater than the pump's power
2: Small fish can get into the cylinder tube where the air stone goes through (they provide a covering for the top of the tube, but fish still find their way in and the only way to get them out is by taking out the tube (and since its inserted into the ground filter you have to completely take the tank apart) or hope your fish is smart enough to swim out. I bought this tank for my baby Mollies, they aren't smart fish
3: (AND THIS IS WHERE I REALLY GET UPSET) I've had this tank set up for about a month, the green LED already went out, and the individual colors are not as bright as displayed.",0
"Maggi is so proud to wear her vest, reserved for outings.",1
I DO NOT recommend this product!!  We used it on our beagle once and it literally almost killed her.  I put it on her on Saturday evening and Sunday morning she couldn't hold her head up and she spiked a high fever.  We took her to our vet and had to admit her and she was in intensive care.  We almost lost her.  Our vet said that she had a reaction to the chemical Permethrin found in this product.  One dose cost us $14.15 and her hospital stay cost us $235. BUYER BEWARE!!,0
The red collar looks amazing on my black dachshund. Received tons of compliments!!I would recommend 100%%,1
It didn't last as long as advertised. my 10 week old pup was scratching again in 1-2 weeks after being treated.,0
"I'm more than certain that these are ment for dogs, because they're massive and don't curve at all. I received a different set form another seller and you can tell the difference. Not sure how to make sure you receive the cat editions, but if you end up with these, do not try to put them on your cat.",0
"The delivery was as promised, unfortunately, my dog after one and two days, could not comfortably digest the produCT so we discontinued use, however, it is important to note, he is sensitive to any change in his diet, but since he vomited a few times during, I decided it not worth the risk to continue.",0
"I cannot say enough about this litter box! I no longer dread cleaning the litter box. It's clean, no litter and NO SMELL. Literally none. I really do recommend this litterbox to everyone. Even if you don't have cats, go get one. Just because this box is cool. ",1
It was sent with another mirrors broken perch! The breaks don't even line up. It is very rude to send something if it's already broken. And I didn't need just a mirror I need a perch with a mirror of my birds.,0
"The best bags, bar none! Strong and reliable. Love the fact that they are dark black.",1
"My vet recommended these for my dog, who has Horner's syndrome (and cannot blink his eye properly) but he refuses to wear them. Maybe you really can't teach an old dog to like something new. If you're concerned about your dog's eye health, start them with these as a puppy.",0
Great product,1
"very thin bags, cat tore through bags and he has no claws",0
"I would have bought this shirt, but the color is random. If you have a boy dog why would you want to take a chance that you would get one of the two pink shirts. If the pinks were omitted I could deal with getting any one of the other colors.",0
Cheap plastic. Not good quality.,0
Perfect!,1
Cheap Cheap Cheap!!!! fell off in 1 month and got all scratched making it impossible to read the dog information.,0
"Ive tried everything to get my boys to quit spraying but this was what it came to. I wish it had been clear however, that you have to use cut up pads or diapers with it, but thats ok. My dogs HATE it but they will have to get used to it. :)",1
It worked very well.,1
"I used this last winter for my chickens. Thought it worked great, but in the spring when I took it out I noticed the plastic bottom had melted!! I will not use this again for my chickens, seems like a fire hazard. I threw it in the trash.",0
My dog loves this product.  I have been using Greenies but these are cheaper and I think better for my dogs teeth.  The bone is harder than the greenie therefore I think it will work better.,1
Perfect for my little grand dog,1
I was expecting a more powerful High frequency model!,0
Pretty much every thing it claims to be. Arrived on time and so far seems to be a quality product. It works well to get the dogs into the pick up.,1
I purchased the smaller one for my cats and they absolutely love it. I really like how it looks in our living room and the quality is great! It seems like it will last for a long time (at least for us since are cats are older and pretty calm).  Highly recommend this pet bed.,1
handy storage for many things. rolls easily. does not stack.,1
Well made product! Color choices are great too,1
Just received this and put it on our puppy.  Very nice product that looks great on our pup!  Easy to put on.,1
Did not last long.,0
Not a dog toy. He chewed it up in minutes.,0
"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.",0
"Like other reviews state, this ball flashed for only about 3 days.  My cairn terrier likes it even though it doesn't flash however she loved it when it did flash.  She would jump at it and hit it to make it turn on.  Sadly, that only lasted a few days.  The ball is quite hard and I haven't seen any real ""glow"" from it.",0
I returned it it hurt my dog,0
We love this product & have used it for years. I would give 5 stars but the product arrived damaged (crate pan cracked),1
My little girl got her new puppy and the metel cage we had gotten look terrible in her little girl room. I saw this on line and ordered it. The color is very pink but for her it is perfect. The funny thing is she wanted to play in it all the time. Took us awhile to get her to stay out of it. lol,1
Scam.  They gave me a stick. Nothing like the artful pictures displayed.,0
"Leads were in a dirty and stained condition. There is black dirt along the edges of the lead over the whole length, and black dirt on each fold of the lead. Some staining is also present",0
This brush pulled my dogs skin making him flinch and try to escape when brushing :( I would want a refund but I waited too long,0
Too small.,0
"I read about this litter box and did my research for months before I finally purchased it.  I was thrilled by the reviews stating that is controlled the smell, and that it controlled the spill of litter onto the floor.  Boy were they wrong....I don't know what those people are doing so differently....but I still have a pile of litter on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.  You can still smell everything, and I have to clean it twice as much, because the cats have a limited area to enter the box, and otherwise they would be stepping on poop everytime they got in.  I was going to purchase another of the same box if I liked the performance of this one, but I doubt I will now.  Other than looking cool, its nothing special.  The liners that fit it also do not stay in the hook and rip easily.",0
Cute toy; took my Dutch Shepherd mix 10 minutes to gut it and pull the squeaker out. Not so tough.,0
I got the items so quickly after two days when I ordered it. I bought them for the friend of my younger brother in Beijing in China. And they received the items a week ago. If the items can be posted to China directlyit will be so perfect. thank you,1
It was missing several stones when it arrived. Not impressed.,0
My dogs love them,1
"Great plants,  superb seller, and excellent quality.",1
"Horse destroyed it after 1 day, don't recommend this product.",0
"We have two Pomeranians. One of them is eight years old, and the other is seven months old. They both go crazy over these bones. It was great for the puppy, as it gives him something to chew on for a long period of time. We have boughten several bones from this brand, and the pups have enjoyed each of them. I like the size of these bones versus the size of our dogs. The texture is soft, but still hard enough to sustain their bighting entertainment. I have had problems with some chew items and it impacting the digestive health of our older dog, but it's been a few months that we have used these, and we have not had any problems. Because of this, I will continue to purchase these. Also, the seller shipped these to us quickly, and that is always an added bonus.",1
"Smells OK to me, but my five cats go hungry rather than eat it.  I will give the unopened cans to the local SPCA, and maybe their cats will eat it.",0
Definitely not as expected there is no way to hang them and the paper shreds went all over .Don't waste your money.,0
DONT BUY THIS. I don't want to EVER see a collar in my household. MY KITTY ALMOST DIED TODAY. this happened about 30minutes ago. the collar got stuck on lilos mouth and it was supposed to BREAKAWAY which did not happen. she was struggling to breathe and was growling. we tried to hold her and help her out but we ended up with huge scratches. IT FINALLY BROKE AWAY. when my kitten was about to choke to death. I cried seeing my baby in such a terrible state and I will never be buying a collar again. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS AND TAKE NO RISKS. loosing your pet is A HUGE THING and you wouldn't want it to happen by a dumb 5 dollar collar. MY KITTY ALMOST DIED. I don't even want to rate this one star but I have to. she didn't get hurt that badly THANK GOD she just got a bit of bleeding. I would attach a picture but she won't let me.,0

Dead on arrival ( few hours of work). Contacting seller didn't helped at all. Only question was asked - what's the order number. Very few instances when totally unhappy with a product and seller.,0
"Even after rinsing, it released dust into the aquarium!",0
Nice set of dog bowls.  I accidently bought the wrong size though and to return them would cost me almost as much as what they cost.... so I ended up giving them to a friend.,1
"The item received is not as advertised (there is no logo or dog graphic on it - not why I bought it, but I still think it should match the picture...) Dispenser is cheaply made and has a tendency to pop open while out for a walk, resulting in the loss of several rolls of bags before I realized the flaw. The bags, though well-constructed and thick enough for even the most squeamish of dog owners, are not biodegradable. I'll be purchasing another brand of bags when it's time to restock. I got a free dispenser from a State Farm booth that unscrews and also has a built-in flashlight, so this one is going in the garbage. Don't waste your money!",0
Doggie slipped out if it,0
We get these for our 13 year old Bunny and she LOVES them and I really think they make a great difference to her tum. She is very happy and so are we =;0),1

GREAT VALUE AND MY LILLI LOVES THEM!,1
"great value if you give your dog treats like we do , this is a great deal and saves you from having to go to the pet store every other week to grab a box of treats",1
Hard to get dog into and she did not like it,0
"I started buying this product for my guinea pig in April. The first batch I got was excellent, it came in a big box, uncompressed, it was very green and smelled very fresh. I was very happy about it, so was my guinea pig. It lasted my guinea pig for more than a month. The next 4 orders I got have been getting worse and worse. I never write reviews online, but I wanted to warn the other buyers of the quality. I saw that other people have also seen the quality getting worse. Now the hay is mostly dry, there are A LOT of brown pieces. It is definitely not worth the price you are paying. Sadly, I have to look for a new brand. I hope they bring the quality back, otherwise, don't buy it...",0
Item did not come with the velcro patches.,0
"Not eating it, add it to the dry food and started out fine but lately it has lost it's appeal????",0
DO not buy calcium sand for your reptiles or hermit crabs! Calcium sand hardens when wet and impacts in the bodies of your pets! DO NOT BUY CALCIUM SAND FOR ANY PET EVER,0
No fleas,1
I've been giving this to my pup for 4 months and she still eats poop..,0
"I purchased this for a senior Australian Cattle Dog (aka ACD aka blue heeler aka red heeler) and used one container and part of a second before starting him on a better quality dry kibble that contained most of the ingredients. He was a rescue dog of unknown age, and already had considerable arthritis in his spine, so it would likely have helped him more if he'd been getting it for a couple more years, but it certainly didn't hurt him, and I think did help some.",1
"Is crap batteries quit after my puppy played with it for literally 10 minutes it is actually dangerous for dogs if you are not watching them constantly, it can come apart and then the batteries are exposed. what was someone thinking when they made this toy for dogs. maybe for a cat as they are not as aggressive with toys . so disappointed in this toy.",0
"I am not at all happy with this litter box mat. I have a larger cat that sometimes will drizzle over the side of her box. Hence the reason for this mat. Trumpets please -- I just went to clean the litter box and mat. As I pulled up the mat I noticed the mat was sticking a bit to the floor. Uh oh. Low and behold a bit of urine had seeped into the mat. You can see in the attached photo how a bit of liquid had spread on the mat, crept through the ""water resistant"" layer and created the pattern of the mat on the floor. I like the pattern but not that much. Please note that the spray over the top is an enzyme cleaning spray I applied. I rarely write reviews but thought this was worth a read before shelling out $40 particularly if you have a larger breed cat.",0
Good rubber on bottom so they don't slide around.,1
It ripped within the first hour.,0
Great price and looked  great in my son's 10 gallon tank with a blue light up top.,1
Really hoping it would get test stains out but it doesnt...dont care for the coconut scent...it does seem to brighten up my Zuchon though!,1
Didn't work for me. Hard to put on and stay on my chairs. Spray is easier.,0
Smell goes right threw,0
"I have used this product before on my elderly cat who had chronic cystitis and struvites in his kidneys all his life. Each year he would get infections but the last 3 years of his 16 years he had no infections or blood in his urine at all! He also had greater mobility! Now our 12 year old German Shepherd has shown signs of arthritis and we started him on these chewable tablets and he is showing a lot of improvements!  I have checked on other popular brands of similar products and none have the same ingredients as this product and I feel that these extra natural ingredients make all the difference in our elderly pets health! OurVet recommended these tablets and also recommended we get them here because the Vet sells them for a price we can not afford! We were told to be sure and get the kind with the MSM as well.  We just can not get over how this product has improved the lives of two of our beloved pets and we will continue to use this for our other 2pets that are approaching their golden years! The dog eats them like treats so we have no problems getting him to take them!  The cat had the sprinkle capsules that I would put in one teaspoon of canned food and he would eat it, then I would feed him the rest of his food. Also I was concerned about buying these on here because they are sold strictly in Vets offices, so I contacted the company that manufactures them. I asked about the fact that this product can only be purchased from a Vet. I was told that was true but some Vets choose to sell them on-line, and if I am concerned I should call the manufacturer, give then the product number that is on the bottle or the box and they can tell you exactly where it came from and who sold it to whom! I know the price is still not the cheapest on line but it is cheaper than a  Vets  office so I am confident in buying it here and I feel this is a fantastic product for the health of my pets and since it lasts a long time I feel it's not really that much to spend!",1

It did't do anything it said it would,0
Love this cage easy to. Assemble love it,1
Super happy and fun to have around the house for the cats!,1
Kids love it. Throw it sidearm and the ball really skips on the water.,1
"I bought this beautiful watch for my sister's birthday, and she LOVES it! It looks just like her Labrador, Lucy! I like the watch comes with a stopper, so the battery stays fresh and new. Great price for a really nice fun watch! Great gift item!",1
love it,1
My 6 month old terrier had this for five minutes and chewed through the stitch ting Ang I had to throw it out.,0
Our dogs would not touch these. I finally threw them out after they laid around for months. We have a very un picky pug who eats anything  she would not touch these.,0

Perfect,1
"I had such high hopes based on the reviews. Unfortunately, this spray does not phase out bull terriers. I'm so disappointed.",0
my cat love this !,1
"bought this to keep my dog from always chasing the neighbors kids and wandering off. this product works great.  He learned quickly where the boundaries are and now even when his collar battery is dead and he doesn't know it, he still won't come near the boundary!  he won't even go after any cat or other dog he might see in the street which used to always get him to take off running. we live in florida with frequent storms, and although lightning did not hit my house or even nearby as far as I know, the unit fried after a storm so had to replace it.  I now have and highly recommend adding the lightning protector to save you the hassle.",1
"Dogs love it, keeping my dogs glands clean and no more scooting",1
I could not believe how well this product worked on my 2 cats.  The cats loved it and I immediately noticed less fur around the house after using it.  Best part is the price.  If you go to a pet store this would cost you double or triple what Amazon charged.  Great deal for a Great product.,1
I love the design but the zipper is made very poorly and it is a fight to zip or unzip it. the zipper will break very easily.,0
Wrong size want to return it it but cant because I missed deadline . Not good for parakeets,0
Did nothing for liver improvement. Denamarin works better.,0
Don't waste your money. We had 2 of these and both broke within a few months. After the first one we made sure to follow the instructions to clean it (which is a huge pain) and it still broke.,0
Would give this 0 stars if it was possible...One worked great the first time I used it on a regular cat food can but then I washed it and it no longer fit. I tried the other 2 and they wouldn't fit either. I'm not sure why it so hard to get a lid for cat food. I figured it would be a no-brainer. Huge waste of money!,0
"There were numerous things about this order that were wrong. Clearly the size was way off. We accepted a blue one as opposed to the black which was originally ordered as black was held in customs I was told.. The blue one if it had fit would look stupid on this muscular pit bull. I told the recipient (as this was a gift) to either re gift or throw it out. I am forced to order another now from a different company with hopes it will be better. The company did attempt to make things right,but failed",0
i am starting out with 2 stars . i don't care for the smell . i used it 3 days no results yet. i don't understand the spraying or applying to the ears or around the ears and belly ??????,0
My fish love it.,1
nice work ! Thanks,1
I'm giving this a 2 star because I don't feel confident this is the real frontline. Second month of using this on 3 cats showed no end of fleas. Fleas may have appeared slower. The 3rd month I got directly from vet office and see a big difference. Will update review in a couple of weeks just in case I'm wrong.,0
"Holy cow does my cat love this!  It's a great place to hide, for naps and for the crazy times when she feels like running through the place.  It's not super long, but long enough for my cat.  I will definitely be purchasing more.",1
Was very disappointed in this kong ball.  Due to the design my 1 yr old golden was able to bite chunks out of the ridges below the handles within 60 minutes of play.  Squeaker broke sooner.  Looked like a good idea.,0
My dog hates this stuff! The poultry flavor must not be very good. I haven't tried it though. I'll just have to take his word for it.,0
well made,1
wished there was more colors and a bit larger than expected,0
"Works great. It's a little fragile, so don't drop it!",1
My chickens don't really use it,0
"This thing is not waterproof, my dog got wet once and it fried the collar..",0
"This product seems to have made a huge impact. My cat suffers from severe allergies and asthma. After a couple weeks of just 1/8 t per day, his itching and tearing his fur out has lessened noticibly. I don't know what I would have done if I had not found this product and I will likely be giving it to him indefinitely. It's that good.",1
"My dogs don't like this toy. It's heavy-duty, but they don't like it. It is, indeed, good quality and it would take an elephant sitting on it to damage it. They just don't like it, won't play with it. Sorry! I really wanted them to like it. Maybe for a gigantic dog.... it might work.",0
"This toy only lasted about 15 min. and there was small strings all over.  With my two 40 lbs dogs tugging and chewing.  The rope is fairly soft, so they can get their teeth behind the outer layers and rip. I will never buy this product again.",0
Cost is cheap and so is product.,0
Woof woof!  Cheaper than Petco.,1
did not help my cat at all-not worth the money,0
Chickens love it so far so good,1
"Bought this for my brother's cat(s).  He reports that kitty loves, but his back side is too large to fit inside, so part of the roof was left off.  Kitty is not tiny, but not huge either.  Make sure the measurements fit your needs, but otherwise a good purchase.",1
too small,0
"My dog loved the softness of this cover.  Unfortunately, the zipper broke the first time I washed it.  I plan to keep it and try to replace the zipper because Chloe loved the cover so much.",1
"Got this for a cat that started messing in the house, as an alternative to having it put down.  She lives happy in there during the day, she has a great window view.  She is never alone in the house, in the cage.  That might not work.  At night she sleeps in a room with a person (and a cat box).  Plenty of room in this cage for food, water and a cat box.  It works for us.  But I wouldn't cage an animal all day by themselves.",1
"I very rarely ever write a review....but, this filter is fantastic!  Restarting filters after a tank cleaning was always such a chore that I often would put it off for as long as possible.  After the last one kicked the bucket, I decided to try something different.  This one works like a charm!  A few pumps to prime and it was up and running.  An absolute must have!",1
"The product label I saw on amazon mentioned containing supplement for joint problems (glucosamine and chondroitin) and the product label sent to me did not mention that, not if the product was sent to me from the above formula or the new, but I found the situation unpleasant.",0
Dog loves it,1
Just about every pellet doesnt sink on its own. They float and the only way they sink is if the float over to my HOB water filter and the water flow pushes them under water. Otherwise its great!,1
"Not for chinchillas, do not buy this for them, wish I could give no stars.",0
Not a fan! Too light. Not heavy enough.,0
"Product claim: To aid digestion and to support a normal immune response.

I bought this along with NWC Naturals - Total-Zymes for my three dogs weighing 5lbs, 13lbs, and 30 lbs. The packaging says to give one scoop per cup of food. My dogs do not consume a total of 1 cup of food per day so I give them half a scoop once per day. My dogs will not eat it if I just sprinkle it on top of their dry food, so I add a spoonful of yogurt on their dry food, then sprinkle the powder on top of the yogurt. Two of my dogs have healthy immune systems, and have never really been sick. One however has constant allergic reactions that lead to terrible yeast infections in the ears. With this product, I was hoping to alleviate that, but the yeast infections have not stopped. They still come every now and then, then clear up after treatment with otic ointment. My two other dogs have digestion issues which have not really been reduced either. I feel like yogurt does a better job than this supplement as I have not really seen any improvement in my dogs, even though I have used two of the NWC Naturals together. I will continue to give it to my dogs until the jar is empty, but I will not be buying it again. I have given this to my dogs for over a year now.",0
My dog is a fierce chewer and had 3 good size holes in toy within 15 minutes and was tearing out the stuffing. I stitched it up several times and she tore it up. Had to throw away after a couple days as she was ingesting the pieces.,0
Love it!!!!,1
"Do NOT purchase.  This is NOT an appropriately sized toy for my Macaw as it was advertised & appears in the photo. The wood is cheap, the colors blead and my bird was able to chew this thing up completely in less than 5 minutes.  Very misleading marketing of this product. I would have returned it for a refund if my bird hadnt destroyed it so quickly.",0
These work as good as the higher price ones and such a great deal!,1
my cats are afraid of it but they will come around sooner or later,0
My dogs loves it.,1
"This is a cute/novel toy for dog owners, but my dog showed no interest in it at all.  He loves balls which he can squeeze and make squeak, but this ball is hard plastic and pretty much talks by itself without help from my dog . . . boring for him.",0
"This a great product.  I have 4 dogs who drink alot and I have used a couple of waterers and this is the best so far.  It is sturdy, easy to use and clean.  My only complaint is that it does not refill quickly enough for my dogs.  When they come in from the yard one dog can empty the dish quickly then it slowly trickles back in with the dogs waiting and licking the bowl.  Still I would absolutely buy this again.",1
Does the trick!,1
"I don't think these help a lot, but our dog loves them.

She gets 2 when she comes in from getting the paper with her Daddy

She still is on arthritis meds, even though she has eaten these daily for 5 years",1
"I got this to try because it was at a low add on price, my cats loved it, I would purchase it again, but not at the full price, overpriced there in my opinion.",1
Pump was bad and did not run.  Typical piece of China CRAP,0
My cat likes this but doesn't love it.  Probably still worth the purchase.,1
"Very comfortable with a fit snug and the pouch design gives the boys some room.  I order large and normally wear a US small or medium and I have a 32"" waist.  I have order more",1
Love it dose a good job. Keeps smell down. One cat have to change the collection box once every 4 days. I put a small bag in the collection box to help keep the cost down on the buying of them but you will need to change it now and then.,1
This pet play pen came with the zipper already separated from the pen itself so I had to send it back and chose to purchase a different one instead.,0
I found it very difficult to find the right fit let alone trying to put them on. It's easier to wrap her in a blanket and clip them myself.,0
My dog won't stop barking even with this device. I don't think anything on this planet can stop his night barking.,0
Cover is already stretched out after only a month,0
Great for dogs who have itching and teary eyes.,1
"My first order of these diapers had scanty but just sufficient absorbent material in between pink plastic. Not great but cheap.
The second order were blue and I figured they were the same. They are not!  One third to half the absorbent material is missing. As you open them, some of this material falls down to the lower border.  My advise is to open the box carefully, open one up, hold it to the light and see if they're worth keeping.  Mine were so bad, I had to double them up, negating any savings.  I'm going back to the nice, fat, absorbent ones in my pet store.",0
The price was good and came when is was suppose to.,1
"my dog was able to break the brushing portion in a few quick chomps while I was brushing his teeth.  If your dog won't bite the tooth brush then it is a great product, but if he tries to chew it while you brush, buy something sturdier!",0
Helped with potty training,1
"best harness so far, great fit",1
"makes my tank a mess and created algae bloom , do not use for corals as 90% of particles are way to big for them to feed on, our have one hell of a cleaning crew ! my opinion bullshit product and fake advertising for corals !DO NOT BUY !",0
Fantastic!,1
The only lid I've found that fits all cans and works perfectly.,1
"Our dog has thrived on this food.  We mix it with Rachael Ray's dry food.  It all disappears.  When I say thrive, our seven year old looks healthier and acts younger.  We are pleased and will continue with this product.",1
Not as sturdy as stated and my dog will not use it.,0
"I was hoping my diabetic dog would like these treats, but they are so hard she can't chew them!  It's even hard for me to break them into pieces.",0
This works for my three Golden's!!,1
"It splits my cats nails. 
I don't think it hurts her but it bothers me lol",0
"Cute and cuddly,the box was easy pto hang however the hammock hoks were screwy and conected to the hammoc wrong so was implossible to hang it. Of course anyone with a brain will see the cage does not come with... it does say accessory kit after all.  I also got the cage from another place and this kit matched the covers that came with the cage.  the two large pan covers are great and easy to put on as are the ramp covers that matched that so my setup looks great. But due to the whole hammock issue i give this a 2 and a half stars",0
"We've been feeding Wellness wet food (along with a high quality dry food) to our dogs for over 15 years, including our dearly departed. When you open the can, it is one pressed can shape form, there is no dripping gravy, like some foods have that count towards ""volume by weight"" and are really a waste of money.

We get the duck, chicken and lamb. Our dogs have no digestive issues being served a different variety daily. Made in USA, bonus.

We started buying in by case online because frankly, it's cheaper. If I can save $5.00 per case and have it delivered free, this is for me. Works great for Amazon Prime members.",1
"The product did not work at all.  Seizures persisted and did not even lessen.  I went through half the bottle and then went to the vet.  She needed more water under her skin injected more often, to dilute and wash out her wastes, toxins (kidney failure).  She's almost 22 now. She also needed FortiFlora to destroy the bad bacteria in her colon.  That worked like magic.  No more smell.  We brought her back from her deathbed literally.  I give her 200 ml of water every other day and it was my husband who bought FortiFlora for her.  EaseSure might work for other problems, but not for my cat's kidney failure and toxic colon.  I believe the reason for the kidney failure was too much bad bacteria and it destroyed her kidneys.  Wish I knew earlier.  Her breath smelled for two or three years and the vet didn't address the issue at all. Again, Chiropractors come out way ahead of MDs and Vets who cover up with drugs or cut it out - that's basically all they do, and the Chiropractors and Naturepaths get at the root of the problem and fix it.  I probably said too much.  But it is so true.  I'd rather fix her from the inside, introduce more good bacteria to eat the bad and get the water she needs to flush the toxins.  After months of seizures, each one taking more of a toll to the point of almost no return, she is seizure free with the water under her skin and FortiFlora on a regular basis.",0
"My 11 month old German Shepherd loves her Pull My Leg Elephant.  She carries it around the house and tosses it into the air.

But this is probably the least durable dog toy I have ever purchased.  She ripped the legs in three places within 15 minutes.  The legs are not strong enough for a big dog to play tug of war - not even close.  The fabric is light weight and tears easily.

My wife was able to sew the torn legs and except for losing a little stuffing, the toy is fine.  But no more Tug of War.

The toy has squeakers in each of the hands and feet - but surprisingly does not have a squeaker in the head or trunk.  1 of the 4 squeakers did not squeak.  The squeakers are very light weight and will not be likely to last.",0
"too many reviews. no need to add detailed comments here. I think it's OK. Needs some getting used to. Needs some space too. For the price it does a wonderful job.
what bothered us was the smell without a swing door so I made one out of a thick plastic sheet. See attached images. Now this great litter box is even better.",1
"I bought this set of steps for my 10 year old Sheltie who couldn't jump up on the bed anymore. So I needed one that was taller.  But she would never use it at all. Even though I got my large (but within specs) behind and showed her how to run up and down. Nope!  But there is nothing at all wrong with the steps.  I put it together with my ten thumbs, and carried it to the bedroom.  It's sturdy, comes with small rugs for the steps so the animals are able to get friction for their feet, and it does fold down to slide under your bed or stash in a closet when not in use.  I highly recommend this item. Even if my dogs won't!",1
"Their greenies, you either like them or not.  I would have to feed them exclusively to know whether weight management works, and that will never happen.",1
"The picture makes this thing look waaaaaay nicer than it is... the 'cover' is actually a fitted sheet that doesn't fasten on the bottom, so you have to tuck it under the bottom of the crate.  The 'bumper' doesn't fit snugly (yes, I got the correct size for the crate I have) & it sags on the sides....  a nice little invitation for my dog to chew it up basically.  The mat is Okay, but not the most cushy, comfy one in the world.  Overall, I am so mad that I wasted so much money on this!!!!!!!",0
"Very disappointed, cat chewed the string and broke the string during the first half hour of playing with it.  A lot of $ for a toy that did not last 30  minutes.",0
love it,1
I use it for two small Chihuahuas (6 lbs each),1
"PetSafe brand electronics are straight to garbage. It doesn't seem they actually test their products before manufacturing, either that or their manufacturing is outsourced and they don't test it.

I had to buy two of these to get one that worked electronically. The 2nd one stopped working within one week. By ""working"" I mean electronically working. Same thing for their shock collars, have been through 3.

Whoever engineered this should be ashamed of the materials waste and waste of other people's time and money this has caused.",0
"One of best buy I ever did.  The dog is safe, comfortable and clean.  Having an old dog means that at time he can't hold ON at times. Now if incidents happens it goes in the retaining plastic pan under his cage floor.  The only thing that would make it better is that the instruction to assemble the would be ""much much clearer"", good thing I am mechanicly inclined...",1
"Sadly, my cat will not touch his water with this in it. I've made sure that he's not around when I pour a little into the fresh water for his bowl, but he knows something is up. I bought this because the description says no smell or taste, but that is flat out wrong. It smells like peroxide to me honestly. He can obviously smell that strong smell immediately and now he won't drink the water and meows at me and keeps going into the bathroom and jumping on the sink (a hint to tell me to turn on the water so he can drink from the tap). I'm pretty disappointed because his breath is terrible and I bought this thinking there was really no smell or taste and he would actually drink the water with it mixed in.",0
"The collar I received is only 15 inches at it's largest.  I'm talking, setting it larger than it's actually meant to go. Other than that, it seems to be a decent collar. Light has four settings; slow blink, fast blink, constant and off

Bottom line? I'd be wary if your pup's neck is 15+ inches",0
"Kinda dissapointed, the log I received is super short and stumpy. Was expecting it to look like the picture. If I would have known, I would have ordered the larger version. Hmph.......",0
Got it and didn't work try it out nothing happens except beeps,0
"Moss balls came as discribed, they came on time. They are cute as little buttons in my 55 gallon aquarium. The fish seem to like them and I swear the snail is moving them around the tank. Great product! Great customer service!",1
"This is a great tool and has a stopper for gauging where to cut your fur-baby's nails. The rubber grip helps with slipping and it locks shut so the kids can't accidently hurt themselves. All-in-all, I am completely satisfied with this product.",1
I've only used it twice because my pugs and Persian are so scared of the noise.  This is the loudest machine I've ever had!,0
In less than 24 hours both of my dogs chewed their way out of these harnesses.  They were snug fitting and were put on following the directions so there was no reason this should have happened.,0
"Very dry, had a chemical smell.  Threw it out.",0
"I loved the idea of this product (bought one for each cat) but in reality, they won't sit in it.  We kept it from July through November.  Placed the cats in there several times, tried to warm them up to it but they have no interest at all. We even placed it in locations they usually sat and looked out the door/window.  I'd like to return these but apparently, returns are only allowed for one month.",0
My dog is a 9 pound yorkipoo. This fits her perfectly and must be comfortable because she wore it without any fuss for a 12 mile bike ride. ,1
"This is a great product, sturdy, very well made, easy to use.  Could be hot if using during the summer (thick material).  I have a 6 lb. Yorkie, who fits, but if she grew any, it would be too small.",1
"I had luck with some other mint cat toys. But not this one. In less than 10 mins it was destroyed. It looked bigger in the pic than in person.

My dog is 11lbs, almost 9 months old and a pretty aggressive chewer. Maybe better for a younger puppy under 7 months.",0
"So far it's great. The fact that it's chew proof is a huge plus since I have a golden Retriver puppy that has already chewed through 3 leashes.
I would love some more colors
And one maybe 6 feet long.",1
"This thing is a godsend! I no longer have to refill my dog's water bowl every day, nuff said.",1
The welds need to be done better. Ordered several but the weld beads break apart easily,0
These have a really bad odor. Neither my cat or I like to smell it.,0
"worked great for a few months and then stopped working. I didn't change the way I used it, just one day it didn't turn on again. its a good size for a one gallon tank though, great while it lasted",0
Been using this for about a month now as directed and it has done nothing for my dog.,0
our AB started sleeping in it from day one and no longer requires the couch. excellent purchase.,1
I don't know if I got a bad batch or what. I've only fed my dogs blue buffalo. Normally I buy it in store but I took a chance and ordered online.. One had runny poop and kept throwing up. We live in a studio so I would notice if she got into something foreign. And then my other dog who never has issues started having runny poops. They started rejected they're food. So now I'm stuck with $40 worth of food. Bummed out,0
"Easy for my husband to assemble (my job was to keep the cats away as they were interested from the start). Even before it became a cat tree they were in the house parts and scratching the posts. So of course it only got better from there - they love it. My male cat plays pretty vigorously and it does shake a bit when he gets crazy, but it is sturdy enough I am not worried. Some reviews mentioned an odor and we did notice a smell the first couple days, but it dissipated pretty quickly. Also the hanging toy lasted less than an hour, but we don't care - they still play with it all over the house so as long as the cats are playing with it, we are happy.",1
"This product does not work.

I bought a used truck from the original owner who had dog in it.  They had the professional shop cleaned/shampoo the interior a few days before I took ownership of the truck.  So, the carpet/seats are very clean.  However, the odor is still there.

So, I bought this product and carefully followed the instruction, but the smell is still there after a couple days.  I applied the whole bottle on the truck (Toyota tundra)

2 stars for Amazon quick shipping.",0
"I'm not happy with this product.  I bought something similar a couple of years ago, so I thought this would be great!  Unfortunately, the bottom detaches, so the cat easily slips out between the Velcro fastening.",0
Much lighter than previous carrier. Like the top opening to remove cat and the mesh for ventilation. Seems fairly durable,1

"Our puppy ripped numerous holes in this pad during the first use of it.  This is not durable at all against sharp puppy teeth, so do not purchase this with that mindset.  Maybe it is durable for a washing machine, but I will likely not own it long enough to test that out since it seems destined for the trash in less than one week if the durability remains the same for our pup.",0
The band dimensions did not fit true to size and due to sanitary reasons the band cannot be returned. Way too expensive not to fit and be eligible for return.,0
great item,1
My Breeder suggested this for my Mastiff puppy. She loves it. Amazon is the best place to shop and compare prices.,1
"My puppy had several ""accidents"" on the rugs in my home. I used this product according to the directions. The following day, I vacuumed and all was back to normal.

the laser is really bright and gets our cats attention. well made and a good size item and was shipped very fast,1
I received this item very quickley and it apperars to be a very quality product for a great price. thanks mike,1
"I was very disappointed in this collar. I have a 20 pound mini poodle, and the alarm would sound when he ran, shook, or scratched himself. There were a few times when the alarm would sound when he barked, but there was a lot of times when it wouldn't. It was very unreliable and unpredictable and confusing for my dog. Also, the ""seven settings"" is just a dial without markings so it's impossible to know what how to set it.",0
"We have had other dinosaurs of this brand, and they were great. This particular version is for a very, very small dog. Take note of the measurements before ordering. This is a teeny-tiny toy. It's very misleading.",0
I bought this in a small thinking it would fit my cockapoo Bc it says fits up to 16lbs. The small was an xxsmall wouldn't even fit a toy poodle. Was very Disappointed that It was not true to size,0
"We love this crate and so does our new Jack Russell puppy. We have owned many soft crates before and this is BY FAR the best.  We like the ease of use and sturdiness. Easily collapses for transport with a sturdy metal (not plastic) frame.  It has sturdy netting for the doors and side windows. For the first few days our puppy scratched at the netting when she was first put in and it held up well. Smudges wipe off pretty easily. We bought the small size because our puppy was 4 pounds when we brought her home and will likely be around 15 pounds when fully grown. There is plenty of room for her to grow. We crate train all our pets. We leave this crate in the kitchen and leave it open when she is out and when she is tired she disappears into this little safe haven. She loves it as much as we do. I would recomnend this crate without hesitation for at least a small dog. I can't talk about a larger breed experience. The one thing I found out, which is easily overcome, is that the front door has a zipper that can be fully zipped one way or meet in the middle like a suitcase.  Our puppy quickly figured out that she can open the zipper if I use the ""meet in the middle"" option. So full zip it is for us :). If you are looking for a great, sturdy soft crate keep this as an option.",1

I've ordered these bully sticks many times before. This time I received a large bag with only 8 sticks!!!,0
"This can only be used once. If you watch the videos on the website, it looks like you can go back and forth, but it is a one time use thing. You punch out rings, and there is no reattaching them.

As for my experience with it...

I started using this when my kitten was 3 months. It worked just fine in the beginning. I left it without any holes for three weeks just to get my cat used to going on the toilet. Except for the litter everywhere, there were no issues at all.

After I took out the first ring, the cat spent a couple days trying to put his head in the hole, but then went back to just using like normal.

The second ring got interesting. First, the cat tried to put his head in the hole again (curiosity is what they are known for :P); then he had trouble not pooping on the toilet seat. He urinated right down the hole most times, but the poop stance he took a few days to figure out. After four days on that ring, he finally figured out to put his front feet on the toilet seat, and he was going down the hole like a champ.

A week after he had figured out the going-in-the-hole thing, I cut out another ring. This is when things got bad. He did the standard sticking his head down the hole, but everything else was bad. He pooped on the toilet seat again; I figured he just had to relearn his stance. He started peeing in my dirty laundry basket.

I used the little extra insert to go back one ring, but he just stopped pooping entirely and kept peeing places other than the toilet. I tried setting him on the toilet seat to show him that it was back to the previous ring and he cried and clawed trying to get away. He never did that before.

I gave up. The last thing I want to do is stress my cat out. He is a mellow little guy, and I want him to stay that way. Besides, if something goes wrong with his insides, I like to see it in his litter box. The toilet would make that difficult.

Summary: Too messy, stressed the cat, risks of missing health issues, more money than I wanted to spend on a one time use thing.",0
"Ordered WOOF WASHER, received a different product. Returning ASAP. Looks nothing like the authentic product called WOOF WASHER.",0
"I was very disappointed in this product.  It does not really clump, most clumps breaking into little pieces before removing from the box so the litter retains urine smells much more so than other litter products.  Cleaning the cat box (I do so every day) is never a pleasant experience but facing this litter every morning makes it worse.  Even the cat laughs at the claim that wheat is a natural deodorizer  - she does not want to cover her business!  We never really had a problem with odor until we tried this product and if this is one of the best litter alternatives than we will stick with clay.",0
"Helps my ""Bobcat"" w/back left injured hind leg. She's been on this for 10 yrs.now and I definitely know it helps the pain. I've forgotten it in the past and she's crankier and can't be handled as well!",1

My dog is loving this stuff. I love the price and ease of ordering here! My dogs coat looks healthier and more shiny. I got to sample this product for free. However all thoughts are my own and I have since independently purchased this food!,1
Easy to replace.  Ours was torn after a few years,1
"Works as expected although you have to be careful about not ripping it against anything sharp (e.g., branches, etc.).  Best when worn with a broad brimmed hat to keep the mesh out of your face but it kept the mosquitos off me.  Very pleased.",1
Cheaply made products that break easily.,0
Best Ever!! The cat door works like a charm. I think is the best thing I have bought and am considering buying a couple more. So Easy!,1
"Great product, and our dogs love it, but what's going on with the 50% price increase? Yikes!",1
Decent length for leash and the wrist area is padded on the inside so makes more comfortable for us humans,1
"I didn't realize it doesn't have a clasp. You have to slide it over the dogs head. I keep it attached to the leash, and I like it tighter for walks so I have to adjust it once it's on. Every time.",0
My dog loves these and they are great since her diet is so restricted. They are grain and poultry free. Great for training since you can tear them into tiny pieces. A little pricy but most limited ingredient treats are.,1
Cheap crap. Posts broke immediately trying to install them.  Go to Tractor Supply and get a good system for the same price,0
My cat loves them and these are her four favorite flavors. Good price for the pack.,1
Got my order and sad to see bag opened and on bottom of box,0
My dogs have a lot of fun playing tug of war with this little guy. Please note - there are NOT squeakers in each leg. Only one squeaker in the main body. I don't know what that reviewer was talking about. Toy is well constructed and has not fallen apart.,1
"This product works much better than other training collars we've tried. We never even got to the ""shock"" level; just the vibration was enough to get our little dog to behave. stop chasing the cat. The collar recharges easily and it goes into sleep mode when he is not wearing it, so the charge lasts a very long time. We only have to use it a few times a week and he is calmer and more in control of his impulses. This provided an easy solution to an otherwise tricky problem.",1
Keeps coming off the dog's paws!,0
"My dog really enjoys these treats and I like the fact that she keeps her teeth and breath fresh and clean! She gets one a day, after her breakfast. I've tried other brands but my dog aren't crazy about them, I think some are TOO minty flavored.

All these positive reviews and I see no results with it.  When I originally started buying it the product worked.  Does nothing anymore.,0
Well I don't just love these... the birds do.  My husband refuses to use any other product in his suet feeders.,1
"Putting this bulb into my kids' 5 gallon really ratcheted up the color in the fish and the tank. It provides better light than the incandescent bulb that came with the tank, and it really improved their enjoyment of the fish. Another slight positive is that it's a cooler running bulb, and doesn't evaporate the water like the heat from the incandescent bulb.

The main negative issue with the bulb is that the ""plant life"" in our otherwise easy to care for, plastic aquarium, has started to explode. Green algae growing out of the filter, algae on the inside of the tank ""glass"" and all over the plastic plants and decorative rock inside the tank.

The colors are cool and all, but I don't want to have to clean the tank every month to insure the fish don't die.",0
"Arrived with defective stitching on the mouth area, my black lab puppy destroyed it and pulled out the stuffing in less than 10minutes",0
I have a husky/golden mix. This thing did nothing. Don't waste your money. My own hair brush worked better than this item. The customer service was very good I must admit. When I told them I was unhappy with the purchase they refunded me asap.,0
"We walk our dog in a lot of areas without sidewalks, and the lighted leash is great. Problem is, we bought this in March and, eight months later, one of the sections (6-foot leash) will neither light nor take a charge. So..lack of durability gets this otherwise-good product a pretty low rating",0
Soft and pliable for soft mouth dogs.  Good weight for flight.  Much more durable that hard frisbees.  My Border Collie/German Shorthaired Pointed mix loves this.  With this frisbee in hand I can get him to do anything.,1
"This leash was advertised as 1"" but a lot larger.  At least 2 to 3 inches.  Can't use with my small dog but kept it.  Not worth returning.",0
cheap,0
It was easy to put together but the wood is thin. I bought this item a little over a year ago and I have had to reinforce all the joints on it. The roof came apart so we screwed one side down and just lift the other side for cleaning. It is great for growing out chicks or 3-4 large breed adult chickens. Moving this is difficult as it is very cheaply made.,0
bundling these gave us the opportunity to see what sizes and flavors worked best and still keep it affordable. We have to give my dog 10 pills a day currently and these make it no problem. It's nice to have some larger ones and some smaller to suit the pill appropriately.,1
I had to buy this for my chemistry class but learning about what the river next to my house had in it was eye opening! This product works amazingly! And is great for chemistry classes and to test your own water!,1
Nice mat and keeps my dog from sliding his bowls around.,1
I was a skeptic on these panels to begin with but after I got my dog's results the only part I really believed was that I wasted $80. The second star is because I got a good laugh at the combination they stated he was.,0
"Got the fountain for my cat, he likes it and uses a lot; however, he learned how to tip the bucket over and has made big water mess a couple of times already. Manufacturer need to add some type of sealing function or a flatter and wider design. For now I have taped the bucket to one of the legs of my night stand in my room. It looks horrible, but it is my temp solution while I get him better one.",0
My cats love this scratch pad. I don't cut off the ends because my cats like to rest their heads on them.,1
This broke after two days. Very poor product,0
"The idea of the cage is good, but we had to get it 2 times because the 1st was broken on arrival. When the second one came it was also broken, so was sent back . Canceled order",0

"When I purchase this light it had less than 8 reviews. Some stated the light is great and for the price it is a great value. The bad review states that the light burnout quickly and will not last. Being there were few reviews at that time I chalk up the latter as a few anomaly there are always unlucky few that received defective product, so I made the purchase. Well, after using it for less than 1 month. Both great reviews and bad reviews are right!. The light is bright, the design is stylish and the price is great but the bulb/Ballast did malfunction on mine after 23 days! Luckily I got extended period of return to Amazon because I purchased it during the holidays. If you are lucky enough to get a light that last more than 1 year(the warranty is 1 yr), it's a great value. Otherwise you will have to deal with the hassle getting it service. If Coralife has better quality control this is a 5 stars product.",0
Horrible smell,0
"Pawhut 65"" Aviary Bird Cage

I am writing to express my extreme displeasure with an item I recently  ordered, listed above.  The very poor quality and lack of sturdiness makes  this item impossible to use. An aviary is for out door use and this would never be a safe place to put a bird of any size, safely.  I purchased this for my wife as a gift., and it was not cheap in the cost.  She has a very small AG parrot and this is not only flimsy, but very cheaply made at best. The unfortunate part is that once it was all put together, it is impossible to return and ship it back. I am very disappointed in this item and consider it absolutely useless.

Thank you for allowing me to express my extreme displeasure with this item.

Used this poop scoop to pick up 3 piles of poo before mowing the lawn... already broken. Very disappointed,0
Didn't work at all.,0
Did not have any instructions with the collar. Not consistent with spraying on barks only. Would sometimes spray on  sudden movements.,0
Horrible dog bed! My dog used this for about a week before it started breaking apart. I first found thin shreds of staticy cloth around my house then brown clumps of the stuffing began to appear. The previous bed I had for her (which she shared with another dog!) lasted many years...this one is the worst bed Ive ever purchased!,0
"Our 11lb Bischon/Poodle puppy loves to play fetch with it but it is not very durable.  I was searching for a toy that our puppy could not chew apart and swallow. Based on previous reviews, I thought we found a winner. NOT.  We have had it about a week and it is coming apart already.  We will have to throw it away because it is no longer safe (swallow/choking hazard).",0
"I did a lot of research on No Bark dog collars. I was impressed with all of the reviews this collar received and all the insights owners posted. However, I did not find this collar to be beneficial in training my dog. I have a dog that barks when I leave. A friend that works with dogs came over and showed me how to use it. I set the device on the lowest setting and tried it on myself first. Was not a terrible shot for me, the experience was much like a static shock.
We placed the collar on my dog and walked outside the door. He barked and you could tell it went off because it interrupted his barking. He barked again and then seemed to go into a panic (we could not see his initial reaction) but his barks got panicky and continuous. We immediately went back into the room. The poor little guy was spinning in circles still barking, I have to say this was one of the most traumatic things I have witnessed with one of my animals. We immediately took the collar off, which was difficult because he was so freaked out by what was happening. These collars may work on other dogs this collar was not the right fit for my dog. I feel horrible for putting my dog through that experience. Please be really mindful out using this collar!!!!",0

PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH PRODUCTS LIKE THIS.",0
My cat likes these and does not play very much with toys.  They don't last too long so I bought another pack but worth it.,1
"I've had several of these over the years. I got this one for my g/f. When one of my cats was ancient, could hardly see or walk, he would still drag himself over to it and bat at it every day. With the kittens its just hilarious, good exercise and group fun. The adult cats will surround it and play a form of tether ball, shooting it around at each other. Because its a toy, they enjoy it and as a result use the scratching pad a lot instead of something I don't want to be scratched. The scratching pads themselves don't last a really long time but they are inexpensive if purchased in bulk and when one side wears out, just turn it over. For a lot of fun, sprinkle cat nip on the pad and rub it around with your palm so it falls through the corrugated holes into the bottom; my cats go simply crazy and spin the ball around at light speed until they collapse. Enjoy",1

"If you have a dog that loves to play fetch, you gotta get one of these. My springer spaniel is ""all ball, all the time"" and I get so tired of throwing the slobbery ball over and over again. With this magnificent stick, you don't ever have to touch the tennis ball again. No dirty hands, no bending over to pick up the tennis ball, and with a little practice you can really throw the ball a long,long way. My dog and I are in love with it. I am buying one to keep at my vacation home and one for my brother's dog as well. I will never be without one of these again. Try it.",1
"This is a very high quality leash (so far my Labrador hasn't chewed through it, and it can stand up to very strong pulling).  I also love the padding in the hand loops...makes it very comfortable for walking.  The traffic handle is just what you need for an exuberant dog in traffic or crowds.  The clasp is high quality also; I don't worry that it will break and my pooch will be off and running.",1

"These things drive me crazy

Sorry but I am thoroughly unimpressed. My biggest complaint aside from them being thin, is that these are a pain in the pooper to get one torn from the rest of the reel! Then, what a headache to try and open them! I walk two dogs at once and it is difficult to try to keep them both sitting politely while I am having a power struggle with these bags. If its worth it to you to save the few pennies and are ok with having to work everytime to clean up poop, then buy these. Unfortunately they are not for me.

2 stars instead of 1 because I think the bone holder is cute and you get a ton of them for the price.
But, I am going to try another bag next time.",0

would love to play with.  It's also very tough, can't be chewed away, and it probably will last a
long time.",1
great product,1
Bought two of these. Neither will stay on the can they came with or the other can.,0
"It really is awful. It says that ""natural wheat enzymes"" eliminate odor... not true. Maybe they were referring to the sick, grainy smell and immense amounts of dust that pour out of the bag. Also, it's super fine and it's super light. THIS IS A PROBLEM. It gets in my cats' fur and they track it all around the house. Getting past those two problems, it's major downfall is that it takes about 2 days to dry or else you have cat pee polenta stuck to the scooper. Just as a child would make paste with wheat flour and water, my cats' pee literally pastes giant chunks of dried grain mush all over the sides of my litter box. This really was an awful idea for a litter.",0
My cat refused to drink out of the bowl I had previously. She would hunt for water in the shower or from the faucet. Now she drinks from this bowl. Great to see her happy.,1
My dogs love this bed (we have two)..The medium is the perfect size for our 20 LB. terriers. It washes easily and has held up well.,1
"Cat loves it, now can watch the birds and squirrels through the window.  Some reviewers complain about the size, fine for out nine pound cat.
Well worth the price.",1
Cats love it!,1
"I purchased this for my elderly dogs to use when entering our 5th wheel.  The largest of the dogs is 140 lb so I needed something that was pretty sturdy and that would fold up when traveling.  I placed this on the top outside step of the 5th wheel and it seemed like it might work pretty well but was quite bouncy when walking up and down the ramp.  As mentioned by others, the surface is like a very fine sand paper (similar to a 200 grit--very fine) which doesn't work for the dogs to give sure footing so I placed a couple of rubber backed bath rugs on the ramp and it worked just fine.  The first thing we noticed was that the middle got a bow in it (at about 2 months) which made it stick when we slit the sections together so we could not fully slide the pieces together.  Then, yesterday 2/16/18, it collapsed when my dog walked down.  It actually folded up about half way down the top section of the ramp.  Luckily, since there were steps under it, it didn't totally collapse and throw my dog off of the ramp but it is totally unusable now.  So, it worked for about 6 1/2 months before it collapsed.  Note that in that time, it was not used full time but I would say it was in use for about 4 months of that time.  I will not be buying this one again.",0
"First off, I'm really impressed with their customer service. The Mr. Peanut company sent me an email personally once my item shipped, which to me is amazing. For the product itself, I have no complaints. I love the design and my dog seems to love them too!",1
It's too small for an 80 pound dog and it's too flat already didn't even support him wasn't happy with that product,0
excellent quality & bargain!  washes well!,1
"My dog has had stomach issues for years. We tried many foods when he was younger and landed on the Diamond brand. It was the only one at the time that didn't upset his tummy; however, 5 years old he started randomly throwing up. Since we've changed him to this food, he has been very regular and hasn't been sick.  He chomps it up like it's the most delicious thing he's ever tasted.",1
Two thumbs up,1
I bought 2 of these. One for each cat and with in an hour both cats knew how to reach up and obtain more food. I think these would be good for pets that are not food driven.,0
Can't believe it but it was exactly as the photo showed! Adorable!!! The fit was perfect and the outfit was well made. I couldn't have bought the material and hand sewn it for this procr,1
"Timothy hay is wonderful for bunnies and Oxbow is THE best- it's clean, fresh, and they really do stand behind their products (if you aren't happy they will make it right)",1
Product met expectations.  Bag came with small tear.  Wasn't sure if product was comprised.,1
works,1
Have tried other bag holders none worked as well as this!,1
"Does not work, after 3 months, no change in our dogs condition.",0
Too small,0
These work great for our male dogs. They stay on well and wash well. Will purchase again.,1
"slow to sip, but product was fresh",1
Perfect for my Springer spaniel.,1
I've been using this product on my dog for almost 6 years and she has never had an imbedded tick or fleas. We take her through all sorts of tall grass and places deer tick would thrive. I did find a tick on her once and it was on her outer coat dying. Wouldn't use anything else for my dong.,1
Doesn't work very well and last way less than 30 days.,0
"Bite free collar didn't work for my dog, he is a black and tan coonhound that got out of the collar also.",0
Love this brand and this is my favorite harness out of the three I have tried. The design is the easiest to put on and take off. Follow the sizing although it may seem not to what you purchased in the past.,1
Most important for our gigs hygine each day Recommended by our Vet.,1
"If you love your dogs, DO NOT BUY THIS.  The shock is much too severe and burned my poor dog.  The Petsafe brand collars are much more effective and do not harm.  Unfortunately I found this out when I was just outside the return period.",0
Sorry guys but this does not take away the staining nor the tearing of my cocker spaniel I will use it up but I will not order it again because it doesn't work and I have to add it with powdered milk for him to be happy Kama also I had to cut way down on the dosage because it gave him loose stools,0
"horrible, does not work properly. this was a huge waste of money and i so wanted it to work.",0
I have a 108lb dog and this leash holds her. It's sturdy and good quality. The handle is a little heavy but that is too be expected it's holding several feet of leash. I would recommend to owners of big dogs.,1
This sweater was very cute but ran small.  It also had many pulls and strings after only a few days of wearing.  Isn't holding up as well as other sweaters my dog has worn.,0
Only half of light lit up,0
Perfect for traveling pets.,1
To big for my dog,0
"2nd time purchasing, this is the only product that keeps our Shepard's ears from becoming irritated. She has been to the vets, special diet and more. We use this twice a week and it keeps the fungal infection away.",1
"Attempted to use on several dogs (including a discrete button push at two dogs being walked down the street as I was getting out of the car). None of the dogs reacted in any way, shape, or form. Not a hushed barking, not a head turn, not an ear twitch. Nothing. Bought to train two dogs not to bark at nothing. Tried multiple batteries. Doesn't work. Will be returning.

PS: Even the flashlight feature is weak. My phone's screen does a better job of lighting the way.",0
"Doesn't remove cat urine smell, unfortunately.",0
"There is no way I can get these onto my dog's paws and get them pulled up far enough to do their job. I found Healers Booties from Drs. Foster & Smith, and they are MUCH easier to deal with.",0
"Not what I was hoping if your bench seats have no head rest don't order like I did. You can't use it, returned.",0
"my dog still tries to dig his way out of this and tore the front, of it the mesh part, so if it was made of another fabric it would be better just the front panel, the sides panels he does not touch he just looks thru it",0
"The build quality for the toy is lacking. The connector between the two pieces of the wand is shaky. I used rubber cement on the (plastic) screws to keep it held in place. Without it, the end would come unscrewed and shake wildly while playing with it. The string also seems subpar. I've had the toy for less than a day and the string broke in two separate locations.
EDIT: The company contacted me and refunded my purchase after hearing about my issue. Their support was great to work with to come to a conclusion.",0
"One of my Boston Terriers loves it and the other snubs his nose at it.  The fussy one snubs his nose at everything though.  The one who eats these is the one who needs these and they are magical for him.  Improved his quality of life tremendously.  Great, effective product.  I am thankful! :)",1
"All dog booties I have tried, including these, either won't go on, or fall off immediately. Why is it so hard to shoe a dog?",0
Works wonders for my dog.  He can walk up and down stairs. Has been on this product for about 3 mos.  Could not even walk before using this medicine.  Thanks so much.  The last bottle I used turned to a gelatinous substance when nearing the bottom of the bottle.  My dog stopped eating his food which contained the medicine.  I contacted the company that makes the product.  Animal Nutritional Products .  I called the number on the container.  Am not satisfied with the company rep I spoke with.  He did not want me to send the product back so that an investigation of the product could be made. I returned the new unopened bottle.  Cannot take a chance on the medicine any more!  Have started him on a new medication  bought at a pet store with same ingredients as Arthrimaxx.,0
"I bought one, and then I order another one, very easy to install, I have a chihuahua inside the house and I put 2 together to have more space for him. I like it and I recommend it,",1
"My lab mix dog loves to catch frisbees but he also loves to chew them.  Rubber/plastic toys often last a week or a month but this one lasted two years with heavy ware.  He chews on it, plays tug of war with it, sleeps on it, catches it in mid air.  It is a household favorite.  We are on our second k9 flyer and I would recommend this to any dog how likes to catch and fetch.  RuffDawg products are great!",1
My puppy absolutely hated the noise but I took the box out and put in a sqeaky one and she love it.,1
Not to impressed with this Anubias. The leaves were all crushed. Hopefully it will pull through and will not die.,0
Basically the product was acceptable but our 3 dogs didn't care for them. Our 3 dogs will eat just about anything but not this particular one. Please don't let my review keep you from buying them.  Your dogs might take to them immediately.,0
Smart bones is the best and my Toby favorite treat. He likes these so much.,1
Will never buy this again and do not recommend it.  The handle is way too short and my cat totally ignored this toy.,0
This product is great because you don't have to dump used kitty litter everyday. This product traps the orders and I need to empty only once a week. I have been using this product for the past 9 years. This product surpasses my expectations.,1
"Cat hated it and didn't go near it, had a funny smell and it wasn't from the cat nip I didn't add it to it. Definitely not worth it and won't buy again.",0
Great design for the gnome and bird lovers! Get yours before they disappear! Mine is in a place of prime exposure and is working beautifully.,1
"We were thinking we were going to have to give away our dog because my wife so horribly allergic to her.  Over time though, she built up a tolerance to the dog. We credit Allerpet D with helping with that. When we got this, it immediately removed the allergens and made life tolerable for my wife.  We still use this product whenever the dog's dander gets too be too much for her.",1
"minna, my tennis ball obsessed german shepherd dog, loves this thing. the rope makes it easier for me to throw for her. the ball itself is bright orange, and so is easy to spot -- well, for me, not her -- after i have thrown it for her. it rinses clean when we bring it in all muddy. and it seems fairly sturdy, though if your dog likes to gnaw on their ball, it might not hold up.",1
My dog found this small and unappealing,0
"Fit my cat great, But wouldnt say its escape proof! it slips right off my cat. And I was sent the wrong color. Bummer!!!",0
"This is the second time that I have ordered these Teenie Greenies through Amazon for our two dogs. They usually have bad breath, and I don't notice it now at all. PLUS, the dogs love them. Excellent price through Amazon - way cheaper than buying them at the store.",1
Fell apart after he wore it one time. I got what i paid for.,0
My cats adore this toy.  One cat goes hunting continueously to try and find it so we can play.  He plays until he drops to the ground panting.,1
the top apex is not enclosed so heat escapes too rapidly and rain water enters easily,0
Received it like this and also missing the black planter part,0
"Actually, my cat loves it.  The Oliver & Iris bolster lounge dog bed has become the cat bed over here.  My pushy female cat has taken over this pet bed.  What I love about it is that it actually does repel cat hair.  I got the cocoa brown bed and thought that might be a mistake.  Anything that dark usually screams pet hair in about 3 days.  Not this bed.  I'm not sure where the hair has gone, but it is not in the bed.  The bed is a nice size with a large bolster around the outside.  While the dog loved laying his head over the edge, the cat just snuggles up inside the bed right into one of the button tufts.  This is a very nice pet bed and I'm sure your pet will love it too.",1
My dog will not eat them! ,0
Great dog food!,1
We had a large dog with long fur. this aid was to difficult to get on,0
I was having some nitrate/nitrite issues in my larger tank so I tried this product. It didn't seem to help anything as my nitrate & nitrite levels didn't change. I tried the method for cleaning and reusing it but it didn't do anything different.,0
"My Tanner 12.5 yrs was recently diagnosed w/ diabetes. I 've been trying many supposed grain free kibble high in protein. Rack up another hall for the shelter( although I may Chuck 2/3 of the bag) ad my finicky girl displayed her usual2paws up while scarfing the first portion, only to proceed to beg for her treats and snub this stuff on 3rd feeding.
Expensive waste of meowla!!
I also found the kibble which was nice and small on 1st check to be crushed to near powder one I opened the bag completely. Stacking bags?? Or due to tossing at warehouse. I'll zip my rant by noting that my love had an emergency visit w/vet today. Not certain if kibble is culprit but anal gland abscess developed. Her coat looks lackluster and matting seemed suddenly a much more significant problem. Can't recommend this kibble .",0
"Cute, but I ordered a large - which was supposed to fit Labs, German Shepherds, etc. Not even close. Might fit an emaciated Chihuahua.  The colors are nice and vivid but it ties around the waist with a ribbon, and I expected it be an elastic slip-on like the Halloween collars. What dog is not going to have that off in five minutes? So, ok, if you have an emaciated, comatose toy breed.....then this is for you. And the humane society will be showing up at your door at any moment because I am calling them.",0
"This little cave is very nice and cute in a tank, my betta loves swimming in and out of it. :)",1
"This coat is too cute and seems made well enough for the cost!  I ordered a XXL for my golden retriever because he had multiple lumps removed and we need to keep stitches dry.  Unfortunately, while it fit length wise, it would not close around his chest area.  I wish they provided more measurements.  For reference or anyone else trying to figure out if it will fit.  My guys chest is 36"" and the straps barely touched under his belly.  I would say that it would fit no larger than a 30-32"" chest measurement comfortably.  Sad I had to return this!",1
"I am not a fan, it works somewhat but my dane eventually fights me. She did alot better with the head halter with the lead at the back of the neck instead of under her mouth. I feel like I have to tighten this one crazy tight for her to obey me, that's just not worth it to me.",0
Pups love,1
"I love the water drainage area, I can just remove the top and dump out the excess water, it works great",1
"These were of a different quality than the first bag of 20 chews I purchased online.  They were the same brand, but the package was different and they were much lower in quality.  My dog had diarrhea for two days after downing one of these.  They were darker and different colors, compared to the first batch which were white and consistent. I'm almost afraid to order online again.",0
"Very unhappy with this product. They leak and slide all over the wood floors as well as the carpets. They are packaged nicely and are a good size, and we're shipped promptly. I wish the quality had been better.",0
I love that this container will hold my entire 24 lb bag of dog food with plenty of space leftover! I also like the wheels so I can easily move it whenever I want to.,1
"I've done a lot of research and this is one of the best all natural dog foods out there. My dogs love it, their skin is great, no stomach problems and they are so happy and healthy thanks to Wellness! I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO HAS DOGS!!! Try their treats too (Old Mother Hubbard)",1
I gave it away looks a little dangerous,0
th-y,1
Didn't help,0
"My cat has years using it, tough and roomy. It has not been oxidized. the tray is easy to clean",1
Very nice dog bed. Soft and my dog loves it. Hope it last,1
Extremely well priced and included shipping.,1
My dogs don't like the taste but I wrap it in cheese to get them to eat it. One of my dogs was scratching incessantly and that has stopped since she started taking this supplement. My cat loves the taste of it and it appears to be helping her skin condition heal.,1
"I bought this Mr. Bill as a 'side' Father's Day present for my 67-year-old Dad this year, in honor of the many years we laughed at Mr. Bill on SNL when I was growing up.  (He loved it.)  It seemed to be really well-made, and while it wasn't entirely easy to trigger, his voice sounded fairly accurate.

That said, we quickly learned that trying to amuse my 1-year-old niece by having Mr. Bill dance and yell out ""oh noooooo!!!"" caused her to run away screaming in terror...which was itself bizarrely funny.",1
"I bought an XLARGE for my 21lbs Frenchie... I understand they are more top heavy then most small dogs, but all of his other shirts, collars and harnesses are all mediums. Upon reading reviews, I figured I'd give it shot and buy the XL thinking it would be too big. I was wrong, it was too small! very disappointed, very cute harness.",0
"Difficult to adjust straps, extremely poor quality and clasp is almost impossible to operate. Spent half the day putting the collar on the cat and the other half of the day taking off, after which, she proceeded in ripping it up in a matter of minutes.",0
"My dog adores her car seat. She is a Dachshund/Terrier mix, 10 pounds and we got the smaller size in black to match my interior. It fits in the front and back seats and fastens securely to her harness so I don't have to be concerned about her safety on trips. Very well made, good looking!",1
"Not the most thought out product. I feed my cat a small circular type food. I had to have the opening turn all the way open for the food to come out and of course since it was all the way open it pretty much all fell out after moving it once of twice, defeating the whole purpose of purchasing it.",0
Amazon had the most affordable price for this item - and I searched low and high. I guess the cost goes into durability. This one actually seems to be of a better quality than the original one included w/ my crate. Worth the money and will come back again.,1
"I ordered these for my Shepard mix puppy. I'm skeptical of just how long they'll last as they're made of very thin material. For now she adores them and they're keeping her away from my son's stuffed animals so they're definitely serving their purpose. I'll update if/when she manages to destroy them.

UPDATE 10/2/17
After two weeks all three toys are still intact! However, out of the nine squeakers, only four still squeak. They're still lots of fun for our puppy, but I'd probably invest in something different next time!",1
"I bought this product in hopes it would quieten down my 2 year old Yorkie & my 1 year old Pohmeranian... Not only did it not even phase them, it actually made them bark more!!! I would not recommend this product to anyone with small, yappy or headstrong animals! I suppose I will go back to the ""newspaper method""!!! :)",0
"Love it and fits perfect on by ""Bluegrass"" Chihuahua!",1
"My two cats love it, and it doesn't smell bad like most other wet foods!!",1
"Dog seems to like these. But they last all of 5 minutes, even in the rubber toy. Can become very pricy for regular use.",1
This car seat cover fits my new Equinox perfectly and my 85 lb dog doesn't make it shift around as he goes from one window across to the other.  Great buy!,1
Did not like this item. My 3 cats did not bite or chew item. They were not attracted to the mint as advertised. They just kicked it around a bit. Oh well.,0
"Bought this based on the ""Not just for dogs"" review (thank you!) and it worked perfectly for a 2-day move with a cat who HATES the car. We put a medium disposable litter pan in one corner (she never used it in the car but it gave us peace of mind), second disposable litter pan upside down as a ""platform"" in corner #2, corrugated round bed and throw pillow in other 2 quadrants so all would stay put. Also secured a favorite dangling toy from the top for fun. I won't say she loved the journey but was calm and quiet for most of it. Also placed everything in den w/door open for a few days prior to trip for her to explore. I think putting in familiar items/scents helped. The 36x24x27 fit perfectly in the back of a 2015 Forester & 2 of us were able to bring cat/crate straight into the motel safely and w/o any difficulty.",1
"We bought this cover to protect the dog pillow from our new lab puppy. The zipper fell apart in the first hour. I like the cover, (in fact, we bought two so I could switch them out for washing), but had to spend the first night sewing it shut and intend to buy velcro to put around it. Would only recommend this cover for inactive dogs.",0
"love the pic if delivered pkg and my pkg, of course.",1
"Bought three and not one fits on the crate without tilting. That's fine for food, but for water that means I can only fill it half way or it pours out. What's the point in that?
I tried bending the hooks to get them to fit better, but it didn't work. I should have stuck with the plastic travel cups.
Wish I'd kept the boxes because I'd like to send them back for a refund!",0
Great!!!!!!!!,1
Smells good. Tried on both my dogs and didn't work at all.,0
Loved this dog pen. Was wonderful for my little Chihuahua had all of her things in there and she enjoyed the space it had for her. Great designs too.,1
"Very cheaply made
What do you expect for the price so I should not be so surprised
Pass on this bed",0
"Purchased this bed for our senior Lab/Dalmatian mix. She's about 80 lbs. I had an old denim dog bed cover to put over this bed to make it easier to keep clean, this way I can simply slip off the outer cover and wash it instead of having to remove the stuffing on this one. Sally fit perfectly in the large size bed and seems to like it. The bed appears to be very good quality.  We did buy extra upholstery foam and stuff it under the included cushion to make it even higher and softer for her. Two photos show the bed with and without the extra 4 inches of foam.

Good price. Quality product.,1
Zero doesnt even deserve a star.  I think this must be a fake.  It really didn't do anything.  What a waiste or money.  Im super disappointed.  Im going to try the chews,0
Goldfish love it!,1
My cat would not eat them. Even the dog wouldn't :( and she eats everything.,0
It killed the fleas. Now our dog can use the yard in peace.,1
"Read carefully. It's just one bone despite the pictures showing multiple bones and using the word ""chews"" instead of chew. Feel a little deceived",0
"These bowls are perfect for feeding large litters of puppies.  Heaven sent, actually and the babies cannot step in it or sleep in it like they do ordinary bowls. As an AKC Breeder of fine Malamutes I highly recommend these.",1
Not one of my three little pigs ( guinea) will even take a taste.  They don't like FLOUR!!,0
"My dog's absolutely love this food!  I tried giving them two other brands of food - just to test how much they love Freshpet - and they somewhat ate it because they were hungry but once I gave them this one, they lick their bowls clean!!  I'm super happy with this food. My babies only deserve the best!!",1
"I think it was okay, she was on meds as well.",1
my dog has become addicted to these flying type toyz tennis ballz are a  farsecond any more..,1
EXcellent protein level and my 4 cats love it.,1
"Not sure what the point of a stretchy harness is...needs to be far more durable for the size it is. Cool coloring, but it ripped after 2 weeks of daily use. My dog is not a puller and I am disappointed in Puppia. Second one in a row that's done this.

Will be moving on to a different product.",0
My dog goes crazy for these,1
Great product for a great price,1
Too small. Poor quality,0
Worst pads ever!!!!,0
I shipped my dog from Missouri to Germany. This crate was amazing. It arrived within 2 days (prime membership). I had to order the metal screws in addition because this crate comes with plastic ones. My dog made it safe to Germany unaccompanied through United Airlines.,1
"I have had this stroller for a littler over a year, and I have had to re-stitch almost every seam. The zippers are now starting to slip, and don't both putting anything in the bottom basket - the straps holding it on will break if you put anything that weighs more than a pound. My dog only weighs 7 pounds, so I can only imagine the product fails even more with a bigger dog.",0
Like these.. My cat gets them every day,1
stinky tasty treat and I throw it.,0
my dog's favorite,1
"I bought this at a pet store for a litter of 3 week old puppies just starting to teeth. They didn't want anything to do with it, but unfortunately, I walked in on the mother eating it. It felt too hard for her to do be able to do that, but she ate one of the corners off and swallowed it. She's a Pomeranian, so not very  big. Granted, this wasn't made for an adult dog, but still, I don't think it should have been that easy for a small dog to tear up. If she could, so could the puppies in another week. I wasn't surprised to see all the reviews here stating the same thing. I highly recommend against this product. Nylabone has a bad reputation and it's been decades since I bought one for a puppy. I can't believe they're still in business and wish I'd saved my $5, and hoping I don't end up with a large vet bill.",0
"Avoid at all costs!!! I used this on a very small spot of my newly purchased area rug that my cat peed on. The smell is horrible!!! I've used a mixture of peroxide and baking soda to get rid of the smell, as well as vinegar spray, and also a lot of sprinkled baking powder left for hours and vacuumed up. Nothing I have done will rid the most horrible smell of this product from my brand new rug. I even ended up trying to get it steam cleaned by Stanley Steamer and it still smells... I am beyond upset and need to throw the rug away now. Avoid this product at all costs!!!",0
Came as predicted on time,1
If I could give less then 1 star I would!!! This bed almost killed my dog! Yes its cute and its a good idea but it is not safe. She chewed it up and two huge pieces of the foam were lodged in her intestines! She has been in the hospital now for 4 days hooked to IVs due to dehydration. So now $3000 later theres still a possibility that she could not make it. DO NOT BUY THIS BED !!!,0
"This is cute and fun, but the zipper to the door broke within two weeks, leaving it unusable. I am disappointed.",0
"Our cat was having lots of problems with other brands of dry food.  Cleaning up the puke from multiple places every day gets old really fast.  She has had no problems with this food, and has been on it for about 6 months now.  She likes it, plus no puke so this one is a winner.",1
Cheap junk,0
Very good idea but they are too tall and can't be attached tightly enough at the base to take the scratching and the 2 I bought have come apart. We are trying to figure out how to put them back together so they will be sturdier than the staples that were holding them together. Thought it would save my new leather couch corners but not when they are laying in 2 pieces.,0
none of the sizes matched that I ordered... some large ...then med and small...they were very loose cheaply made... I tried to add Velcro to the 1 out of 6 that actually came close to the small size but wow no..... there is nothing to them it's VERY VERY think....we even used it with a poise pad and I accident and it was soaked... Much better on the market.....,0
"The turnout blanket only lasted about one week,before it started to unravel at one of the seams. Once it unraveled, it split in another direction.
I would not recommend this product.",0
"The bed arrived soiled, it is hard and heats to a temperature just slightly warmer than room temperature. Neither my cat nor I were impressed. The icing on the cake is, the wrong packing slip came with the shipment and Petco has yet to reply to my request for help in returning it.",0
Cats did not like it,0
Good price,1
"Good size, simple and well-made.",1
"I have two dogs: a 10 year old boxer mix & a 4 year old terrier.  The terrier can eat anything, but the boxer is the source of our dog food woes.

My boxer mix has had a sensitive stomach all her life and she is also easily agitated (observant, smart and demanding).  Whenever she was upset or given table scraps, she would throw up.  Even just seeing evidence that we would be leaving the house would make her throw up.  If she thought it was time to eat and we weren't feeding her, she would throw up.  We stopped giving her any scraps and got an automatic food dispenser for the cat so the noise it makes acts as an indicator for eating time.  This helped a lot with the puking.  But still she would throw up every few days.  The vet wasn't able to find anything wrong and suggested probiotics and a special diet.

Rather than mainstream brands, we started with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Choice-Adult-Chicken-Whole-Brown-Rice-and-Oatmeal-Formula-Dog-Food-30-Pound-bag/dp/B006WYUCV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Choice Adult Chicken, Whole Brown Rice, and Oatmeal Formula, Dog Food, 30-Pound bag</a>' and this helped a lot.  It has no chicken by-product or corn and even made her poopies more firm and regular.  I also liked that it was made in America.  She still puked when terribly upset (by her definition) but with yogurt every few days, it was controllable.

Seven months ago, we switched both dogs to Wellness.  The food is offered with a Subscribe and Save discount through Amazon and that brought the price of Wellness down to even cheaper than Nutro.  It is an absolute life saver having the bags delivered to our door so I wouldn't have to go to Petsmart every month and carry a 30 lb bag.  We have two bags delivered every two months and its really nice to never have to worry about running out of food.  We actually have a good half month stockpiled in the basement.

This food is great for my boxer's sensitive stomach.  I have noticed my boxer throwing up even less, now it is barely a once a month occurrence and usually only happens if her life is totally thrown out of balance.  We have seen the same effect with her poopies.  They are firm and regular (very easy to clean up and doesn't fall apart when I use the pooper scooper).

This food also has their coats looking great (even better than Nutro).  The boxer has had dry skin issues in the past (Minnesota winters are incredibly dry).  I used to add oil to her food with the Nutro but with the Wellness dog food I haven't seen any dry skin.  When we switched to Wellness, my terrier had a skin irritation she had picked up from a kennel stay over a year ago.  We had almost settled on it being a permanent marking given that she is white; it was very obvious.  The issue had since cleared and her coat looks great.  You can't even tell anything was ever wrong, amazing considering that her white, fluffy coat shows absolutely everything.  This could have been due to time alone, but I think the quality of food has helped.

The only reason I didn't give this food five stars was because it smells.  Awful.  It makes their breath smell bad too.  They love it but  then they aren't picky eaters by any means; they might even like the smell.  I would readily recommend this brand of dog food, but suggest to maybe experiment with the other flavors unless a sensitive stomach is truly your dog's issue.  The whole 'dog feeding room' smells like fish because of the food.",1

"I received my scooper a few days ago and after purchasing many, many litter scoopers over the years in the hopes of find the ""perfect"" one, I finally have! The iPrimio sifter does exactly what it says - no more shaking to separate litter from clumps, and nothing has stuck to it at all. I love not having to see hardened litter and other matter stuck all over the scooper. The iPrimio scooper is a dream!",1
"All of the comments and questions answered two bags.

ITS ONLY ONE. Not two bags

"I bought this one and the blue one. the blue ones seem to be a lot brighter, this one was very dim. Almost not worth putting in my fish tank. Made couldn't hardly tell it was on unless I turned off my main light",0
I managed  to put it together but I am not pleased with it. It is cheap and flimsy. I am going to try to send it back as it does not help my little JellyBean at all.,0
Better performance than expected. Assembly took 30 seconds with clearly written instructions included in package. Jaws are capable of handling even the waste of an English bulldog. Clean no mess bags make it great for picking up an easy to discard. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a large breed dog or puppy you need to pick up after.,1
Complete garbage I returned it after the first day. I bought the extra large one and my giant schnauzer had it off in less than 10 seconds,0

Works great at keeping food fresh.,1
Terrible Product Made My Dog Sick,0
My animals wouldn't drink it with the filter,0
This product is absolutely wonderful! Super easy to use and got my result back within the time they advertised. Not only did it test my dogs breeds but this tests for the MDR-1 mutation.  I would recommend this to everyone!,1
Excellent.....I have ordered the product before so I knew exactly what it would do.,1
The boot hooks are not the same as in the picture. I purchased these because of the metal wrapping around the handle. When they arrived the metal is just stuck up in the handle. This style has never lasted long in the past.,0
Fits my 2016 Ford Explorer great. My only complaint is that it could use better securments on the sides. It has enough fabric to cover my bumper when loading and unloading.,1

Seems to work well.,1
dog likes it,1
"These are great for feeding small fish and corals, but please note: it is in a liquid form and you will probably have to find some way to freeze it before it spoils. I would recommend mini ice cube trays or just flat packing it in a ziploc bag. I would have preferred a dried product, but the actual quality may be worth the extra effort.",1
My boys love these. They are s but pricey but they are all natural. And they are made here!,1
"Doesn't fit right, too much velcro and fits like a soft and box around the dog's head. Returned same day.",0
"This is an excellent product idea and design.  Working well with my 4 chickens and didn't take them long at all to figure out the food is now there even though I did not remove the coop attached feed trough as I want to have it in place for the scraps and greens I give them on occasion. I did as the paperwork advised and filled and reached in and pulled some feed onto the lip of the feeder--did this two or three times then noted the girls sticking their heads in to feed on their own.  :)  In the past when I've needed to be away a few days my housemate has forgotten to feed them which made me feel guilty and sad for the chickens.  :(  I Love that this will now be available able to feed the girls over a period of a few days if I'm away as a backup in case my housemate forgets!! YAY! :D
 THANK YOU!",1
"I think it is depending on your cat, and mine just does not want to poop on the plate with a hole where she can see the water beneath. So that she chose to use my trash can instead....poor me. She always pushed all of the litter on the plate into the toilet. I gave up! It is such a mess.",0
"This is listed as a Large feeder, but is false advertising. It is the same measurement as the small feeder, they just included the cardboard hanger/info on their measurement. It is a very small size, never used it for our guinea pigs because it doesnt hold much. I didn't have the energy to return it, so it sits in the garage. Would never buy from them again.",0
"The thunder shirt looks nice and fits well.  It just hasn't worked for my dogs severe anxiety and fear of rain, thunder. :(",0
"I have been searching forever for single elevated dog bowls, and I finally took a chance on the 7"" and 12"" feeders from NMN for my dogs...and it paid off!  These stands are very sturdy, stylish, and affordable; they will last a long, long time.  Not only is the quality great, but so is the company.  My order arrived very quickly - much sooner than expected, in fact.  I am very pleased overall with my purchase, and would most definitely order from NMN Products again.",1
Crabbies love it !,1
"My dog likes this, but not as well as the grilled chicken and steak combo.",1
"I'm not happy with this fountain. I've had it for barely a year and a half and it has been a pain to deal with. You have to take it apart and clean it thoroughly every week. If you don't, you will get a build up of yellow slime, and the fountain will leak all over the floor. Even with regular cleanings, there are now yellow stains in the bowl along where the edge of the water is that won't come off, and it's pretty unattractive. This week the fountain started leaking like crazy, and after numerous attempts to take it apart and clean it thoroughly, it will not stop leaking. I guess I have to replace it now. I'm pretty unhappy about this. My last pet fountain I had lasted for YEARS, and it never leaked. This fountain should have lasted more than a year and a half, and it shouldn't have spent half of its life leaking all over my floor. I would not recommend this product at all.",0
perfect replacement,1
the large size was too small for my ten lb cat!,0
I love the way these bones hold up they are worth the extra money for the durability,1
"People love it, and Maisy the dog loves wearing it. Had one that lasted over a year .It looked ragged, but for < $10 bought another one.",1

Thought maybe it was a defective one, so ordered a new one for him from amazon and the same thing happened! Disappointed because he really seems to love it when it works :(",0
My vet recommends this so I use it.  Dogs also get acupuncture and they are old but move comfortably even with  arthritis.  How much is from the Cetyl M I don't know.  But the dogs are good so l keep buying.,1

"We got the 2 pack because we needed one for each of our 2 dogs.  Got tired of the cheap 400 series stainless that rusts, was actually looking for something that was 316 stainless, but these 304 are all I could find.  Wok well, we even painted the dogs names on them....",1
:),1
"I brought this before and it cost me just over 20 dollars.  Now Amazon has it for 7 dollars more.

Like the other reviewer, I used to shop at Amazon for decent prices.  Now I'll avoid and pay a little extra (23 dollars) from my local brick and motar store.",0
"I was using these on my cat, who obviously does not like baths. They left him looking nice and soft, BUT he started getting these raw, red, scabby spots on his belly. He would lick at them, making them worse. I took my cat to the vet and he explained that he was having an allergic reaction to something (we weren't sure what it was). To get rid of the hurt spots, my cat got a steroid shot and a few days later, the spot was gone. I continued using these wipes, and my cat kept having this allergic reaction every month or two and I kept having to take him to the vet to get the steroid shots (which was about $95 each time!). I finally connected the dots and realized that these wipes might have been the thing making my cat get these spots. I stopped using them (it's been about 3 months now) and he hasn't gotten the allergy spots on his belly since! Just a heads up for anyone who might be experiencing the same thing!",0
Don't waste your money. It does not fit any of my faucets. Way overpriced. The idea of buying online is convenience. It will not be convenience anymore with all the hassle of repacking and sending it back. I posted two pictures of the shower head and you will see the actual opening size. Very disappointed with this product.,0
"This pump has a manufacture defect with the right side bearing loose for the bio-wheel on the right side,causing the wheel not to rotate.",0
"It's smaller than I expected but it's not a problem for me since I have robo dwarf hamsters.
But it may be problematic for people with syrian hamsters or anything bigger like chinchillas.
My hamsters haven't been in yet but I'm hoping they'll start using the sand bath.
I love that it has ears and since it's glazed I'm thinking it's an easy and quick clean up",1
"I have a 65 lbs. american staffordshire terrier who is a big chewer and he had this toy destroyed and completely in pieces within 30 minutes. He had pieces everywhere, it is easy to rip. Once it has a piece broken, it just comes apart from there. I could even pull off pieces with no problem. Really disappointing.",0
This was good as a liner pad for my dogs cage. The size was spot on. I was expecting that it would be a bit more plush (thicker) because it was quite thin. I was going for a comfy alternative so my dog didn't want to always opt to hang out on my bed. This didn't do the trick but it works for the cage so I'll keep it.,1
"This is the second open air screen cage I have bought.  I already have the 24x24x48 by the same maker.  Despite it seeming a bit flimsy, it works great.  The downfall is there is no where to hook anything.  You have to attach stuff right to the screen.  I use the tiny zip ties which just fit if you make the screen hole a little larger.  Be careful though as the screening breaks easily if you push too hard.  I have placed sticks etc right up agains the screen and so far none have broken through so it's sturdy enough if you are careful.  You can sit the lighting fixures right on top and it holds up well.  I have a gallon milk jug that I cleaned out well and filled half way with water that I use for a dripper.  This sits on the top of the cage and I have had no problems with it or the stick that is next to it that actually touches the top of the screened cage.  It has not poked through at all.  So, you can figure out how to hang stuff if you are creative.  Oh, bread ties that are coated in plastic work great too for attaching stuff.  The doors have very tiny cracks around them and none of my live feeders have escaped.  I have read issues with this from other posts and I would reocommend returning it if the space around the doors is big enough for feeders to escape.  I would recommend this item.  FYI my veiled chameleon loves it!",1
Kept my dog warm this winter in his crate.,1
"This was the second automatic feeder we tried, and it works exactly as described.  We did have to jury-rig it a little bit on the back since we have a hood but wanted it attached to the tank, but it's been working like a charm for two months and the fish all seem fat and happy!",1
"Bought this to treat cat urine stains on my carpet based on good reviews. Not only did it NOT remove the stains, it actually made them WORSE! It intensified the stains turning them almost orange. As it combined with the cat urine on the carpet it then gave off a nasty, funky odor. I simply cannot fathom how this garbage managed to get so many good reviews. While I don't know if any product truly works to remove urine stains effectively from carpet, all I can share is that this stuff absolutely does not!!!",0

I am beyond disappointed and frustrated with this product.  I put this product on our 5-month-old Doberman's collar this past Saturday and it was no where to be seen after yesterday's (Monday) evening walk ~ two days later.  Not only did we lose the Rubit but also our puppy's name tag and rabies tag.  This product is costing us money as we now have to replace his name tag and rabies tag.  Don't waste your money on this inferior product unless you want to lose it and your pet's tag(s).,0
"update- stopped working, piece of junk...",0
We have always clipped our dogs nails and have had several pairs of this style. These have been my favorite and that because they are way sharper than others. We have big dogs and some clippers I would have to really work to cut them. And that's not always easy when you have a dog who doesn't like it in the first place. Otherwise they are typical with how they work and the grip. I would recommend them to others as well as reorder when we need a new pair.,1
"I would strongly advise against buying this litter.  There is something very oily about it, so when your hand is on the litter liner at the side while trying to scoop (which it pretty much has to be, because the clumps really stick to the liner and you have to pull at the liner to remove them), your hands come away so oily and greasy that you have to immediately wash them.  I've never had that happen with any other brand.",0
"I was disappointed that the edges were not clear, around the fishes mouth they look sanded.
However, the tail and fin details are very pretty.",0
"Our cats love this food, it maintains their weight well, and the price is excellent compared to local stores and the veterinarian.",1
"We tried this product and our Mini Schnauzer just loved the entire Happy Hips line. You really get the best value here. I've checked all our Feed Stores in the area and could not find a lower price. We even subscribed to the ""Auto Ship"" and it comes to our door automatically ever 60 days. Gotta love it!",1
Great light had it for about 6 months and it works great on my 55 gallon very bright and clear. The timer also comes in very handy.,1
"We bought the 36"" for our two 9 lb Maltese for travel. They fit perfectly in it. Sturdy. Easy set-up and fold down. Nice size for hotel room. We first set it up in our family room so they could climb in and out of it as they wanted so they didn't get anxious and try to chew their way out of it when zipped in. Seems to have worked because they settle right down when we put them to bed and zip them in at night when traveling.",1
"Did not work well for hiding a pill for my cat. They are too big for my cat to swallow without chewing, so the pill comes out, the cat tastes it, spits it out, and runs away. I even tried breaking the pocket into quarters and molding one quarter around the pill. But the gummy consistency still had my cat chewing at it, which defeats the purpose as the taste of the pill leaks out. I also tried the Tomlyn Pill-Masker at the same time, and it works like a charm. If these don't work for you and your cat, try another product.",0
Please do not use this product on your pet.  I have two small breed dogs that I used this product on.  One had a terrible hot spot as a result of using it.  He knawed his leg until it bled and my other dog was lethargic and vomiting as a result.  I thought I was saving money and helping my pets but I only ended up hurting them and had a huge vet bill as a result.  Any Hartz or zodiac products or any of these types of products will harm your pet.,0

I have 3 pitbulls.  They sit on the cover without sliding.  One of the dogs sheds like crazy.  It takes two washes to get the hair out but the cover is holding up well.  Sometimes we take the dogs off-roading and the hammock part comes in handy to help give them a little more stability.,1
"The only complaint is that the opening doesn't really stay open like it shows in the picture. It just lays flat, so I have to lift it open for her to get in. Once in a while she will be able to burrow herself in. My dog is 45 lbs and the large is perfect size.",1
"I adopted two miniature poodles a year ago. They are now 10 years old. When we got them, Spike weighed a whopping 22 pounds (overweight), and Buffy only weighed 13 pounds. She started having terrible diarrhea outside and in the house immediately. Feeding her the best foods made no difference. I took her back to the vet and he did blood work, and said she had IBS. He put her on steroids, and there was improvement.
I know the benefits of probiotics, so I bought a jar of Pet Ultimate based on the number of 5 Star reviews. In about a week, she improved drastically! There is no doubt in my mind that the probiotics are making a real difference along with her steroids. Every time I run out, she gets terrible diarrhea within days. It clears up within a week after she is back on it. I also give it to Spike because it keeps him very regular.
This has been a real life saver for us. The steroids work, but Pet Ultimates provides a needed boost for her compromised little body. A little over a year since we got them, she weighs 17 pounds as does Spike. She has plenty of energy and is a very happy little dog!",1
"I actually use these in front of my cat boxes instead of litter mats, because I can just toss them.  I never realized this before, but I don't think cats really like litter...so I have inadvertantly 'paper trained' them with these.  Apparently they prefer to pee on the pads as opposed to in the litter.  It keeps the litter and the boxes cleaner, catches litter before it's tracked all over the house and I can just fold and toss the pads.  Oddly, they don't scratch them to shreds as one might expect.",1
"I have a 220lb mastiff.  All dogs smell and the bigger the dog the harder it is to control.  I know it is for cats but I use it for my dog because I figure it probably is stronger if it gets rid of odors from cats spraying.  I use daily on his ""bed"" in our living room and the carpet near it.  It does the trick.  I also does not have a strong lingering smell.  I highly recommend!",1
"I ordered this Fortress Steel Cat Tree for 39.00 and that is NOT WHAT I RECEIVED! Instead, they sent me a Scratch Ramp that was 23.83, and STILL charged me the 39.00! And on top of all that mess, they did not send me a receipt, or a return label, so I had to request one. After printing a return label they sent me, they gave me only 2 days to get the item back to them or my money would not be refunded. Hence, didn't have time to send it back to them, so no refund. Stuck with this piece of crap. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.",0
"I figured the higher price was justified since I maintain great physical health eating Paleo with no grains or art. ingredients, so it made sense purely carnivorous cats would also benefit. Of our three cats, two wouldn't touch it. In a mix with their old food, they literally ate around it. The third one, whom I believe would eat cardboard if it had a little chicken broth on it, took to it. One month later, he was constantly throwing up and dropped about a half pound. Vet tests confirmed no major disorders so vet told me to change back to old food, Iams. He has since regained his weight and we are not cleaning up vomit from area rugs three times per day.",0

"I have purchased antlers for my dogs before, and have found them to be long lasting and worth the money.  I purchased two of these; a medium and a large.  The medium was a perfect size for my 40 pound dog.  Once she gets something, she takes it with her everywhere; the other dog is the same way with her chew toys.  I got a jumbo for the larger dog from the same manufacturer.  The medium splintered into little pieces after about an hour; my dogs are NOT aggressive chewers; they just chew.  The jumbo is now a little nub after about four days.  The one I bought last week that was more than these two combined is in the same shape it was when it got here, which I guess is a lesson to me, since the smaller dog has chewed on it since the other one disintegrated.  If you have a toothless poodle, then these are worth your money.  If your dog has teeth....spend a little more.  You'll be glad you did.",0

"I've used GNC's Calming formula chewable tablets before with excellent results and thought these would be similar since I couldn't find the chewable tablets anywhere. They were so sticky that my dogs couldn't break them up or swallow them - they kept getting stuck in their teeth. My pups love sticky peanut butter but they hated these (the flavor must have also been modified). Bottom line: These can't work because the dogs couldn't swallow them - yes, they were that sticky.

After their bath and blow dry their ""cuddle factor"" is over the top.
Up date...... Jar of conditioner became all greasy and turned a dark brown. Gross. I contacted rep from Happy Tails and was told that there is only a two year shelf life and to throw it away. She added that the jar that I got was probably old. She did not offer to replace or refund. I see no expire date on label. So there is no way to know how old it is when it is purchased.

Great collar.,1
I have purchased these bags before about 1 1/2 years ago and they have lasted that long (supply wise)!  I have never had a tear or accident when using (this means a lot to me as I am a germafobe).  They are freshly scented too which masks the scent of the dog poo!  I would definitely recommend for small or large dogs - they appear to be ample.  I have a small dog and sometimes he poos twice on a walk and there is enough room to accommodate both piles so I'm sure they would work for a large dog single pile.,1

I cannot figure out why the pet stores don't carry this toy along with the different attachments. Instead they carry the stuff that cats don't play with. The cat guy recommends this toy and I am sure to recommend to my friends who have cats also. Certainly I have already done so to my daughter who also owns a cat and she too loved it.

Waste of money.  Cannot read the words.,0
nice sturdy comb,1
Good stuff,1
"My dog has destroyed 2 of these. It tears really easily. He loves the bed, for the week that it lasts.",0
Got a cat? This works!  He can now go with you in his own playpen.,1
Great!!!,1
"Maybe I just got too hyped up for this brush from the other product reviews. I have a $7 rake from PetSmart that pulls out the dregs of my dog's undercoat, and we always have a nice pile after a 15-minute brushing session. I used this Newstyle brush on him and we barely got a few wisps. I think the teeth are too far apart to effectively pull out hair from a dense undercoat and topcoat.

If your pet has loooong hair, this may be useful since there's minimal risk of snagging on tangles. But if your dog/cat has shorter hair and a dense undercoat, I'd pick up a curved rake.

I've attached an image of a brush that looks similar to the $7 brush I have. Notice how the teeth are curved; the one I have at home has the teeth even closer together.",0
good door. but it is single payne glass. which makes it a bad deal for very cold ereas. like chicago to much icing thry door.but in other areas I don't see why this would not work great.other then that it is a great door easy to install. well constructed.,1
"I was optimistic for a couple of days, then he just ripped it off. Straps are way too thin and latches are pretty cheap for a $60 harness.",0
I'm not comfortable giving my pet artificial sweeteners long term and should've looked at the ingredients prior to purchasing. A similar product that comes in a pump is made with fish oil and is the one I was looking for.,0
The charging port broke on the third use.,0
These bulbs last for 30 days running 12 hours per day .... very expensive for the limited life span,0
Very good.,1
"Pretty terrible toy all around. After a few minutes of play it starts running slower... and slower... and slower.... and if your cat is energetic at all, it never moves fast enough to be real enticing anyway. You have to have the remote pointed RIGHT at it for it to work, and it runs really poorly and slowly on carpet. My cat found it completely uninteresting, which isn't necessarily the fault of the toy, but overall it's just real unimpressive. Supposedly it'll run about 15 min before needing a recharge, but my experience was closer to 5 min, before it slows too much to be worth playing with. After trying it out several times with a few recharges, it will hardly run at all even directly after a recharge. Thankfully I bought this on clearance at Target so I'm only out $5, but this toy becomes unplayable so quickly I wish I'd spent the money on a Starbucks instead. That would have also been a fleeting experience but at least more satisfying. :D",0
"This stuff works awesomely!!!  Try it, you'll love it!  I've used it for years and it has become a little more price but works great!",1
Good koi food for cold weather transition.,1
Better than the Halti because you can adjust it better,1
"Easy to feed, clean-up and the best thing is it's loved by my Aussie, as an alternative to always feeding raw.......",1
"Looks like a great product , but the sizing is way off. I bought a large for my 80lb lab mix. It was way too small. He probably would need an XXL , but they don't have that size. We are donating to our local shelter. The sizes only fit probably 50lb dogs and below. I was wondering why the product was so cheap. I found out when I tried to fit it on my dog.",0
Couldn't get it to work and got busy forgot to return and missed the return date by 1 day.,0
"Love these collars, they don't shread like nylon collars.  We rescue the strays, several have been dumped but also ferals.  Several have become friendly so we have collard them.  But since they stray they will lose their collars, we take off the bells and don't put rabies tags on.  I take craft paint and paint a light base of color on them, then use permanent marker and write their name and our phone # on them.  Couldn't do that on woven nylon.  Also started Super Gluing the break away clip together.  We leave the collars loose enough to slide over head if need be.  And we do locate some of them in that condition when they lose them.  The fabric is so perfect for keeping track of the minions.",1
Works great and very helpful with grooming my Morkie!,1
"This worked great on my dogs nails which are thick,",1
Used it for my dog and my cats. Didn't help.,0
Very good the product works me correctly and still excellent price !!!,1
junk cheap kills your arm and shoulders was a huge waste of money ...... wouldn't recommend ...throw it in trash,0
"Did not come as shown or stated. This clearly stated for dogs less than 50 lbs in the picture and in type, and I specifically bought it for that reason because my dog is less than 20 lbs. It came in an entirely different package and is for dogs less than 100 lbs. The clip to attached it to my dogs collar is way to heavy for my small dog. I now have to go out and buy a different tie out for her that won't pull her neck to the ground and rig it to the trolley, just to avoid the hassle of returning and trying to get the right one. I wish I had gone to my local pet store instead, then I wouldn't have had to wait the 2 day shipping and all this extra hassle this has given me.",0
Instruction booklet was so hard to read (tiny print) therefore hard to understand and since this is a very important training tool only to use correctly I would not recommend this product to anyone.,0
"We have used these for several years for our cat and we really like them...as much as you can really like a litter box... We have one smallish, inside/outside, female cat, so in months when she is outside a lot one box can last us a couple of months. We do not put the WonderBox inside of another litter box and we rarely notice any odor. They are well made, sturdy, convenient and it's always nice to put out a fresh litter box. We always buy the 3-pack from Amazon and have never been disappointed!",1
Its way too small! I have a small medium dog and it won't even fit around his head!,0
ok for the price,1
This needed to come with instructions!  Have yet to figure out how to use it!  Have resorted back to my old method of using one of my neck scares to hold up my pooch's reared to groom.  Wast of money for me.,0
Decent product,0
"This stuff is a joke. I used it with both of my dogs. The first day, even with only using HALF of the suggested amount, one dog vomited within a few minutes. After trying for a week, BOTH of my dogs have green, sloppy poo. They had not had these symptoms prior. I  have AKC labrador dogs and feed them only premium dog food. I believe this stuff is a joke, and this company is taking good money for a garbage product.",0
Well made.  Sturdy.  Nice color selection.  Easy to put on the dog.,1
"So this product is ""designed for dogs who love to tug and shake"", this toy lasted 2 weeks at best!  My pooch is a 45lbs dog and LOVES to tug on toys.  He absolutely loved this toy, but sadly for him, it tore apart fairly easy, which is odd given KONG's stellar reputation for being durable and strong.  Not for this toy.  It tore apart in several different places; the tail came off the within the first 3 days he had it, the arms slide back and forth and stitching came undone quickly, legs also slide back and forth and stitching also came undone quick....  BOOOO!!!",0
Way too small,0
I love these clippers! so easy to use. best nail trimmers i've used on my cats so far. I don't think I will ever use any other brand again because these are just perfect.,1
"I purchased two of these gates, and both arrived broken.  Each gate had two pickets that had broken off completely.  I attribute the problem to poor manufacturer packaging and the flimsiness of the gate itself.  The material that the gates are made of looks more like compressed cardboard than a wood composite.  Very disappointing!  These gates would have been cute and appropriate, if they weren't flimsy and broken.",0
"This collar deflated with in minutes of being on my dog. Even with repeated attempts, it would only stay inflated for a small amount of time. It also did not stop him from reaching his incision after being just neutered. This is not an alternative for a cone, this is a neck pillow.",0
The dogs don't love the taste. Not sure what the taste is but the dogs don't really love it. The toothbrush is silicon so thats an interesting feeling for them. I feel like a regular toothbrush would work better.,0
"Outstanding Cat Post. I have 5 cats and they love to scratch. This has been used for a year and it is in new shape still. It is strong, sturdy, tall and nice to look at. I am ordering more. Called the company to get some info and they are extremely nice. BUY THIS! You  will be so happy you did. I love that the top part comes off for a bed.",1
"It took my cat only a few minutes to get accustomed to it, but he loves it. It is very easy to clean. I clean it about twice a week since our house is rather dusty and we have a dog as well (she does not drink from the fountain though), so pet hair is all over. I haven't had any issues with the motor or with the filters or anything. It is very, very quiet with just the occasional tinkling of the water trickling into the basin, but that's only occasionally and I don't find it annoying or loud. I keep the water level very high to ensure the motor doesn't get loud from also taking in air with the water. My cat drinks out of both the basin and where the water bubbles up, but he seems to prefer the bubbling bit the most. I set the flow on the next highest speed rather than the highest one and it's works perfectly. Very pleased with this fountain.",1
Great Dane puppy loves it:),1
"Neither cat would eat them, one tried to cover it up like you know what.",0
"While visiting my buddy, he gave our large 105lb Collie Hops one of these and he loved it! He got about 45 minutes of delight chewing this thing up. I ordered me this pack the next week, and Hops loved it!",1
This was a request from my designated charity thru Amazon Smile.  The charity is a cat rescue organization.  They always are in need of litter.,1
Easy to refill and our animals love it. Very happy with this purchase.,1
Since I received I love it. Great product,1
"Receiver stopped working after 3 months. Won't charge, won't reset.",0
My trainer suggested we start brushing our dog's teeth. They like the flavor of the tooth paste and are getting used to this process. The tube is quite large and will last a good long time.,1
"2 months and stitching has frayed, no longer able to use.",0
Works like a champ,1
Had this for about 3 months and broke. Would have taken a photo but the joints and hinges were so badly ripped out of the wood that I don't think it would have done justice. Very disappointed and not worth the money.,0

"They basically stayed together and didn't give the impression of real goldfish. Of course, what was I expecting?  Sorry I bought them.",0
"I ordered an XXL hoping it would fit my German Shepherd, but it way to small, its more like size large.  Not worth the time or effort to send it back.",0
I bought this for my little chi mix and she loves them. This size is just a tad too big for her so we purchased another one that was extra small. She carries these everywhere and likes to squeak them. Not once has she got the squeaker out but she isn't really trying.,1
"Great cage for my 1 year old chinchilla. Came in the mail quick, went to work came home and my girlfriend had it all set up perfectly. Since my chinchilla jumps like a rabid frog most of the night she seems to keep disconnecting the bottom ladder latch. My only advice would to secure the latch with a pet safe adhesive so the ladders stay in place. Enjoy this cage for any sort of medium to large pet companion they live the space.",1
We have a small cockapoo and he loves soft toys. I timed it. Five minutes and the floor was full of stuffing. The stitching was terrible. Def disappointed.,0
Expected this to clean the inside of my aquarium and was greatly disappointed. Definitely not worth the money spent or the aggravation of not receiving the first time.,0
Think I prefer the live moss ball. The fake one just doesn't work well. Shrimp don't like it. Don't think will get another one.,0
"our dog loves this food in addition to their dry food of the same flavor, chicken & sweet potato. We recently figured out that he couldn't have food with grain in it and Natural Balance products fit the bill. Concerning is the recent price increase of this product, $17.88 per case 4 weeks ago, then $20.11 and now $24.11 as of this post. that's a significant increase (23%) in a very short period of time and has a big impact on our pet food budget.",1
This is great. My dog hated using regular clippers but she doesn't mind this at all. I think she kind of likes it. Even on low speed it grinds the nails down pretty fast. I do wish it came with the smaller grinding wheels that they mention in the manual (for cats or very small dogs) but that was my fault for not researching it thoroughly enough.,1
I really liked the product until it stopped working??? I hit the reset button and the light on the collar won't come to life again. I get this on a Black Friday deal...its now January and its dead. Hmph.,0
"Love the price, will see how long they last and get back to you.",1
Both of my dogs have become sick with yeast problems since eating the most recent bag of food. They don't even want to eat it. What happened in production? They've never had this reaction before.,0
"I mix this food 50/50 by weight with Higgins Sunburst Hamster and Gerbil Food for my Syrian hamster. She loves these blocks! They are always the first things she grabs out of her bowl. I love that these blocks when mixed with the Sunburst add protein to my hamster's diet. Most commercial hamster foods are much to low in protein for hamsters, and this fixes that! This food should not be fed alone though because it would be too high in protein, and doesn't have the variety a good quality hamster seed mix does. In my opinion, mixing this with Higgins Sunburst is the best diet for a hamster!",1
arrived broken,0
"My dachshund loves this food. But what I would REALLY LOVE is if this were to become a ""subscribe and save "" item!",1
"My dog loves them, what dog wouldn't? However they smell incredibly terrible. Open the bag to give him one and you might be inclined to vomit on the floor.",0
NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE,1
"Nice rope toy, but the tassels on the end come out really easily. It was a constant mission to keep him from tearing them out and eating them. Not great for a tug toy.",0
Outstanding leash and great design.  Durable construction.  Good for large dog.,1

Very helpful at locating mystery smells and hitting them with an enzyme cleaner.,1
Never buy it again!,0
One of the stones were broke,0

"Very thin, do not absorb urine. Urine just runs off on floor. A newspaper would work better.",0
this product is ok. my cats looked at it for about 10 minutes and then nothing. some one made a lot of money off of a piece of wire and a few pieces of rolled up cardboard. price is ok. just ordered it to get ot the $35 i needed to spend to get the free shipping. I won't waste my money on this agian.,0
"My dog loves them, but in comparison to other treats, this one upsets his stomach. I can tell he really enjoys these... but I would look for something healthier than this brand.",0
My little chihuahua terrier mix (20 pounds) ate one in less than 10 minutes and threw up an hour later. I'm not saying the product is defective (totally understandable that he threw up because it's a rich treat and he ate it quickly) but I wish it lasted longer so he could proberly enjoy it and eat it correctly. This is the consistency of a snausage,0
"What dog doesn't need a treat that keeps them occupied and satisfied for awhile! The dogs love these, they chew on them much longer, and enjoy them much more than some of the other lesser quality chews available. Bag is loaded with plenty to keep my two shih tzus happy for quite some time! Will repeatedly order.",1
I just set up the skimmer and the moter keeps shutting off. I would also like to say i thought it was a hong on the back skimmer as well little diapinted. So i rearranged  my sump to fit the skimmer did all that work now the moter is not working right... i gave it a tey even tho it was not a hang on the back. Now i have to call amazone  custamer service. Ugh!!!,0
"I am a groomer and i use this quit often on short haired breeds like beagles, labs, chihuahuas, pit bulls, bulldogs. and any kind of hound. It doesn't work as well on dogs with longer hair such as golden retrievers, poms, collies, poodles, and so on.
I love this product and highly recommend it. The zoomgroom picks up loose undercoat that would be hard to get at with other brush.

I am disappointed with the people who gave this product anything lower then 4 stars. Do not rate a product low because you used it on the wrong kind of dog. It works great if you know what kind of dog it works on!",1
Works on all of our leashes and conveniently holds all types of bags. I will be ordering more of these holders,1
"My dog loves the bed but it is a piece of garbage. So poorly made and such poor quality. The zipper broke immediately, the fabric tore, the plastic tube that is supposed to maintain the ""cave"" opening came apart from the fabric. Dog did not cause any of this-no chewing, etc. A complete waste of money. Spend more, get something that lasts more than one week.",0
"we ended up using this more to walk our beagle as the cone of shame kept catching on the ground as he walked and sniffed.  We would have loved to have only used this e-collar after he was fixed, but he's long for a beagle (he's a rescue, so we're not sure he's mixed with), so he could reach around it.  Despite that, when we were around, we put this on him because he was more comfortable and we didn't have to worry about a lampshade cone of shame knocking everything in our apartment over.  We just had to make sure he was supervised while wearing it because he could reach around.  For dogs with less of a torso, it's amazing.",1
"Adhesive is not non-toxic , will not place theses on my pet .  Wasted my money !!",0
My 3 dogs do not like this food.  It has a gritty consistency that may be the problem.  They will walk away immediately when fed.,0
"Works.  Use when my dog keeps itching his ear.  Only issue is that it creates a build up and my dogs ears became matted.  Just need to brush his ears every day when using this.

Takes about a week before I see improvement; and that is the amount of time you are supposed to use.",1
"This LED dog leash is perfect for evening strolls with the pup. I've got the one in yellow and I dig it. Was that a dog pun? Anyhow, rest assured that using the Illumiseen collar will help keep you and your dog safe. Illumiseen also offers a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LED-collar/dp/B00UAINMKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LED collar</a>, so you can mix and match colors too. I've got the collar in yellow so my collar and leash match.

It's weather resistant with a comfortable soft grip handle, although I'd probably advise getting it too wet. It's resistant to water, but not waterproof, so keep that in mind and take care of the leash just like you would anything else in the rain.

When turned on, this leash is bright! It's impossible to not be seen by cars or whoever else. They'll see you and the dog coming for sure. Not only is it great for taking the dog out, but you could strap the leash to a backpack for biking or something like that. Oh, and it has a blinking mode too. Again, impossible to not be seen.

Something I'm thankful for with this leash is that it doesn't use batteries to light up the LED. It's USB rechargeable! I can even plug it into my lap top and it charges in just an hour or two. A charge will give you about 10 hours of illumination, which is a lot longer than you'd think.",1
This item lasted all of 3 minutes before my dog destroyed it.  Definite waste of money.,0
"Listed as working for my filter, these gaskets are actually have a significantly wider outside diameter, which kinda threw me. But the insdie diameter is the same, so they fit and seem to not leak so far.",1

"It's a great collar for the price!! I really love it so far and haven't had to use the shock function. The vibrate function on it is strong enough that it draws my dogs attention away from most things.

"We vacation in a community that includes cottages that are close to each other.  Our Goldendoodle barked at people walking by, close or far. After 4 seasons of this behavior, trying citronella collars, shaking pennies in a can, and all other tricks, I stumbled on this product.  After 1 spray, she was Leary of me just showing her the spray. The sound startles her. Now if she does get a bark out, it is one! I quickly grabbed a can for each room, and for 3 other houses she visits.",1

"The life jacket fit and looked great on my pup. However, after our first trip, I put the jacket in the wash and the all of the straps ripped off. I did not dry the jacket - this all happened with one wash. Decent jacket if you are not looking to ever wash it. Also, the jacket was very stained and did not improve after the wash.",0

Great if you want it to work for only 3 months. Do not buy this! Others have had the same issue,0
My cats love it. I thought it was a great price for a quality cat food.,1
"Very soft and stays close to our dogs body, she is short but her body is long and the coat covers her really well. Looks great wash after wash.  She actually has 2 of these coats.  Love this for her.",1
"I purchased this with big hopes for a simpler solution to kitty litter. Unfortunately, the product's did not live up to my hopes. First, it was unable to control poop-related odors. I work all day and would have to come home to a smelly house. The system did very little in the way of odor control.

Another issues was with my kitten's non-solid poop, which would soil tons of pellets at once and force me to go through rather expensive bags of pellets very quickly.

In the end, I was forced to return to normal litter. I have a new-found appreciation for clumping litter. Thank you, Tidy Cats.

PROS
Didn't track through the house
Pee went right through
Kitties didn't seem to mind

CONS
Lack of odor control
Expensive pellets
Can't handle kitty diarrhea",0
"I like this item, I have really seen an improvment in my dog's barking.  However one thing I did not like is the fact that if you leave it on in the house, it squirts citronella all over the house.",1

Didn't pass the cat test.  None of my 4 cats like it.  They checked it out when I first set it up and haven't been back in the weeks since.  I think they were put off by the crinkly sound it made when they walked inside the nesting areas.  I had taped together all stress points using black gorilla tape so there wouldn't be any wobbling or separation at the joints.  The cats seemed secure walking on it put recoiled when they heard the crinkly noise of the plastic/vinyl.  I've dismantled it and will try to give it away.,0
Wonderful clean fragrance.  My favorite along with the mint ones!!!,1
Lasted 4 minutes. It is not tough or durable. I would not recommend it at all.,0
Worked great for my dog. She had black tar in ear I would clean it out and a day or two it would come back. Two weeks of using this product and its all gone!,1

You may as well wave your hands over your pet and wish them away because you'll get the same results. Fleas on your dogs, in your carpet and in your beds. Something I never had with Frontline! All they have to say is it killed 1 flea to say it worked and I'm willing to bet that 1 flea died of old age, not this stuff!",0

"This is the 2nd bottle I've received; I threw out the first bottle after receiving it unsealed & contacting Amazon which refunded my purchase price.  I was thinking/hoping that it was an isolated incident that the first bottle wasn't sealed, but obviously not. There is, in fact, a foil seal inside the lid, but it is attached to the lid & not to the bottle.  I'm expecting the bottle to be sealed like vitamins, supplements, or even most spices in a jar. I'm hesitant to use this for my cats since it is a food product & without it being sealed, I have no way of knowing if it's been tampered with & is safe or not.  I have not used it.  I really hate contacting Amazon again but I may have to or just throw the bottle away like I did the last one & be out my purchase price.",0

"Cute hanger to hold leashes, collars, towels...",1
"This is a very nice storage bin.

The material is very thick and more than likely, it will be able to withstand some rough play (human or dog).  It does not have the panel in between the fabric that makes other storage bins stay standing so you need to make sure to hold it open if you are trying throw some stuff in there.

The handles are made out of very soft rope (not the stiff kind, think more arts and crafts).  I am afraid they will give up on me if I dare place heavy stuff inside (hey, dog toys can be heavy).  I am sure I can fix that if anything ever happens to them.

I think this is an awesome bag, I love being able to drag it around and not going back and forth when you have a mess to pick up.

The color is a great match to my current carpet, I know it won't show the dirty spots after being set on the floor for a while.",1
"Not sure if putting quiet in the name of the product makes this product any less quieter then any other fountain pump.

It works but its too noisy.  I can hear from many feet away.",0
Recently reviewed after first use and gave a good rating. However upon the second use of the collar it broke without any reason. There was no excessive pulling or anything. The plastic clip that hold the harness over the nose broke and no longer keeps the nose strap secure. Sad the product didn't last longer. Now to try something else.,0

Dog won't eat them; too hard....,0
"I like the leash's design:  the ""hitching"" ability built into the handle.  BUT, basically, I need a retractable leash to do four things:
1) connect securely to my dog's collar/harness
2) extend when my dog pulls on it
3) retract when there is slack in the line
4) lock/unlock when the mechanism is activated

The thin line that the leash is made of so easily twists and folds that it won't retract about 70% of the time, so #3 doesn't fly.
The locking device itself sticks quite often, shooting down #4.

It's ridiculous that such flaws would make it through a product-testing phase of development.",0
"Unfortunately I paid $41 for this thing at my local pet store. It does nothing to deter my Italian Greyhound from barking. He notices it, but he doesn't care and continues barking. I'm having much more success with this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NO-BARK-Collar-Citronella-Spray-Anti-Bark-collar-for-Dogs-Kit/dp/B00987HPFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NO BARK Collar Citronella Spray Anti-Bark collar for Dogs Kit</a>. It's harmless. Even though theoretically he could bark until the oil runs out, I've always come home to a quiet apartment.",0
got these for my rott.  they cracked his nails.  left them splintered and jagged and it hurt him quite a bit.  now im no amature.  ive been grooming my animals at home for many years and have never seen worse quality in a nail trimmer.,0
"It worked really well for us until the clasp broke.  It's made of plastic, and did not click in place just right, so it broke apart when I tried to take it off my dog.  Bummer.",0
Good as ever,1
gypsy loved but went fast lower price so we can get more... a really cool idea the way its made,1
"Great product.  I got them for my son's mini Yorkies and had to cut them in half because the dogs are so small.
They love them.",1
Wayyy to small!!  Very misleaded by advertisement!!,0
"This works great. I give my Miniature Dachshund  a 1/2 a pill everyday. As a side benefit, she doesn't have any fleas.",1
Love that therw is so much less sugar in this compared to other foods,1
"Honestly I was not expecting it to work.. But I was totally desperate enough to try. My Maltese might be cute and adorable, but he never stops barking.. It was starting to drive me insane.. This collar works.. The barking has completely stopped!!! My only issue is that the collar even on the smallest adjustment was too big.. I had to loop it around and make it work, but other than that.. AWESOME!!!!H",1
"I purchased this in 2012 and it still is going strong. My cats love the moving water, but have stopped drinking from the stream. I used to turn it off at night, but have left it running continuously for a couple years now. The motor is the original, but now is much louder than it was in the beginning. I am only thinking of getting a new one because the minerals are not cleaning off so well anymore, and my cats like the faucet version more. I will keep as a back up, but it has been great for over 4 years!",1
"These were dried out and powdery... not sure if they were old or something? The package/seller has them described as soft and chewy, but they're tough and rubbery. I have a chihuahua and she can't eat them, too tough for her, so I was disappointed. They'd be okay for a full sized dog though.",0
"I love this bag, it's super comfy for me and by doggie and I feel like he is secure when he's in there.",1
I was under the impression that this product would stop  my  small dog from  tinkling on the carpet.  This did not happen and I am at a loss  as to what to do.,0
"Useless as backpack.  Straps were too short, making it useless.  In addition, one strap was shorter than the other because it was sawn into the body, apparently folded somewhere inside the bag.  A backpack I could not use as backpack!  Returned immediately, shortly after opening the box.",0
This thing is great and really minimizes my little babies mess.  I love that I can hang it inside or outside of the cage. I'm glad I purchased it.,1
it beautiful,1
Foldable and portable. Perfect size for my 40 lbs  border collie lab mix. Room available for her to grow.,1
"Looks to be tuff  and durable well made only received it today but it will be a favourite for sure,disapointed , a tug toy that didn't last for more than 24 hours with a 8 month old bulldog at one end :-(",0
Looked like a box of brown flour. My dog would have nothing to do with it.,0
"Please, don't waste your money buying this junk. It's a good idea, but the tubing is so flimsy and cheap that it broke before I ever even had a chance to put the vacuum in the water!",0
"BEWARE!!! This will burn holes in your dogs neck! At first it seem to work as directed. They would bark and it would vibrate and if they continued it would eventually shock them and then reset the cycle. They seemed to react and barking was limited. But after a couple of months, they are barking all the time again. The collar doesnt even seem to even be bothering them anymore. I haven't changed the settings. Then one day as I was petting my dogs, I felt like a scab or something. I go to check and OMG there were huge soars on their necks, obviously from the collar. I was so devesated that I had put them through that for simply barking. Dont waste your money thinking because this is expensive that it must be a quality item, it is not. At this point, I don't think the risk of putting your dog through the pain from this item that will eventually leave them with soars is worth trying to limit their barking.",0
Got these to try since I have many foster kittens at any given time and needed a litter that was safe if they ingested some as they learned to use the litter. This was horrible the kittens hated going into it and it smelled right away. It also made the kittens sneeze a lot. I changed back to my old brand and the kittens stop sneezing and used the litter all the time. I still have a half of bag I don't know what to do with since I cant use it for litter. Would not buy again,0
"I had high hopes for this as my pup is half Great Pyrenees an they are notorious for wandering off, the problem was that he only got shocked once on the lowest level and was then too afraid to go outside with it on.  We are lucky to live 2 miles up and at the end of a dirt road so I am not worried about cars but just him bugging the neighbors.  But, with how strange and scared he started acting, id rather just take my chances with the neighbors.  And once we started letting him go out as much as he wanted, he spends all his time sitting on the porch.  Im sure this would be great if you lived in the city but be careful, if your dog starts exhibiting scared behaviors, SLOW DOWN.  I think if he had been schocked more than a few times it might seriously effect his personality.  Our training methods were VERY hands off and VERY treat oriented so I think this just didn't fit in with his understanding of right vs wrong.",0
"Does not work as well as other brands. Less odor, but that is probably why it does not work as attractant.",0
Outstanding. The collar has only been charged once and is still going strong after a month.,1
My cat did this star review. No good.,0
Lid could or was broken due to hinge cracked.  Never ever able to use lid.,0
Very misleading packaging and description.  These are NOT real bully sticks.  The brand is Best Bully Sticks- not the product.  These are similar to a Pedigree Dentastick.  They are in no way shape or form a real Bully stick.  The company contacted me to ask what I thought and when I told them- they tried to tell me they are a chew and that is how they are described.  It's not listed anywhere on the bag or description.  WAY to expensive for what they really are.  My puppy doesn't really care for them.  Save your money and look for something else.,0
"First one came damaged with an un finished tail, the replacement was perfect. My dog is a toy killer and it still lasted a week so I am impressed. My other dog who chews but not as agressively still has a different one from this line (the whale) for months now and it's still going strong.",1
"Said it has a bell, but it doesn't. Also, the embroidery is too spread out. On my cat's previous collar, her name and phone number were closer together, so that when I applied the clasp, they could be read without taking the clasp off. On this collar, you'd have to take the collar off to read the phone number because it is partially covered by the clasp after adjusting the collar to fit. A bit hard to explain, but it matters.",0
"This new formula falls apart.  There are not nuggets in the container, rather just crumbs.  I am left with how to portion the crumbs?",0
"Boots fall off after walking in snow, would not recommend or purchase again.",0
"I am very pleased with this dog coat, the quality and materials are very good. I bought a black one and it looks like a ""people coat"" instead of a silly toy dog dress up coat. My only minor complaint is that I wish the front leg openings were a bit longer; the coat is a bit snug under my dog's front leg ""arm pits"" but not enough to be a problem. The sizing must be running small. My little Schipperke weighs 12 1/2 pounds, with a 10"" neck to rump length, 10 1/2"" neck, 18 1/4"" chest girth. The chart suggests a size medium but I bought the large. Other than the snug leg holes it is a perfect fit. That size is long enough to cover her entire back and most of her underside. The velcro adjustment tabs give enough adjustment range. I am sure that a medium would have never fit her. I highly recommend this product!",1
These bones smell horrible! Wouldnt recommend.,0
"My dogs like these well enough, but they don't go nuts for them like they do some of the other treats I give them. And these smell HEINOUS!!! After first giving them to my two pups, I wandered around trying to figure out who had pooped, where, until I finally realized the horrid smell was coming from these hooves. Now that I read that they can cause serious damage to young dogs' teeth, I will not buy them again, and the remaining 8 in the pack will go to waste.",0
"Oh my god this thing is HYSTERICAL.  I put it on my dog and tried to get a picture but he wasn't thrilled with wearing it so it came out a bit blurry.  There is DEFINITELY no way they can bite with this on.  It's like a cone of shame for their muzzle.  I laughed when I opened the package, it really is this bright duck bill.  I actually bought it for my mothers nasty little dachshund, he's a mean little sucker that will bit anything or anyone.  He pees in the house and the only people that can get near him without bloodshed are my mother and my sister.  Not that my sister is very fond of him.  The plan is to sneak this on the jerk dog right before my mother comes home so it's the first thing she see's when she comes in the door.  Hopefully she'll laugh hard enough that she'll agree to keep it on him when company is around.  I will update my review on the results.

For reference I got the medium size and that is a 24 lb dachshund mix in the picture.",1
"Nothing wrong with this carrier at all.  Its easy to assemble, easy to clean, sturdy, well ventilated, comfortable to carry, and well priced.  There are certainly more expensive, fancier carriers out there, but this is all one really needs.",1
My little destruction machine has been working on this for over 2 months!,1
"Poor quality, not safe for pet at all. Received with a broken zipper as well",0
"My rabbits love this. It helps satisfy their chewing needs and is easy for them to pick up and toss around, which is very funny to see. I buy them one every few months, whether it is worn out or not.",1
"This Trainer collar works, but not well on our dog.  Maybe its because we have a Mastiff.  She barks right through it.  I have turned it all the way up and it doesnt really bother her.  If you have a big dog I would try something diffrent",0
"I'm not sure who's supplying these or where they're coming from. We've bought them several times on Amazon because it's convenient and cheaper than getting them at the vet. Our dog loves them. But I opened the lkast bag I got, and the dog would chew them but not with the same enthusiasm. Almost like someone getting a glass of milk that was going sour. I'd find half of one lying uneaten/unchewed. Then she chewed of the corner of one, left the rest, and seemed lethargic. Later that day she vomitted. All that came out was yellow bile and a piece of the chew. We, of course, haven't given her any more. My wife called the company to report what happened, and when she told them where we bought them, they said we couldn't have bough them through Amazon because they're only sold through veterinarians. We're not buying any more of them on line.",0
I GOT TWO OF THEM FOR MY FURRY BABY. STILL SQUEAK BUT NO LIGHTS.,0
"This product smells wonderful.  My dog has some allergy issues which make her itch.  So, she gets a bath every week.  I'm somewhat of an expert in shampoos, conditioners, etc.  This is one of the best smelling products I have found. I just wish they'd put the ingredients on the label for those of us label readers who worry about our pet's sensitivities.",1
My cat absolutely loves these things. I feel better about feeding him these because they are grain free...unlike the wiskas temptations and many other cat treats.,1
"This product is extremely unhealthy for chinchillas. Just because it's labeled for them, trust me and everyone else when they say it's not. I have a chinchilla and she only gets Oxbow chinchilla pellets, go buy that instead.",0
My fur babies will not eat them,0
Wasn't able to get my dogs too eat it.,0
"We have a 7 pound chihuahua mix and a 45 pound American Staffordshire mix. The size of this food is perfect for both and they love it. Their digestive systems have cleaned up as we had problems with other ""premium"" dog foods. Now our cats are also eating the food. Haha Finally found the perfect dog(/cat) food!",1
Great product. Very heavy duty. Exactly what I was after to move my larger snakes. Actually a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. Highly recommend!!,1
Our dog loves it......,1
The first unit I received stopped working after less than five minutes of use so I exchanged it through Amazon.  The second unit arrived a couple days later and that one failed in relatively the same amount of time.  I attempted some basic troubleshooting to no avail.  The product is simply not constructed well.,0
Very easy to change. Perfect fit.,1
I have a yellow lab and a mixed breed dog it took them exactly one hour to destroy this toy.  I would not recommend this toy.,0
"I measured the dog and bought accordingly,  but it was way too small! Then I was out of the country and forgot to return it in time. What a pain.",0
Works well,1
Wonderful size for my 12 inch 10 pound Chihuahua/ Min Pin. The harness fits nicely and will last you for a good year before it breaks. We've tried every harness and this one out beats all of them. One modification I wish they would do is have a stronger stitch so the straps do not break/come apart.,1
These are amazing. Makes cleaning the box so much easier.,1
"Ruby gets one of these after she goes potty, she loves them will do anything thing for them. I do however wish they were organic because non organic chicken is not really good for her, it increases your chance of cancer and makes tumors grow. If they ever went organic it would be the only treats I would buy her.",1
I used to buy this hammock for my cats. they used to make it with a stretch velvet or dotted.the last five I have bought have failed at the corners. the hooks stay the cats fall. lucky I only used it on lower level.,0
"The stairs were not easy to put together. One connection snapped off in the process, though it does not seem to affect the stability of the stairs.
I purchased the stairs for my 10 year old Lab who recently suffered the loss of a rear leg. I figured the stairs would make it possible for him to once agai get on the bed, and also make it easier for him to get into the backseat of my car. No dice. He wants nothing to do with the stairs. I will keep trying to acclimate him to them, but so far they have been a waste.",0
"Nice holder, I use the mesh pouch to hold the training clicker.",1
My cat loves the tunnel :),1
"This Muzzle Stays On. It's also stronger than those flimsy mesh ones for those of us that have a larger dog or one that requires true security. They can still Bark through it, but tend to less. Trips to the Vet, etc - Perfect. They can also eat & drink through it, you probably want to feed your dog out of your hand to show them this.",1
Used for 6 Months and the motor burnt out... The motor costs almost as much as the whole unit.  Piece of Junk if you ask me.  Products don't last any more.,0
Be aware Instinct recently changed the recipe and now includes turkey. The previous recipe used pork liver instead of turkey. Cats with poultry allergies can no longer eat Instinct Lamb without getting sick.,0
"The pooch pants male wrap did not perform as was promised.  My severly ill dog was givem prednisone which causes extreme thirst and extreme unrination.  The pooch pants did not contain the unrination.  They may work if your dog has a minimal problem but anything severe the pants will not containe the urine. I could not use the pants at all and would really like my money back, but I suppose that is not going to happen.  I have since lost my dog to the disease.",0
"This training tool works wonders. I don't even have to use the hand controller any more. I just put the collar on and he is the obediant dog. I watched a utube about the proper use and never shock the guy; just vibrate. Also the company is very fair. The first model stopped working after a rainstorm and when I called there was not balking, he just sent a replacement right out!",1
"I ordered this the Simplicity Skimmer when my old Hydor bit the dust. I'm impressed at the build of this skimmer. It makes a lot of micribubbles and skimate. The pump is super quiet. Also, customer support from the guys over at Simplicity is fast.",1
Ad description says for adult cats. I was disappointed in the small support columns. I have small grown cats and the cat tree seems too small for them.,0
I like it. It is definatley for a small bird.,1
"Great scratching post. My cat loves it so much, she sleeps on it. I would definitely purchase this item again.",1
waste of money,0
great product,1
"No doubt, it works! I put a little amount of it inside of Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy in purpose permanently keep my cat's attention to it.",1
"It's really strange... I purchased this product on sale at my local pet store. I figured I would try it since it was only $2 for 3 applications.  It seemed to work pretty good.  So, I reordered thru Amazon and have already tried two doses on each of my cats and it is not doing anything to kill the fleas... they continue to scratch and I continue to keep pulling fleas off them.  It is very messy when you put it on your pet, it takes days to dry and if you touch your pet in that area, it is very oily and it gets all over your hands.  I don't think I will reorder and I really liked the idea of this product being a little more natural that what else is on the market.",0
"This product has only two faults:
1. Difficult to remove paper to expose sticky backing.  No tab or other aid provided
2.  It does not work: two digital thermometers agree that aquarium temp is 78.  On the ATI thermometer, installed several hours ago, all numbers are equally bright or dim and all are the same color.
Did I install it following ATI directions?  Yes.  Will I return it?  No, not worth the bother.
My advice: buy one of the digital units.",0
It was way smaller than I expected.  I didn't read the full details of this. You're better off making your own dish for your pet,0
Ripped first day,0
Best leash I've ever had.,1
"These are dog treats. They are okay, nothing special. My dog didn't seem to be very excited about them, but he still ate them. I apparently either didn't feed him these quickly enough or I couldn't seal the bad tightly enough because they dried out and became crumbly. There are much better treats out there which are a better value. Skip these.",0
"Might work for you dog(s) but mine feel ""eh"" about it. Excited at first but that only lasted for a minute. Will be giving to another dog owner When I get a chance.",0
Malfunctioned shocking my dog uncontrollably and the batteries died really quick !  I don't recomend them at all! Won't buy again!,0
It shipped super fast and I love it! It is the perfect way to honor my sweet kitty.,1
"We purchased this pump about ten months ago and it has already failed.  We were using it to power our undergravel filter in a 30 gal freshwater tank.  It should have been able to run smoothly for quite a while.  It failed about six months after we got it...I purchased an Aqua Culture pump from Walmart and that works great.  Perhaps it's because this Fusion pump doesn't have double outlets, although that really shouldn't make a difference in product longevity. Still, I don't recommend this pump for anything more than powering a single decoration or bubbler...",0
"Didn't like. Asked for a refund. Burns the eyes. Try on you. Sticky and the smell !!!! We have to rinse a lot a lot to get rid of it.

I like a lot spa facial scrub by tropiclean. Very tear free.",0
My German Shepherd wore them for 5 hrs in the house and they fell apart. Very disappointed.,0
"I read the comments and pondered whether this was a good toy for Bonnie the border collie, but her border collie buddies love (read: destroy) theirs, so I hoped Bonnie would enjoy this. Nope. It's too big for a 35-pound border collie, and the small ones are just too small. Her disappointment breaks my heart!",0
Awesome quality for the price.,1
I was looking for something that my Doxle (Dauschund-Beagle Mix) would enjoy and could carry around easier than the larger toys that usually get caught under his legs. He loves it! The squeak sound is a little different from his other toys-which is a good thing as he can have variety- and he can carry it around with ease. We played fetch for an hour with this toy. It was also extremy funny for myself and my husband to see our dog carrying around a chicken sandwich. I would recommend this for any small-medium size dog.,1
"I've had my dog on this for 2 months now.  I doubled the dose for the first 30 days and am now on a single dose but see no improvement.  The vet did say he has arthritis back there and recommended this product.  He limps on the one leg when he gets up mostly and some other times I see him limping as well.  It hasn't changed since before the pills.  I estimate I have enough pills to last him for 2 more months and if still no improvement, I'm stopping the pills and stopping wasting my money.
Only pluses to this is he eats them happily as if they're treats.  The smell is really not horrible, it could be improved but does any dog food product really smell ""good""?",0
"First, the flower came off before I even put it on the kitty.  Second, it's so incredibly huge that I had to cut the end off so I could wrap it small enough.  Not to mention I had to drill holes for the buckle to fit in.  This is NOT a quality collar- obviously because it was cheap.  But when it says cat or puppy- you think small.  NOT!  This thing is bigger than that.  Way bigger than that.",0
"We have two cats, one dominant alpha male and one passive male.  We used the collars for two months and noticed zero difference in their temperament.  I was not fond of the smell personally, but willing to learn to live with it if it helped, but again no difference at all, did not help.  My cats did not seem to mind wearing the collar, which is good to know, but it did nothing so it was a waste of money for us",0
"I've worked various types of construction most of my life, therefore I have put a few things together over the years. I purchased the ""Lucky Dog"" kennel along with the canopy covering. To my dismay the kennel was missing half the connecting screws for the framework and the continous 30 foot chain link fencing was so snagged and tangled I wasted an hour of time just getting it strightened out. Once I had the frame together and the fencing attached I discovered that the canopy framework was 3 5/8 inches shorter than the horizontal end-frame of the kennel. To solve this problem I had to disconnect the fencing on the kennel and shorten both the top and bottom pieces of the end framework. I then had to reattach the wiring. Long story short- I wasted 3 hours of extra time, and a simple job turned into a big pain.  This outfit is a joke!  Jim in Kelseyville Calif.",0
Cats turn up their noses at this food and beg for something else.,0
Did not work,0
Fun and very digestible,1
At first I rated this five stars because it was great and I have the matching leash. But my dog has been wearing this collar for a month and I went to give her a bath and noticed her entire neck is pink!! The collar turned her fur all the way to her skin pink and I couldn't even wash it out. I am very upset over my black dog having a pink neck and have now thrown away the collar and the leash.,0
My DYH is addicted to these. I can't order enough. I wish they came in bigger bags!,1
Must have product.  Great for saltwater fish health and gives strength against disease.,1
fitment perfect the dogs are happy again,1
"Durable, attractive. Great buy!",1
My cats did not like.  However my cats are very finicky.  So please don't blame the product.  I think the problem is my cats.,0
"So good I bought another one!  Panasonic has a winner here.  Too bad so expensive, but works great! Quality product except the power adaptor which seems to burn out after a couple of years.  Can easily buy another one though, or compatible one. You'll need to know a little about opening up a port and port forwarding on your home router if you want to see the video remotely, especially with more than one camera.  ""Zoom"" feature is digital only and only in Internet Explorer. Sound only in I.E. too I think. Resolution is good. Camera lens does not physically zoom, but does actually move left right up down. Microphone is very sensitive and motion detection does work well.  Internal memory can hold several hours of captures depending on what resolution/size you choose and frame rate / number of frames per capture. Very configurable. I got the BL-C131A.",1
"Says 30 inch tube fixture on the back. The hood is 30 inches, but the actual tombstone placement is much smaller inside the hood. Poorly labeled.",0
poor and cheap made,0
GREAT,1
I like to mix up his dry food with some wet food to either treat him or if he seems to not really want dry food anymore. With this he can stay happy!,1
I don't think this item is worth the money.  The only reason I'm keeping it is because I have to pay for the return shipping.,0
Doesn't work.,0
"This toy definitely perked my dog's interest, but it has too many electronic parts inside to be safe for pets to be left alone with it (even for a few minutes). I left my dog with it while I left the room to get water and came back to see the battery pack hanging out. My dog does like to tear things up, and maybe he got excited by the sounds to tear up the toy faster, but I didn't like how fast he was able to get to the electronic bits. I wouldn't recommend this if your dog likes to tear things up.",0
"We have this whole collection, they are durable and get washed every-week.  I just wish there were more characters",1
Worth every penny.,1
"If you don't care about your bunny's comfort, happiness, or well-being, then this is the perfect harness for you! It is made of super uncomfy tent-like fabric which digs into your bun's skin, and the hook on the harness falls off so when you're done torturing your bunny by making him wear this, he can get lost outside never to be seen again.
  The harness is cheaply built, but this was expected given the price.  The image shows a harness of a mesh-y material, which certainly looks comfier for the bunny than the tent-like material the one I received was made of.  Also, the hook on the back of the harness falls off (an easy fix, but a huge problem out of the package since it means a loose bunny);  I was just lucky we were testing it out inside at first, otherwise would could have lost our little mini-lop/rex.  Needless to say, my bunny and I will not be using this garbage again and would advise against purchase of this particular harness for anyone else.",0
good price for the exact same product,1
"My 3.5 lb. chihuahua was scratching all over, hot spots all over his body for several months. I tried different kinds of sprays with herbal, natural, hydrocortisone sprays, anti- bacterial shampoos and a lot more.  Zymox Topical Pet cream with hydrocortisone is the only one that helped. I applied this ointment on his hot spots, where redness and open wounds on his back were. His skin was clear in 5 days and itching went away in 7 days.
FYI: Never use bare hands to apply ointments on pets and other people. Use Qtips or gloves.
I highly recommend this ointment to pets with hot spots, allergies on skin, itchiness, open wounds and etc.
I'm ordering another tube for future use. Thank you.",1
This diffuser didn't seem to help.  After a few hours it smelled like it was burning.  I changed outlets and even replaced the oil pack but it continued to give off a smell of burned plastic. I was concerned it was a fire risk.,0
This is very very thin. Not at all what we were expecting,0
Bought 6-7 of these they are a good cheap product get a thermostat though these have no regulation.,1
We really like this fly mask. It is the second one we have had. It lasts longer and seems to fit the best.,1
Great and safe wipes. keeps our little dog clean. I love that it is fragrance free and is just tended to clean the dog with no unnecessary additives.,1
"This company doesn't even deserve one star...they have just changed their labels; and naturally, when that happens, they change the food formulations--not for the better!  No more ""Natural Chicken Flavor"", no more ""Sweet Potatoes, Squash, Zucchini"", no more ""Blueberries"".  No more Chelated minerals.  Now ""Guar Gum"" is the 7th ingredient instead of the 12th.
  I can just add this to yet another pet food company cheapening a product that the public had come to trust.  Now I need to waste some more time searching once again for a safe wet food for my pets, because this was not necessary.  I just hope people start paying attention to what goes into their pets' food as well as their own, and don't patronize a company that doesn't care about them or their pets' health.",0
"I have 3 pitbulls, each weigh about 100 lbs each.  The collars fit good around the neck of the 2 girls but it barely snaps closed around the boys neck.  They work great, and stay charged for a good period of time.  We keep them in the house and only put the collars on them when we take them out.  The sound option is loud enough to be heard and seems to have a good range of distance that the remote works for.  We generally don't have to use the shock option because the vibration and sound is enough to get their attention (I was worried that the vibration wouldn't be intense enough since they are such large dogs).  I love how the same charger charges all of the pieces, and that you can remove the shock box from the collar without removing the collar if needed.",1
"I had searched like crazy looking for a quality crate travel crate that didn't cost an arm and a leg. This crate is sturdy enough for daily use, but I mostly use it as a travel crate for the car. It opens from the front, side and top, meaning no matter how you put the crate in your car, the dog can get easily in and out. As with any fabric crate, don't put a chewer in here. One of my favorite parts about this crate is the height. Many crates for small dogs assume the dog is short in stature. As my little guy is a leggy Italian Greyhound, that was a problem in the past, but not with this crate. This is a crate he can stand in without it being too big in other dimensions. This crate has straps, folds up easily, has a little pouch for food and toys and even comes with a soft liner. Fits a little dog bed perfectly. Overall, a great crate.",1
"Way to small for a medium , yea it said medium but it was xs and dog don't feet on xs waste of money, and it also took way to long to get here a whole month really ?",0
Works great!!!,1
"My cat was crazy about the first few cans but refused to eat the rest, then I gave them to my brothers cat who also refused to eat them. What a bummer, the chicken smelled nice.",0
My dog is very  picky about treats. For whatever reason she likes these. I like that they are vegetarian. I don't trust the meat they put in dog food these days. They make my dogs breath smell great.,1
Ok so I have a 90 pound dog. I will say that he fits perfectly in this but this isn't a secure durable cage. It took him around 10 mins to get out. I would spend more money and get a better cage if your dog is anything like mine... smart and determined. Also the locks didn't line up correctly so they were hard to latch on.,0
Best dog food out there!!!,1
great brush. arrived quickly,1
Corydoras catfish seem to enjoy these wafers very much.,1
My two toy Schnauzers love these!,1
"As a dremel it's cheap.  The worst part is the smell of nail dust.  Reminds me of the dentist.  It's tolerable to round out a jagged edge or 2, but is no substitute for a pair of clippers.",0
"I've been giving these to my dog for years now, and he can't seem to get enough! Not only are they beneficial to dogs' oral well-being, they are also healthy.",1
"WARNING !!!!!!
Do not purchase this.
My dog was rushed to the vet after only having this collar on his neck for a week. It was obviously faulty and burned two holes into my dogs neck. These holes got infected very quickly. Tried to post a letter from our vet to this review, however amazon will not post it. Luckily my other dog was not hurt from the second collar. Vet bill was over $200.00",0
"My cat loves it. Sometimes he won't eat his food unless this is added to it. He has IBD, so the probiotic in this helps. Can't get enough of this and have to keep a steady stock of it for him.",1
"Way too expensive for what you're buying. Why I bought it? I needed a quick get-up for a party where friends would meet our new adopted dog. From the picture, I assumed the strap would pull out and expand to some manageable length. Prime shipping was the determining factor here: impulse buy. The Problem: the strap is only large enough to loop around the neck of a tiny dog or cat, even when fully extended. My hefty little dog was hopeless. The best part about this? The flower and the decorative pearl button at the center. The actual flower is nicely made and on it's own (removed from the strap) and could be re-purposed into something very cute. If I could go back in time, I don't know if i'd spend as much as I did for what amounts to a decorative flower.",0
Great container. Holds a lot of dry food. Easy to move around and open and closes good. I like it's low profile which makes it incognito. Seems to seal good. It has a rubbery liner ring that keeps it air tight.,1
The best light I've ever had,1
I am so happy with this product. This is the 3rd month and my dog is running around the back yard and literally hopping on all fours when he gets really excited. It's like he never had the surgery on his hip.,1
"Over priced. You can find cheaper ones with a stand to put it in. If I had a choice, I would not have purchased this item.
It looks great but not worth the money.",0
"My dog gets one of these every night at bedtime, and when she hears them rattle she makes a beeline for her crate.  She absolutely loves these treats.",1
Worthless!,0
My dogs didn't even go near it I have it away :(,0
Fantastic for my Fluval Spec III. It's surprisingly difficult to find a gravel vacuum small enough in a store and this is exactly what I was looking for. Seems pretty sturdy and does exactly what I hoped it would.,1
"I don't get it-- the regular ZerOdor is fantastic, but this one is awful-- it actually makes the pet urine smell even stronger!!",0
"I have used Simple Solutions diapers for years now.  I experimented with other diapers over the years and few fit as well as these.  Some of the more expensive diapers fit as well but these diapers are less money so I can buy more and change them more often, a blessing with incontinent pets. The fabric is good also, thick enough to do the job without being too bulky.  Of course the dog is offended the first time they have to wear one, see photo, but they aren't going to get it off, and it is comfortable for them whether they want to admit it or not!",1
fit my 5 pound chihuahua perfectly,1
I thought these are pretty good.,1
"Terrible. Absolutely terrible. I have no idea how Disney could be OK with this having their name on this. This thing was painted with a 12 inch roller, and the item is only two inches tall. Ariel has one eye where it should be, and another near her ear.",0
"I adopted a cat that was 5 years old and he loved my couch and door frames.  I read all the recommendations for the best material for scratching posts and this one fit the bill.  He wasn't interested for couple of weeks no matter what I did (catnip has no affect on him) but one day he went to town and has used it exclusively since then.

It is very well made and sturdy and tall enough for him to stretch and get in a good scratching.  It is durable and hasn't fallen apart like some other materials do in a short period of time (the rope kind in particular come apart easily with vigorous scratching).

This isn't cheap but to me is worth the money, much cheaper than replacing my couch and door frames.  Highly recommend.

Updated Jan 2016:  After a year, you can't see any wear and tear on the sisal and he scratches on it multiple times a day.  Very pleased with the durability.",1
My dog loves these treats. He gets them in the evening after dinner as a treat.  And sometimes before bed time.,1
I love these. I have had them for over two years now. I bought two of them here on Amazon in 2014 and they are still going strong. Makes changing collars so easy.  Just unclimbed from one collar and clip onto another. Just that easy your dog's tags are transferred to another collar! highly recommend.,1
Durable yet biodegradable!  Discovered these bags after visiting a California State Park!  I have 3 dogs and use one bag for all yard pick ups every morning.  Saves on using extra bags in the end!  I keep a box hanging by the mud room door on our way in and out.  Neat and organized system!,1
Works great,1
No good,0
"the kong did not last 2 days(started to tear ,dogs pulling on it).will look into something else.",0
Product was not a gel. It is liquid and poured out all over my hand and table. I emailed the company 2 weeks ago and have not heard anything from them.,0
"Fell apart, Hard as a rock ! My Lab, who is not Fussy Ever, wouldn't even finish the piece I gave her !  Sorry,  It is what it Is  :(",0
Recommended to me by my vet.  Works great!,1
"I initially tried to order this over 1 year ago, but after receiving the wrong item TWICE, I ended up ordering the Reptispa. Since 1 year has passed & you're supposed to replace them yearly, I decided to try to order the Zoo Med again (I like to rotate products just in case the UVB output of a certain brand is insufficient).
The light on the Zoo Med flickers & turns off every time I turn it on. It eventually comes back on, but the crackling noises it makes make me nervous. It initially heated up really well the first few days, but now not so much. If this does last the year, I will go back to the Reptispa or try the Mega Ray.
Update 1/4/17- the light is officially dead. So frustrating since this is supposed to be a high quality brand. My poor turtle keeps climbing up to her basking area & then diving off again since it's too cold . Luckily I have Amazon Prime, so my Reptispa bulb will be here in 2 days (but it'll be a difficult 2 days for my turtle- she LOVES to bask!).",0
works great when i had issue thay sent me a new one,1
We expected these pads to be of better quality. We used to buy pads from Jeffers Pet with the same name by the same vendor. They were much think and controlled odor much better than the pads from this order. We wish we could find the better pads again. Not sure if I'll buy these again or not.,0
"On the first one I received two of the clips were frozen and would not move - I even tried tools but could not budge them. I requested a replacement which arrived promptly, but on this one three of the clips were frozen and would not move. For the first replacement PetEdge Dealer Services did not require me to return the defective one, but for some reason on the second return they are now asking me to ship the defective item back to them. So it's officially entered pain-in-the-neck territory.

Considering that this thing is a piece of cloth and four clips you'd think the manufacturer would want to have something other than the cheapest possible Chinese hardware they could buy, but evidently not. In my experience the failure rate on the clips is now +50% and I fully expect the second replacement to be bad too.",0
"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CATS IN SEVERAL LOCAL STORES FOR YEARS.  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE IT LOCALLY ANY LONGER, SO I HAD TO PURHCASE IT ONLINE.  THE FORMULA HAS CHANGED AND IS NOT THE SAME.  IT IS VERY DRY AND A DIFFERENT TEXTURE/MAKE-UP AND MY CATS WON'T EAT IT.",0
Appears to be good quality.  A nice weight sweatshirt to help keep my shi tsu/bichon mix warm in the New Englad winters.  Size was true to size chart.,1
"I had the Ruffwear Webmaster harnesses for my two poodles. My older dog is a houdini (the Webmaster works well for him), but doesn't pull. My younger poodle doesn't try to escape, but she pulls on the Webmaster harness with excitement, even after obedience training. While I wouldn't trust my houdini with this Front Range harness (his favorite trick is pulling straight back and out of a harness, like a mule), I decided to try it with my younger poodle for her pulling. It works like a charm! The X Small worked for her. She is 17 lbs. With this harness on, she doesn't pull at all. It does twist slightly to either side but her legs did not come out, even when she was bouncing in excitement. But in just one walk she is like a cloud floating on the end of the leash. Very little gasping, totally unlike her steady pulling and choking before. Magic! My husband agreed and was amazed. If your dog pulls, set them up for success with a front clip harness like this one.",1
"we wanted this food for our cats, but our cats didn't like it much.",1
I really like these; the odor is quite pleasant and doesn't seem like it just masks the odors from the cat litter boxes. I just wish there was something on the back of them for hanging them up on a wall.,1
"Went through batteries every other day.. Then when it would die it wouldn't retract so it would stay in the middle if the cat box, my cats were confused so peed on the floor.. As much as you pay for batteries it's not worth it you may as well scoop it yourself.",0
This is a really good collar. It seems like it's worth the money. It doesn't work for our dog because he has breathing problems and it shocks him when he sneezes. We sent it back.,1
"Purchased Wednesday, received Thursday and within an hour he has chewed through the extra loop making it ineffective.  We had the collar tight enough with out being too tight and this still happened.  He could have gotten it stuck on his teeth which would have been really scary!",0
The only complaint I have is I would have loved to have gotten it for $30 instead of $45 simply because I think that would be a fair price. But wow is my water crystal clear!!! I less then 24 hours. The water isn't that clear from tap! I should also mention Im using it in a 75gallon tank. My problem wasn't green water or anything that horrible it had been a cloudy white haze I couldn't get rid of. I tried every other way to get rid of it. Added a second filter aqua clear 110 and even did the normal weekly water changes and gravel vac. I tried less vac and more water changes same time different time but nothing was helping. Yes my tank is a couple fish over stocked we just had to have them lol but this thing did a miracle for me. You cant get clear water!!!! Highly recommend,1
suction does not stay,0
"Our dog chewed through it two weeks after we bought it. Waiting to hear back from Nature's Miracle about the warranty/a replacement. Regardless, I would never buy again. The fabric is extremely flimsy and my pup, who is crate trained and extremely docile, had no issues chewing right through the mesh.",0
"I don't usually write reviews, but I wanted to share that our very picky (what cat isn't picky?) cat, Schupps, has really embraced her new bed.  When we first received the bed, I tried to coax her into the bed, she wasn't having it and immediately stepped out.  However, after a couple days she started to try it out, and now this is her preferred spot whenever we leave the house.  She will spend literally the entire afternoon snoozing in it.",1
"I was really excited to try Ziwi, as it has some of the best ingredients of all cat food brands on the market. But after feeding it to my cats, the older one vomited several times. I guess she must be sensitive to the mussels or the kelp. She's had lamb and chickpeas before.",0
"Love this hat, it definitely starts conversations for you and gets a good laugh from people. Only bad thing is the white version is impossible to keep clean, I have had to wash it several times already.",1
My cats wouldn't eat them.,0
"This is a cute idea, but my rabbit chewed through it within 5 minutes. Now I have a little piece of wood.",0
Great quality,1
"The box was bent and broken open when I got it. I was sorely disappointed in the way they shipped this. It was literally just the package the bubbler comes in, with a label slapped on it. One end of the box was shredded, which caused damage to the item inside (unfortunately I couldn't tell it was cracked until I put it into my tank. Horrible. So one of the end pieces was cracked and now when I put it in my tank it releases really large bubbles out of one side of it. Of course, since this goes into a water tank, it is impossible to return.

So now I am stuck with basically an LED light and had to go out and buy a 24 inch bubble wand to make the bubbles. It looks like the product would have been cool, but horribly shipped, and now i have a 30 dollar piece of plastic with some lights on it. Not impressed.",0
"I didn't realize what a pain it would be to put this together. My husband had to go to home depot to find parts because it doesn't come with them. To top it off, my cat didn't like it at all. Holes are rather small.",0
Was effective in helping kitty get through flea & tick season without so much anemia as in past years.,1
"The table is a lot sturdier than what I was expecting for the price.  The wood is solid and holds up like a rock to my wiggling two month old, who is already trying to throw herself over the side.  I'm 5'9"" and the overall height is perfect for changing baby without causing a backache.  I debated getting one with drawers instead of the open shelves because I like things neat, but I've been organizing everything in small, clear plastic bins; the shelf height is perfect to accommodate two stacked up.

The pad is really thin (otherwise this would be a five star review), so I've been using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Infant-Contoured-Changing-Pad-16-5-34-x-32-5-34/dp/B009EDSWJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad (16.5"" x 32.5"")</a>&nbsp;with it and it fits perfectly.",1
Works good with peanut butter,1
As described. Dogs love this food and have been on it for years. The pieces of meat are great in size.,1
"This is a healthy food that is not harsh on your pup's system.  It's a different texture and it may take your dog a bit to get used to it.  Stick with it if your dog is hesitant at first.  I do notice my dog has to go out a little more often when eating this...that's probably those extra veggies.  This comes in a single bag and you pour out the amount you need and mix it with water and let it set, then feed to your dog.  The servings and amounts needed for each based on your dog's size and activity are on the box.  It's a quick and easy way to get your dog the nutrients it needs.",1
My dog loved it...little pricey tho...tried something less expensive and she doesn't care for it as much...will switch back.,1
Very Happy charge has lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.,1
"Battery case pops off after every third cut, batteries fly out. Indicator (the sole reason for spending this kind of money on a clipper) is inaccurate. Either stays red or stays green all the way down to the base of the nail. I had to turn it on and off before every individual nail cut, and even then, it would work 50% of the time.

I agree with the other reviewers that it is garbage.",0
"These seem awfully expensive for what they are: rolled up rawhide treats. Yes, they have something in the middle (that's the annoying part, since it's slightly crumbly and gets in my carpet). They aren't THAT big, and thirteen dollars seems like a lot for these, I've paid much less (even on Amazon) for similar or better treats in the past.",1
"My cats both hated this food, and they aren't particularly picky eaters - both enjoy a variety of flavors and brands. However, my two cats would both rather not eat than eat this brand, unless I mixed it with dry food, which I normally don't have to do - and even then, they didn't lick the bowl clean as usual. It just wasn't the right fit for this house.",0
"Looks good love the red,white and blue!",0
Buy this all the time  Great product,1
"I've used both this brush and the ""furminator"" and I'd say that this one works just as well as the name brand, if not better. It's so much less expensive and it doesn't seem to tug on my dog's fur as much as other brushes. I have a Welsh Corgi so shedding is a constant. This brush really helps.",1
"We have begun slowly reintroducing Sojos back into our dogs diet. It's a great raw type of dog food. We still add meat for our pooches evening meal. We soak this longer than the honest kitchen, because it is chunkier. Our dogs like this food very much.",1
I never receieve my pet id tag and haven't heard from u to find out what happen cant give a good rate yet,0
"This bed is perfect. I have two French Bulldogs - 35 pounds and 25 pounds and they can both curl up in it with a bit of room to spare. I bought a size Large. I think for one French Bulldog, I would have gone with a Medium, but the Large is perfect for them both to share.

It's very soft but not too squishy and the bolsters are firm and easy for them to lay against.",1
Not good at all wasted my money,0
"I would have given this item 5 stars BUT while the scoop itself makes it the last one you will ever own, the handle isn't made to last forever.  What a shame",1
"Received a big box wrapped in plastic with Alkaline powder leaking out, even got some in my mouth, had to spit for hours to get rid of taste, was very dangerious, never buy this online, I should have sued.",0
dogs love it and do good on it,1
"In addition to concerns of others, I'll note that the tiny screws on this device are very fragile. Be careful when installing or replacing battery.  RFID would make a lot more sense.",0
I gave one to my 55 pound dog and my 18 pound dog for Christmas and both fell a part in minutes.  This item is cheap!  I tried to request a return/replace but because of the time limitation I was not allowed.  I do not recommend this for any dog.,0
I ordered two of these for my dogs crate. The original idea was supposed to be to help them calm down and feel safe at night and to get them to quit barking. Unfortunately these covers could not even withstand two hours of my dog being in the crate with them on before they ripped it to shreds.,0
Another big hit with my cats.  Bought a bag after they enjoyed them at the vet's and they've been very popular at home.,1
as advertised but not you only receive 1,1
Works well.  Perfect - or should I say purrfect - temperature.  Our cat seems very comfortable.  Would definitely recommend.  T,1
Not worth the money!  It did not work!,0
The Applewood Smoked Ham was packed and shipped perfectly and tasted great.  It made a wonderful Christmas dinner for our family.  Thanks.,1

"Do not buy, product was spoilt and they have a no return policy. I have bought this in the past with no problem, my birds line up when its feeding time, they love it. Please have a return policy when the shipment turns the product.",0
My pup loves loves loves this bed.  She lays in it all the time and looks like a princess.  I would recommend this for any dog.  It cuddles her so nice and she likes getting in the middle.,1
My aquarium water has been really crystal clear since I started using this and I am able to get at one least a month between filter changes,1
works great,1
"Great product. The adjustment strap makes it easy to get a good fit that stays in place, even when the dog shakes.",1
"Mine lasted only 4 months. What a waste of money! And the rake kept getting messy. Even if I only put a small amount of litter in, the cat would scrape it up at the back and cause the rake to keep running. Luckily I was always home to adjust the litter. Plus I still ended up scraping the front and bottom to get what the rake couldn't. The rake would break up the clumps and leave a mess for me to sift out. More work than ordinary litter box. Better to not waste your money on this product!!!!",0
"UPDATE
I have subtracted a star and now understand what some of the low ratings are for.  I have had these on subscribe and save for two years now and the product has been consistent up to this point. My last order however was an inferior version -- flimsy, half the absorbent material (pad filling appeared patchy), leaks, awful! I use the pad to line my chihuahuas litter box so luckily the floor isn't being ruined, but it still defeats the purpose because he tracks urine out since it doesn't absorb. I'm hoping this is a one time thing or else I'll have to switch brands.

Affordable, absorbant. These pads do a really good job of not allowing urine to soak through to the floor underneath.  I have tried two other brands and both leaked moisture onto the hardwood floor, which defeats the purpose! These are also much more affordable than ones I could buy at local pet stores.",1
Not easy to use? My dog won't drink from it when we take walks. Hard to squeeze the water out of container. Very disappointed.,0
my cats won't play with it or touch it. I think the catnip was too old also.,0
Great deal !,1
My dogs  won't  touch it.,0
Hoping this works well,1
It met my dogs expectations but not the $8 price increase,0
"These had an odd smell to them. Normally, pig ears have have an odd odor, but this was almost a plastic smell?  Whatever it was, my dog noticed it too. Ususally she loves PE. It's one of her favorite treats. But, she wouldn't really touch these. I will not rebuy.",0
"Feels like the ceramic edge makes a smoother cut going through dense fut. The hair length seems true to the manufacturer specs of half an inch.
Great for that finished cut look. Installs just all the other blades. I found the new ceramic material resists heat for cooler, more comfortable cutting. That was always a concern using the all metal blades, they just got too hot all the time every time.",1
The straight shears were good but not the best. The thinning shears went dull after 3 uses. I have medium size hands and I could barely fit my fingers through the eyelets of the shears. Not very happy with this set.,0
dogs love it...cats not so much...mainly purchased it for the cats so I sneak it in on the bottom of their bowl and cover with food hoping they'll get a smidgen of it when eating,1
"Very disappointed,  it's already deteriorating.  How do I get a refund.",0
Didn't fit the head part of my dog and shes a corgi. Had to give it away.,0
My cat loves this,1
"Working great in my 29 gallon aquarium, The water is crystal clear,  It does take about a week for the bio wheel to slow down, and quieten down",1
This filter didn't work from the start.,0
Can't believe how great these really are.  It was so much easier giving my dogs a bath.,1
This step is good for dogs that are medium or smaller. Great quality but it makes it difficult for longer dogs to go up steps. The depth of the stairs make it difficult for the dog to transition to the next step because back legs cant fit in the area with the front. They would almost have to hop simultaneously the next stair to reach. The lab in this photo makes it seem easy for bigger dogs to use it but its actually hard for them.,1
Nitrates have always been a problem for my FOWLR but this product is as advertised.  Brought my nitrates from over 50 to nothing in 4 weeks.,1
"My dog looks adorable in this sweater!! She loves wearing it too. It's fits nicely on her (not too snug) so she is very comfortable and warm in it. She is an 11 lb. Bichon/Poodle mix and I bought the 14"" shirt.",1
"This actually works SO well! Be warned; it is EXTREMELY potent! I accidentally sprayed my dog 4 times and it smelled up our entire apartment.  The good thing is this particular Vanilla scent smells like freshly baked cookies, so it was alright. I would suggest using one, two sprits MAX, and do it from a distance so it falls lightly on your pooch.",1
Worked for summer but now it has let my English bulldogs get heavily infested. 30+ fleas removed and switched to advantage. Never again.,0
Would like to have given it a 0. Neither of my cats will go in the same room with it. I threw it out.,0
"First off let me state that my review is based on using this for a turtle tank and your results may be better for fish.

I had this set up in tandem with a rena xp4 on a 55 Gallon Turtle tank.
While this filter did help the setup some, a turtle proved to be too much for this filter even when set up with another more powerful filter.

The included external pump is a great idea. I like the fact that it was small and could be placed inside the tank without taking up much room.
The small size of the pump is its downfall however. This pump just can't move much water and waste.

The canister design is great. Easy to remove and clean without having to stop the pump.
It cam with plenty of media and I really wanted to love this filter but it just couldn't handle the work load of a turtle.
I have since upgraded to a 75 Gallon Tank and an FX6 Filter and I could not be happier.

This filter is probably good for fish but I can't recommend it for any turtle setups.

Overall the design and function is unique and easy to maintain, i just wish it had a more powerful pump.
In time I may set it up as just a water polisher, keep it as a back up or it may never see use again if my FX6 continues to do the wonder job it is doing.",1
"The soft puppia would  have been ok but I could  not unbuckle it , I had to  take pliers to squeeze it open, I would not buy it again.",0
Last about a day with our Ridgeback/Boxer mix before she tore pieces off.  That money's gone.,0
"I love gadgets and I don't give up easily on making them work for me. So I have purchased THREE SETS of Loc8Tor, to use on my cats' collars.  The really, really frustrating thing is that once in a while Loc8Tor works for me: it leads me to one of my cats who has traveled blocks away and I am overjoyed. But the problems are overwhelming. First, the batteries are very expensive and wear out quickly. Not the fault of Loc8Tor, I guess, but it makes the device undependable: so what if it is working when my cat steps out the door, if the tag that my cat is wearing stops working within an hour? The major problem, however, is that the Loc8Tor itself is very touchy and often fails to perform as promised. For example, although I follow the directions faithfully, I have great difficulty adding and deleting the tags. I spend hours inserting new batteries in the tags to make sure they are functioning, but even then, I am often unable to establish communication between Loc8Tor and the tags.  The upshot: I have spent hundreds of dollars and wasted many, many hours on a product that just doesn't work -- no matter how much I want it to.",0
Smells amazing & is a great product! Flaky skin is gone!,1
"Collar is horrible to try and put on and take off.  Trying to put it on the cat can cause it to randomly break.  Then we find out it doesnt stay secure. when our kitten seemed to moveit out enough to get her mouth caught on it then proceeds to freak out across the apartment.  We had to grab her with a towel and cut it off of her as she was freaking out with a pair of scissors...

Not gonna use it this again since even before that happened it seemed to have no effect at all on my two cats.

AVOID",0
Runs a bit small M would be a better fit,0
"The collar did not entirely keep my dog from being able to chew on herself, Then one of the straps the collar goes thru broke about a week into her wearing it also the zipper came open from the wrong end and is now half open and stuck there. Overall I wouldn't buy another one like this.",0
"I have taken one of my dogs ( before I got the second one) to training classes and she knows how to walk, this type of leash only promotes bad behaviors really, the two dogs on their own walk fine, with this leash (since there's no way really to guide the dogs where they should be walking)  is just a tug of war... There's no way on how to correct the dogs... They pull and pull, the walk is not enjoyable at all... And the handle on the leash isn't comfortable at all. Sorry for the bad review, but that was my experience... Otherwise, the actual quality of the item is great.",0
"I read great reviews, but have been disappointed with this squeeze siphon starter.  It's harder to get started than my larger one.  Two issues, when I stop, it's hard to get it going again.  Also, if the hose falls below the bucket, it will just stop siphoning. I end up wrapping the hose around my arm to keep it up.  A bit of a hassle.",0
"These chairs get mixed reviews both good and bad. They are cheaply made and from China. Most of the sellers are re-sellers. Meaning they sell different products from China and do not manufacture them. They have little to no knowledge about them. I suggest you buy direct from a manufacturer that can answer any questions. They are on Amazon. The good reviews are from buyers who just received the chair. The bad reviews are from buyers who had enough sense to wait awhile before reviewing it. The facts are these wheelchairs have problems. The adjustable legs will consistently slip because the legs are only held up with thumb screws. This is a bad design. Once you adjust the leg height you then tighten the thumb screws. The problem with this is the thumb screw tightens against the leg similar to a wise. In a very short time as your dog moves in the chair the legs will start to slide from its position. Now you need to adjust and re-tighten it again and again. This will cause your dogs legs to drag on the ground and possibly causing injured.

The two round front tubes that go to the front harness are hollow which will be lighter however will crease and bend in time making them useless. The wheels are cheap quality and will wobble and need to be replaced in time The aluminum finish will eventually discolor as it is exposed to the elements. The facts are they are made in China and garbage. They are only good for a short time. Also FYI some seller's will put ""USA"" (not Made in USA) in there photos which is misleading. Do not believe that it is made in the USA unless you see the word's ""MADE IN USA"". Just USA means they are only selling from the USA. The words ""MADE IN THE USA"" means it is made in USA. To recognize these cheap Chinese chairs just look for the thumb screws that hold the legs in place and the two round tubes that go to the front harness. When you but a wheelchair make sure the legs stay in place.",0
If I could have given it 0 stars I would have. It broke the third time I used it with my 75 pound Golden. Yeesh.,0
Would work great if it didn't break so easily.,0
This is a super cute hoodie. I like that it is fleece on the inside. My dog seems to like it quite a bit. It is pretty thin but that suits us since we live in Texas. She is a 65 pound pittie/lab mix and I went with the XXL based on her measurements and I am glad I did. She has a really broad chest and I doubt the XL would have fit. The length is perfect for her. I could see how it wouldnt work as well for a male dog. Definitely measure and don't be worried about sizing up!,1
"Cats LOVE the idea and action, but flimsy design does not withstand play. Tore up in an hour after having to mount base to a piece of tile to prevent knocking over. The butterfly was chewed off, and the entire metal attachment was detached and can't be repaired. A replacement will just have the same results.",0
"Good stuff!!! It is a big relief to have some new good bedding around. I find that opening these types of packages up from the bottom works best by the way. Also btw, pine and cedar bedding for rabbits is quite harmful to them, especially if it hasn't been dried and cured properly; their urine mixing with the sap/oils causes strong toxic fumes (so it is especially bad for them if they're stuck in a cage for any extended amount of time each day.)",1
"Transit took 9 days, plants arrived very compact in a moisture pouch wrapped in a regular grocery bag, but the moisture bag was punctured and several of the plants were dried out beyond repair. The stems were very small, and every plant was yellowed and spotted. The sword is the only plant that seems to be recovering slowly under lights on a fertilized peat base, but for one single surviving stem it isn't worth the price or the wait. I have always been reluctant to purchase plants online, but for the price I couldn't resist. Honestly for the price and the very slow shipping you would be better off just finding a local aquarium store and buying relatively mature potted plants than risk the disappointment of shipping.",0
"This collar was terrible. The vibration nor the shock did nothing to my dog.  I only had the collar for two weeks and it stopped working, for no reason!",0
"Very cheaply designed as the two little plastic clips that secure ball when two pieces are twisted together break easily and doesn't stay together with cat batting it around house. The treat rolls out with very little movement so my cat nudges the ball with her nose, eats the treat and walks away (until 2 a.m.) then bats it around the house for a few seconds until it falls apart.",0
"First of all, I think the idea is great, but my Morkie doesn't like it-it seems to scare her. I think it could be much improved if the umbrella was a clear vinyl. That way you could see your puppy and they could look up and see you. Also, it is difficult to attach to the harness and to remove.",0
This was great at first I love the look but after a few months the whole bottom was giving out from being wet.,0
Its already starting to rust and ive only used it twice! Also the bristles are too harsh for any dogs skin!!,0
I only had this leash for ten days when it stopped working.  I thought it would be useful walking the dog in the dark but it it did not last.,0
"Well darn.  My cat just didn't 'bond' with this at all!  I think it's the slight crackling sound of the thermal layer that put her off.  It's well-made, looks nice and would be a great option for other cats without this 'phobia' I'm sure.  I gifted this to my friend who has an aging cat and he took to it just fine.  As a new cat owner I'm learning that they can be very picky!",0
"Dometop Parrot Cage with Stand met my expectations with the exception that I miscalculated the height. The height was total cage and stand, not just cage height alone. Therefore, the stand was a little shorter than I would have liked it due to my dog who seems to continue to show an unstoppable interest in my bird, but high enough that I was not down on my knees for cleaning. The bird, for which I bought the cage,fits perfectly into the diamensions I did calculate correctly and is happily enjoying her new home. Overall, I would definitely say the cage was a good purchase and met my needs. However, there was one flaw as with most of the smaller cages it seems. On the sides that hook together, you may need to be a little persuasive as they may not clamp together like they should and therefore you may have to bend them a little to make sure they stay together. Otherwise you are going to start having issues and think that this cage is a piece of junk. By far it is not, it is just a typical wire bird cage. Therefore, it is great for small to medium size birds, but if you have a large to extra large bird, I strongly recommend finding a sturdier built bird cage.",1
Tiny and cheap,0
"This collar is amazing.  It shipped quickly.  After about a month I still have not had any problems.  It is easy to use, comes with a battery, and my puppy has stopped barking at everything.  It detects even growls and little quiet barks.  My dog is not instantly more calm and chilled out with this collar on.",1
"Do not buy, 2nd door I buy, they don't work right",0
I wish you could schedule repeating orders.,1
Cat wouldn't touch it. Looks like molasses.,0
"The weave on the straps is really loose, it would only take something small catching a loop of the web to warp it really bad. The straps are also very rough and lumpy, and the whole construction just doesn't feel sturdy. I was going to try it out, but my dog refused to walk when I put it on her. She's my model for The Dog Geek blog, and doesn't mind wearing sledding harnesses, mobility harnesses, tutus, or Halloween costumes. She minded this backpack, so I took her word for it and returned it.",0
"We've only used this a couple of times but it seems to work well for its intent. Normally we walk our dogs with two separate leashes, but on occasion a single leash would be handy.  This seems to be nicely constructed, and I like the stretch provided by the bungee.  Not too much stretch, but enough to relieve some pulling tension on me and the dogs.",1
These are NOT suitable for pets that chew! This more resembles a child's toy that comes out of a 50 cent machine. It comes apart and is not sturdy enough to stand against any nibbling.,0
"Crate was delivered onn the 20th of July. Today is the 27th. He's only been in the crate twice when i've come home. So i chained the door shut with a carabiner. O what does he do? He chewed a bar off and got out. I gave it two stars since obviously it was cheaply made, but if your dog isn't destructive, then it will work for you. ""Heavy duty steel frame, strong and durable."" No.... its not. Oh and my dog is a German Sheppard/Siberian Husky mix. 7 months old, 60lbs.",0
Recommended by my vet for a granuloma on my dog's paw. So far it seems to be shrinking the wound and there is a decrease in licking the wound.,1
"Got this filter for my 20 long. It seems to me that once these Aqueon filters settle and the pads get a bit dirty they really hold a lot of nitrifying bacteria. I would not have thought so because of the very simple design, but I think that the Aqueons are the filters that carry the bulk of the bio-load work on my tanks.

The Aqueon 20 and 10 seemed to do the same thing on the tanks at my children's school. Once they get settled they really seem to do the trick.",1
It says no fishy smell. This is so totally wrong. I have had to throw out two meals because the dogs will not touch it and the cat looked at me like I was crazy.,0
"I bought it and used it. The first thing I noticed was that it didn't smell like catnip. Instead the scent was mint-like. Perhaps there was some mistake. It got the cat's attention ,but not  in the way catnip does. I bought it so I feel it's on me but I wouldn't buy it again.",0
These keep your dogs teeth so clean without the mess of brushing them! Definitely going to keep buying,1
Not at all what they look like. They don't work.,0
"My dog seems to like it ok; it's the first toy she has seemed mildly interested in so far. (Only had her a week, only had the toy for 20 minutes)  However, after removing the toy from the packaging (cutting the dozen or so plastic ties and then digging the plastic ends out of the other side, which is an issue all in itself) I discovered that my particular squirrel had been burned at some point, all the way down to the backing.  I was luckily able to cut the burnt fur material off, so this squirrel now has a bald spot.  How did this pass QC?  Pretty sure dogs shouldn't be chewing on burned fake-fur material.",0
My pup enjoys having a bed in my bed.,1
"We just bought a 55 gallon aquarium and it came with 2 small packets of this stuff. We used them and quickly realized we would need a LOT of this in the future. I always check Amazon for prices and and reviews and ordered this bottle. I couldn't believe the size of it when it arrived. It is HUGE!!!! Well worth the money. We purchased a few other good deals so we could use the super shipper saving, which made this an even better deal. We saw a bottle in a pet store that was half this size and similar in price. Glad we ordered from Amazon!",1
"Im giving one star because of following:

1. Made  dog urine smell worse in carpet. Following all directions as bottle instructed.

2. It bleached my carpet when I put large amount on trouble spot that I wanted to soak down to pad as bottle instructed. Before I used on entire carpet, but watered done in carpet shampooer.
And carpet didn't get bleached.

3. When I used in my carpet machine I had to empty out waist water often, because there is large amount of suds. Its made for small spots and hand washing.

Im extremely disappointed with this product. I would have given a zero star if possible. It trashed my carpet ( SEE ATTACHED PICTURES)!!!! My carpet was perfect in color before this. It only took about five minutes for color to change. I rinsed for over a hour with clean water in carpet shampooer. I cryed my eyes out! I got repair estimated at $5000 to replace carpet. All carpet has to be replaced because cant find color match. And the stink of the product lingers in areas. Im shocked this is approved as a  urine cleaner. It totally does not get rid of the smell.",0
"This is a fantastic deal for ferret food. Honestly, the ferrets are going to eat the food anyways, so why waste all the money buying single bags over and over again at a local pet store. Just get it in bulk and use this. I haven't noticed the food getting stale either, as my ferrets are still as eager as ever to eat a fresh bowl of food.

I suppose if you wanted it to be at PEAK freshness you could simply open the bag up and divide it up into smaller bags. But again, no difference in the ferrets appeal to this food.",1
"It fits my dog very well, looks comfortable, and is easy to take on and off.",1
I received pkg. quickly and you have a great price on it. I have used Greenies for several years. my dogs love them. Thanks for the bargain!,1
hamster loved it,1
"My outdoor cats used them all through this bitter cold winter when temps were below 0.  Even the scraggly ones with patchy fur survived by using these A frames.  They are easy to assemble and work like a charm.  Thank you, K&H Manufacturing.",1
The handle doesn't stay locked and allows the litter box to sway scaring the cats trying to use it. Now they have quit using it.,0
Good quality food I use to feed my dogs.,1
"It dose its job, but can't fit my faucet even I ordered separate part from Python cost me 10 buck, still can't fit.
Went to local hardware store, they help me find the right part and cost me 2 buck. If you have new faucet, think if you can get the right brass or adaptor before jump to this product, or you get real trouble",0
Very easy to put together. My Monk loves it.,1
Pulled 2 ticks off 1 week later! I'll order from vets in the future.,0
Cheap looking and the food does not fall down like it is supposed to. I had to keep pulling it down.,0
"Handle is too flimsy, thing broke after 5 weeks!",0
My fussy girl loves it!,1
"5 lbs of ths sand mixed with 15 lbs of fish rock and 3 lbs of organic soil on top of a heating rope make for very happy geckos, roaches, and meal worms. the sand retains heat very well. I'm able to grow live plants in my mix. very happy! :)",1
"Not as good as I would have thought :-(.  This spray is very oily which concerns me as to what other products are in there.  Also, I have a very short haired dog, but it is still difficult to work the spray into the skin.  I use the shampoo and leave in treatment and that's all that is needed.  If your dog starts itching again, just save your $$$, mix a little water with the leave in treatment, and that does the trick just fine!",0
"Very Sturdy and durable. I bought two, and have owned them for almost 2 years. They are outside under my patio cover and still look new. My large male and mini Russian Blue sleep together inside the pagoda house. They like the tight enclosure. Minimal carpet loss with all the nail sharpening and easy to hand vacuum.",1
"Have 3 disagreeable little dogs next door, Bought this hoping it would slow down their barking. They do not seem to be reacting to anything and no decrease in barking.",0
Some of the best dog food. Nice to be able to order on-line instead of driving 40 miles to get it!,1
Doesn't work. My dog still eating its own poop.,0
Was hard to get it to blow bubbles when it did blow the cats loved it and chased them. But it was so difficult to get it to even blow any bubbles that I ended up throwing it away,0
Didn't even last a week! Very poorly made!!!! WILL NOT buy another one!,0
"These are great!  Cheaper then most, and bigger then the ones you can find on the store worhout paying an arm and a leg.",1
"I have a 9 pound Maltese poodle mix and he fits perfectly in the XS. Its really nice quality and super cute, I will definitely buy another when more designs are available!",1
"Bought this using the Amazon app so I didn't really see the reviews (like I usually do). Looked good and thought this would be a great upgrade from the Petmate plastic scoop we have  and love but is now broken.

However, it wasn't. It's a mess. Rather than fully repeat what another reviewer wrote, let me point you to the 1-star review by Steven L. Scott. He captures exactly what we thought when we received this scoop.

Honestly, awful. Mr. Scott is spot on when he points out that the metal neck barely extends up into the handle. This means the handle is way too flexible. And that means if you're scooping a large load and are not careful that large load gets flung. An utter mess. Just like this scoop.

1 star.",0
I was expecting a half empty bag like that you would receive hmafter buying chips but this was filled to the top with treats. My dogs seemed enjoy them very much and last longer than expected for two dogs.,1
If you have indoor cats.. this works great for those little mishaps,1
"It is REALLY small....7 inches across by maybe 6 inches tall...some of the reviews said it was much larger...
someone had it in  a 110 gallon.....my tank is 55 and this would get lost in the plants....maybe a 10 gallon
tank...",0
Has not worked for us.,0
The rats love them. So glad there are two! I like the variety of treats inside and knowing the crunchiness is helping with their teeth. Will definitely be ordering again,1
"I'm not sure if I was doing something wrong, but even putting this product on my dog made it look like it was plugged into a 240volt outlet.

I really should have video'd it, but was worried I'd be called upon by Animal Services. This was just in my house. I thought if I took the dog for a walk, it would pay more attention to the surroundings. 10 feet into the walk, people were stopping on the street asking why I was abusing my dog.

I returned it and got a full refund. Probably just my dog as I have numerous friends that use these types of collars and they all swear by them, but my dog would have nothing to do with it. At least Amazon was really good about returning it and getting me my money back",0
"Oh the treats are definitely tasty. Most dogs love them. After reading the ingredients I noticed it had propylene glycol which is a toxin.  It helps keep the treats moist. The FDA  allows it to be used for a lot of different products. This chemical can cause liver and kidney problems. Look it up in Google and I bet you will not feed this to your dog much longer. Your better off feeding your dog scraps off the table than give your pet dog food that is full of additives that are harmful. My Beagle is 14 years old and eats, hamburger meat, steaks, pork chops, carrots, apple, strawberries, peanuts and I not so nave to think some of our own food have bad things in them like insecticide. Just be careful...",0
"I used these a few times and am throwing the rest away because they dried out quickly even in the sealed box. I didn't find that they cleaned or deodorized well at all. They might work for an extremely small dog, but if you have any dog bigger than a shoe box, or are looking to solve odor problems, you might as well bite the bullet and shampoo them. These are a waste of money.",0
"Originally prescribed for gastro problems which my cat recovered from.  I still try to keep her close to the vet-prescribed food which she quickly tires of.  With this sprinkled on the food she is enthusiastic about food she turned away from minutes ago, so it must taste great to her as well as being a nutritious probiotic.",1
Kinda feel like after 7 months this shouldnt have happened.,0
"This is not a collar for your dog to wear as a primary collar. I keep it hooked on to my dogs leash. It tightens up and won't allow him to slip out of collar if startled,while remaining loose enough for comfort. If you leave a martingale on in the house or yard,the collar can get caught on something and hang your dog.",1
"This seemed to work pretty good.  The smell is also something that is too strong, but pretty pleasant.  Hopefully I won't need to use it very often!",1
"It looked good on my pup for the first few days, but then it started rolling and completely lost its look and appearance. Its made of very cheap material that doesnt hold its shape and probably costs no more than 10 cents to make. Anyways, a picture is worth a thousand words! I haven't even washed it yet. Complete garbage!",0
Love it. Easy to use and monitor.,1
Too much pressure on my neck. My dog weighs 12 pounds and this is awkward. Probably best for tiny tea cup dogs. I will be returning this.,0
"Growing Newfoundland puppy loves this toy! He is about 100 pounds now and from day 1 has loved getting treats out of it. I will stuff it with canned food and then freeze it for a more difficult play session. He doesn't sit down and chew the toy-he knows to flip and roll it. I imagine if you have a dog that would chew rubber to get at the treat inside, this might not be for you.
It does get hairy and kinda gross, but easily cleans up with hot water.",1
Monkey dead in minutes,0
I bought this at Petsmart it is horrible I've never ever had such an odor in my house.  The theory is awesome. But reality is pee gets on the litter some and it smells the poop is unable to clump so my kitty can't cover it we clean it the minute he goes tried changing the pad daily to twice daily still stinks.  No way to control odor. Don't buy this product.  For the ones that said they loved it they must have the cat in another area of the home like miles away. Don't believe it it stinks' poor cat spent so much time trying to cover the poop even when there is none there!,0
Great pump and waterflow for the money. It's pretty strong for it's compact size and has a magnetic mount which is easy to install. The only pump that I found to be more compact and of better quality is the Sicce XStream which is much more expensive.,1
"It does not stay on the door and gets caught in the door as the door closes.  It is generally a good idea, but bad execution.  It would have worked much better if it had a pre-bend portion and a keyhole-type hanger so it actually stayed on.  I would not buy again.",0
this bed is so cheaply made.  I could not believe when I received the item how flat it was and how cheaply it was made.  It was a waste of time ordering.  I would never expect my dog to sleep on something so cheaply made.  I should of known by the pricing. Returning for full refund.,0
"My only reasoning for not giving this product five stars is because the first time I used it, it did not rotate properly to feed my cat. Only half of the feeding area was exposed making it hard for my cat to eat from. After several rotations it did get on track though and work fine. It is nice to use when we are out of town for a couple of nights. I used it for my kitten to ensure he didn't gorge himself and to make sure his little tummy got two meals a day. I would like to use it for my two older cats but I'm afraid my one piggy cat would eat from both before my other could get there in time.",1
Leaks oil all over floor... so if a cat peeing doesnt ruin your floor then this will.,0
Best thing i ever bought !!! No more food issues between my three kitties.,1
"I was using the feeder socks, which the finches loved, but was wasting a lot of expensive seed. This feeder is wonderful. It will pay for itself in seed savings. The finches struggled initially with the seed ports, so I expanded them very slightly. Within 15 minutes, they were back to try it again and they love it. Now the feeder is swamped with finches and here are 6 feeding as I write. Great product so far!",1
"Works great, exactly what I expected!",1
Cheap and comes apart.,0
"We had been wondering for 6 years what Reggie was.  Finally I did this for one of my husband's Christmas presents.  I was dumbfounded by the results.  I thought for sure my dog had to be half doxie;
really suprised by the half aussie shephard.  It was fun and I would recommend it to anyone with an adopted stray like us!",1
The large fit our airedale perfectly.  We and our dog love it!,1
"I thought it would be a soft pillow type toy, but it's hard plastic. There's no way for a cat to toss it, as far as I can tell, in the way they'd toss a soft toy, and what else would you do with a fish toy but chew it and toss it? Guess you could bat it about, but the other problem is that my cat is totally uninterested in it, while she's nuts over her other Silvervine toys. Not impressed is my verdict. I wish the ""plastic"" notation was more prominently placed in the description. Also, I'm not finding where it says it's not returnable. All together, I'm not happy and will buy nothing further from Vitakraft.",0
"Perhaps this product works -- I'll never know.  It makes my cats smell like over-applied cheap perfume (my wife thinks urinal cakes are a better description) and impossible to be near.  As a bonus, my cats sat and cleaned themselves all day when wearing it, like some sort of compulsion.

This was perfect for our dog. who was eating too fast. This definitely help him to slow down on his eating.,1
My dog loves these pill pockets. She usually eats her meds without complaining but there is one specific medication she absolutely hates and refuses to eat and these pill pockets come in very handy and she seems to love the taste. Thank you!,1
My dog has not chewed on anything that has been sprayed. I did not experience any bitter taste in my mouth when spraying- as others have mentioned in their reviews.,1
"My puppy destroyed this thing in one day, the squecker was torn from its body well before the frog was decapitated. do not buy for dogs.",0
I ordered 3 different LED collars to put on my dog at night so we don't step on him when he's sleeping.  This is the only good one.  The light stays bright all night long and then some.  I would say it stays lit for about 12 hours on a full charge.,1
"I saw this food scoop at The container store, it was too cute that I had to buy although I already have another one. This food scoop is very cute and works well. It holds one cup and easy to hang with the small hole on the handle or just simply put it in the bag. Material seems durable and there are no sharp edges or smelly.",1
Terrible quality and ill fitting.,0
Good,1
"None of the Frontline products work. My groomer and vet have confirmed that it's a huge waste of money. I used it on my 6 dogs and 1 cat and they still had fleas. Do not buy this, you will be disappointed!",0
Doesn't work! :(,0
"Went to Petco looking for replacement football for the one we lost.(not Kong but my dog loved it) Have always bought Kong toys for their quality.
They had a couple of each size, small, medium, and large, but not one of them squeaked. Because I had always been very satisfied with Kong toys before, I assumed somehow the footballs were damaged in the store.
Went home and ordered a size small and a size medium football for my 23 month old Shih tzu because I didn't know which size was best for him. He loves to play fetch with squeak toys. However, he is not a heavy chewer on his toys, just enough to make them squeak.
The medium is too large for him to pick up but he seems to have a blast rolling it around with his nose. We have had it 1 day and it still squeaks when we squeeze it.
But, the small football stopped squeaking after about 5 tosses.
It angers me to watch my dog do his best to make that thing squeak. He brings it to me and scratches my arm to get me to make it squeak. (I think this is why he brings it to me) The football is small and cute but I ordered it because it was supposed to squeak.
I'm out over $15 on these 2 toys. I know buying the medium size one is my fault. Just not a Kong quality toy.",0
"These are the most fickle electronic pet pads I've purchased. Waste of money. Def will use PetSafe again in the future. One beeps constantly, the other worked for a while...and now it beeps constantly. The cats are peeing on the mat. I wish I could say better things about this product but feel I wasted $60. So much better use for the money --- like donation to a humane society where it would really do some good! I may shop locally just so I can return these mats in the future. I wonder, too, if the optional electrical connection would facilitate a better performance. Who knows.",0
Do not waste your money!!!! After day two collar and remote would not sync. Horrible customer service. Very very disappointed!!!! Piece of junk!!!,0
"My pug is kind of terrified of them, but has gone up when bribed with treats.
The stairs themselves are not as sturdy as some of the block stairs I've seen,

be put up here, which is good!",1

Dogs LOVED it!,1
Not for an active dog. He kept getting out bc its not as deep as it looks in the picture,0
Gave my dog diarrhea,0
Our regular poop bag store went out of business and these are a very good replacement at a good price. Works in freezing weather and does not leak even when melted snow gets accidentally picked up.  I also have a habit of throwing the poop bag over our fence to pick up later and there have been no poop bag explosions so far.,1
Glad the legs are attached separately. We needed it for a mobile grooming service. with no legs.,1
These are my dogs favorite treats! He has a sensitive stomach and they do not seem to bother him.,1
"Love these and will continue to buy them until my 3 male squirt guns pass on.  We could not train our 3 males to stop marking in the house!  These are wonderful!!  All 3 of our males are Doberman's the smallest is 65 pounds the largest is 100 pounds and this size works on all 3.  The marking is stopped and when the older male(who is 12) has an accident these diapers capture the entire bladder dump without leaking, they are super easy to put on and the velcro is heavy duty so they stay on.  We love these and are very thankful they are not only available but in 3 colors so I can make sure each one of our males uses the same diaper, also these wash very well in the washing machine I have dried them in the dryer and out on our clothes line.  If you are looking for a solution for an incontinent older dog or males who mark this is your tool!",1
I bought this harness based on a review from another happy shopper. This harness is great. I love it and it is great protection for my elderly lab. It is a great product at a great price. I highly recommend this harness to anyone looking to buy. I will be purchasing two more for my other fur babies.,1
"My puppy Loved it. Chewed it right off Large pieces, small pieces and I think she ate some of it.",0
"Excellent product, great price, many colors to chose from, and fast service. I love this toy. Every cat should have one. I bought two and my cats went bonkers. Great for kittens and older cats. Thank you!",1
My dog loves this product!,1
"I like the material, very durable and inviting. But it hardly makes any noise at all-very disappointing. Just like a pricey regular ball. Would not buy it again. Bought the Babble Ball and the dogs love it.",0
This product works great for our Maltese.  The package was dropped at the wrong building!!!!,1
first shoes I have ever got to stay on my boston terrier they are easy to put on,1
Perfect for my pooch! Easy to put on and works as expected,1
"My puppy was in the kennel for no more than 5 minutes and she had already chewed a hole into this crate pad. It seems to me K9 Ballistics knows they have a sub par product because they only offer either a replacement cover for the pad, a 50% refund for the pad, or 50% off another product. Why would I have a replacement sent if she is just going to do the same thing, and why would I wan't 50% off another product if this is the quality of their ""Durable beds""",0
"Much smaller than I thought, even with the measurements. I have a dwarf bunny, and she doesn't like being couped up in it. I can't imagine a regular sized bunny living in it. Its very nice, I just wish it was wider for her.",0
"My dog had the collar on for 10 minutes, it went off 5 times and she never even made a noise to make it go off. I bought 2 collars, 1 for each of my dogs and thought maybe just 1 collar was defective but as soon as I put the second collar on my dog it did the same exact thing. Already contacted Amazon for a refund and they were very accommodating. Love Amazon's customer service, very disappointed in these collars.",0
"Did not think it worked that well,went to the vet and got medicine",0
not worth it water still ucky,0
"I bought this [a Med.] for my jenday conure.  I can't see a smaller parakeet using it as I can put it inside what's left of the one he has, which was purchased at a local pet store.  The description says it should fit for conures, caiques, etc.  IMHO only if they're midgets!!  I will try a large next.  Hopefully that will work as he loves his ""sleep tent"".  Now if he would just stop chewing them up!",0
Great bed! Strong enough to handle our 50 lb dog jumping on it,1
Caps work great on my dogs nails. It you want to protect your floors this is a great investment! I have 4 stars because I have used other brands that seems to stay on longer and not wear but you need to take them off after a few weeks anyway.,1
"I do believe there is a difference in ""stability"" stand-point from the medium to the large - large is much sturdier & better built for any dog over 40lbs.

While others have stated that the medium is sufficient for dogs up to 50-60lbs, I personally don't believe it's suitable for any dog over 40lbs because after having both medium & large delivered to the house, the large is much better built for any dog weighing more then 40lbs.

so if you have a dog between 40-70lbs, definitely opt for the large you will not regret it. I have a small house with 2 large dogs, one whom is 50lbs that I thought I could get away with getting a medium, but her legs drape off the edges.",1
"Great little step through harness. Now while the ad says it's made of mesh, I think it's important to note that it's made of a padded mesh... that it's thicker than just a thin flimsy mesh material. Really great quality. It connects with velcro at the top. But it also has a another secure plastic buckle there also. In case you have a rambunctious dog this will prevent it from just slipping away if the velcro comes undone. Unfortunately, with one of my dog's he is very sensitive and jumpy, and the rattling that the plastic buckle makes gives him some stress when we walk and when he jumps. Still this is an extremely high-quality item. I am very pleased with how fast it was sent, with how well this item was made and with how well it works.",1
uncomfortable to hold. the fabric is not at all flexible.,0
Had to cut it to fit. If it wasn't for my husband being a handy man we would have returned it and bought a whole new unit at lowes home improvement.,0
Excelente!,1
"I purshased the dog bowl set in hopes of keeping a little dog out of the big dogs food but that didn't exactly happen. The bowls and stand look much nicer than the previous dog dishes. Easy to clean, aesthetically pleasing, and sturdy stand. Tall enough for the big dog (boxer) to comfortably eat out of but not quite tall enough to keep out the Frenchie.",1
"The first collar was bad but a replacement was sent quickly.

My dog was quite a barker and it seemed to be getting worse. The collar really shuts her down BUT it sometimes beeps (quite loudly!) at inopertune times like, when she bites a biscuit, I don't recommend walking your dog with a leash and this collar; we don't. It works but might over correct the behavior. I wish the sensitivity was adjustable.",1

This stopped working after a few hours of the 1st time used! It was fully charged! Waste of money!!!,0
I opened these and the smell was just horrible.  These are my dogs favorite treats...but obviously rancid and spoiled.  Unfortunately they are not able to be returned due to Amazon's return policy.,0

As long as my cat enjoys them, I will keep buying them.",1
Just didn't work. In 3 weeks he had fleas. I don't get it. I guess you get what you pay for.... Just trying to save a buck cost me more. We were disappointed and will stick with the leading brand,0
My dog is getting older and wouldnt eat his dry food anymore. The vet recommended this and it works great. My dog now eats all his food.,1
made cheap,0
Our dogs like these and they are made of good products,1
My dog is obsessed with this ball and she has not destroyed it. She loves her chew toys but few hold up once she gets hold of them,1
It worked fine when I tested it as the directions(which were for a collar the took a diff type of battery) said. You rub the contacts on a rough surface. Put it on my dog and he barked consistently throughout the day. I never once heard the collar beep.,0
"Good-looking dog collar, what the size is way off.  Cannot recommend until the sizing issue is addressed.",0
"Perfect for my snorkie puppy! Plenty of space for his bed, toys & room to run around and play. He loves spending time in it & it keeps him contained when I can't directly watch him. I love that it's portable and I can easily move it from room to room or wherever we go!",1
Product does NOT work and does not fit as depicted in the pic.  Waste of money.,0

"I used to buy a salmon oil from my local health food store, however it was a bit expensive for such a small bottle Found this online and read many reviews before buying.  It's great.  Lasts longer than what I had been buying and provides the same great positive effects on my dogs.  Their coats are soft, shiny, healthy.  And they love the taste,  The best part: No smell.  The salmon oil I was buying had a fishy smell and lingered on hands if you happened to get some there.  This has no smell at all",1

"It is somewhat sturdy but the first time they shipped it, it was deffective so i had to spend another two weeks to get the cage because they had to refund me and then re order one. But the locks suck and are super easy for an adventurous dog to get out of. She keeps getting out still so i will need to purchase padlocks which suck bc I spent 170 dollars on a cage and the doors are easy to open for a dog.",0
"This is the 3rd door I've purchased from PetSafe, and I really have no problem with these doors. Sometimes, no matter how well you install these doors, the flap doesn't close all the way and seal properly, which can be a problem in the winter. Here's how to remedy the problem. Go to Harbor Freight and buy a pack of 2 small ceramic block magnets item #97504 for a buck. Glue these magnets with super glue or Gorilla glue, one on each side of the lower outdoor side of the door flap so that when your pet comes back inside, the flap lands against the magnets and seals perfectly. If you play around with this idea you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Note that you'll have an air gap in the flap the width of the magnets when the dog is outdoors . . but when he comes back in, the flap will land against the magnets and make a perfect seal every time. If your dog spends 90% of his time indoors like mine do, this is a great cheap fix that could save you some bucks on your energy bill.",1
"Absolutely love this! I have two dogs that shed horribly and this keeps the seats clean, and its much easier to clean off when needed. Plus the dogs love it.",1
My dogs did not like this item.  The pads did not fit well.,0
"I bought this training shock collar for the boxer mix puppy I rescued from Puerto Rico. He is an avid, all four feet on the counter surfer, but more importantly he is aggressive towards my 2 cats. I chose the SportDog Brand SD-350 YardTrainer in hopes of changing these negative behaviors.
I'm really disappointed I spent so much money ($149.00 at the time) on this training collar and that I didn't realize earlier that it was not the quality product I was led to believe it was from the advertising. This trainer hasn't had hard use (as in everyday). On occasion, I could tell the dog received the warning or shock, but mostly I couldn't tell and was left wondering. Or when I really needed it to work, it didn't and I could tell because his ""bad"" behavior continued.
In the year I have had this trainer, the charging lights have only changed from red to green indicating it was fully charged TWICE and that took 2 full days and nights.  I now know this training collar is not holding a charge and is defective. I really wish I had sent it back, but I doubted myself and thought maybe I was not plugging the charging plugs in correct side up.
So, believe the negative reviews and save yourself a lot of money and buy a quality trainer.  I wish I had.",0
This company has delivered in every conceivable way! We are 100% satisfied with this product & results!! We totally recommend this company & product!!,1
"This is the best dog toy I have ever had. We fill our kong with peanut butter, so we have to wash it a bit. I was doing the dishes, and turned on the trash disposal to hear a weird, bumping noise. I turned off the disposal, reached in, and pulled out... the kong, but with not a mark on it! It must have been in the disposal for 5-10 seconds, running, and there was nothing wrong with it! It still looks new! I know my garbage disposal can do more damage than my puppy. This thing will last forever!",1
Great size for my cat who refuses to go into and goes crazy when I try to put him in a standard hard cat carrier. It made the trip to the vet much easier! Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it does hold it's shape very well.,1
This litter really is by far the best iv found pared with a good mat the litter stays where it belongs love this litter,1
"Its cheap and its worth it if you think your cat might have a remote interest in it. I bought this because I work a lot and wanted something ""fun"" for my cat to play with while I was away. I don't know how often he uses it when I am at work, but he does run across when I coax him in with toys. He sleeps inside of it too . My kitty is a big boy at 16 lbs so not everything works for us, but he was able to fit in this one just fine.

update:
We are now two months in and kitty uses this almost daily. I am still working long days and leave the tunnel of in the middle of the living room while I am away. I thought it might be a suffocation hazard of some sort (kitty is a big guy) but he and the tunnel are perfectly fine and well suited for one another imo. Also, the entire thing is still intact! no holes, no wires poking out, no loose strings... quite a shock coming from this cat household.",1
This product is cheaply made. It doesn't go all the way up to the bed. I am not going to use it for my dogs because I am afraid they'll get injured because it gives to any amount of weight.,0

"My two male guinea pigs are picky about hay cubes--I've tried various brands, and the boys will usually take the cubes to their respective houses and then leave them untouched for days (I finally toss them out). With these cubes, so far, so good--they've actually been nibbling at them, which is progress. I want to make sure they have something to gnaw on that is healthy and will prevent their teeth from overgrowing. I want my piggies to remain healthy and happy, and these certainly are a great supplement to their main diet.",1
I have a 105lb year old German Shepherd/Great Pyrenees mix. He's a monstrous chewer. This lasted about 2 weeks. He did enjoy it though.,0
"This product is not worth it.  The rings are too shallow to work with.  You end up with massive mess of litter on the floor as well as cat stuff where they miss.  Cleaning the ring is a nightmare. It has ridges you must dump the litter out daily and scooping whats stuck is very difficult.  At the end my kitties were not impressed and neither of them were successful at being potty trained.  The truth is that this product is flawed from inception.  We wil try again with a home made device based on ""The Toilet Trained Cat"" idea and if that fails we will move on to the ""Cat Genie"". I do have clients who are fairly satisfied with the Cat Genie; teh downfall to that system is the plastic litter sticks to the cats paws and is quite messy all over the house.  Also its expensive and often malfunctions and won't work in the malfunctioned stage.  So there are problems with every system its all in what you can live with.  I don't like the mess of litter on the floor so we will proceed with our next adventure.

I do not recommnend the litter Kwitter at all its a waste of money for a device that has a high failure rate and quite a mess.",0
"This item would be wonderful if only they hasd not put the very sticky & HARD to remove sticker on it!  I nearly rubbed a HOLE in it trying to get that thing OFF with solvents, warm water & soap.  It keeps my cat warm, & she likes it, and that is the only freason I'm not just giving ONE star!  It took me 2 hours to get that sticker OFF!!",0

"The Waggabee bark collar shipped very fast. When I got it, I immediately put it on the charger. After 4 hours, I checked on it. It did not work. I charged it over night, it still did not work! I watched the video and had other family members try to figure it out. The product instructions talk about being able to test it. That didn't work at all. Their Head Sales Consultant does sent out emails about tips and he even includes the instruction video. However, I replied to the email and they asked me a question and never got back with me. I've seen another post on here saying that theirs didn't work either, so I guess I wasn't the only one.",0
Very strong. Tines are close enough together to hold clumps but far enough apart to drain well. We have two cats and they make urine clumps as big as my fist. This scoop is stronger than I am. I push with all my weight against it to get the stubborn stuff out without tearing it up. Works excellently. Would gladly buy it again.,1
"We purchased a different brand of soft collar in medium, but it was just a bit too tight on our big dog. Got this one in large and the third notch out is perfect for his 20"" neck. This is super well made, and the padding extends beyond the top layer of the collar so the padding is what is 1.25"" wide. Our dog is very comfortable in it. Very attractive as well. A separate small ring for his tag would be nice. I would buy this collar again!",1
"Good weight, bounce and durability.  The darker color doesn't look as nasty as a yellow tennis ball after our dog plays with it in the yard.",1

"We have a 13 month old huskie/retriever mix.  I would not recommend this toy for a medium size breed dog.  It has a squeaker but no staying power.  Our dog destroyed in in 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, I bought two.  If I return the unused toy my refund would be $1.65 via UPS.  So be aware you will pay for return shipping.  For that refund I'd spend more in gas going to UPS.",0
"I bought this product a couple months ago and I was hoping to see a change in my cat in that she would eventually like it. WRONG. Each time I fed this to her, she threw up later in the day. I made sure to test whether or not it was this food directly affecting her and after not feeding it to her and only giving her Iams dry food, the upset stomach subsided. I even went to the extent of going a few weeks without giving it to her and then slowly introducing it again. What do you know, once I gave it to her, I came home to cleaning up puke.
I used the subscribe and save feature and ended up spending over $90 just to find out that it upsets her stomach each time she eats it. I bought two 24 packs of the chicken flavor, one 24 pack of the Ocean Fish and one 24 pack of the Tuna.
After her first vet visit, the vet recommended switching her over to a healthier cat food. I took her recommendation of Hill's Science Diet and bought a couple cans of these same exact flavors at Petco. She loved them, which then made me order in bulk on Amazon. What's the worst that could go wrong right? If she liked the same exact thing that I bought at Petco, why wouldn't she like these? Never did it cross my mind that she would stick her nose up at them or end up getting sick. I am very upset. $90 down the drain!!! Instead of throwing them out I had considered giving them to my local pet shelter, but I don't want to chance getting those poor animals sick as well.",0
"The chickens will not hold still long enough for me to brush their teeth...

"I love these Harnesses for my little Minpin - They are super cute and look like they would be very comfy for her to wear.  The first Harness that I bought her ever (this year) was from a local pet store, it cost  a fortune much more than I paid for these and it was a mess trying to figure out how to put it on her.  After what seemed like forever I finally got it around her neck, and snapped shut on both straps.  I thought I'd let her wear it for a bit and see how she took to it.  When I went back into the living room where she was playing after I strapped the basic harness into place,  I was shocked to see the thing hanging off her, I thought maybe the clasp had come undone what a shock to see that she had chewed through the front strap of the harness.  What a waste of money, and I was all ready to take her for a walk around the block.  I was going to buy her another harness forget even trying to get the pet store to replace it because it was very obvious what had happened and the strap was about an inch wide.  Later that same evening I went on line to see what Amazon might have to offer, at least I can take my time looking and not feel too disappointed when there was really nothing  better than the Harness I had orginally bought her to choose from at the pet store.
I bought two of these one in the Blue and the other in Pink plaid, they arrived today in less than a week after placing my order.  I love them, they are adorable, well made, soft and very, very easy to put on the Pet.  I intend to purchase a few more for her tonight.  I did buy the matching leashes, and they have not come yet.
It is very, very simple to put on your Pet, only  one adjustment to make and snap shut.  Her head goes through the hole in the front of the Harness, no strap around her neck and she can't chew through this one.  They are so adorable I can hardly wait to take her to my daughter's tomorrow night.  She will want to get her pets one too, I'm betting on that one.
Also the one I bought from the pet store cost $19.95 not to mention tax, plus my time just to end up tossing it into the trash.

Some people here have said that they are too small, mine fit my dog  just perfectly, however ""not"" a lot of room left over after the initial adjustment on the strap with the closure. My Dog is a Minpin, 2 years old, weighing about 13 to 14 pounds.  I am glad that I went with a Medium Size, and not the Small.  I don't imagine that she will grow any bigger so these should last a very, very long time for her.  The section of the Harness that her head slips through is not tight, and it's not too big.  I say for her it fits just perfect. I am very pleased with the quality, design and price not to mention the ease of adjusting the harness and putting it on my dog.  She will be the cutie on the block wearing these that's for sure.  They are very well made, and the price is actually cheaper than if I purchased one from the pet store and that's taking the price of shipping into consideration.
I highly recommend this product.  They are just a heart throb on your dog!",1
This was too small for my 12 pound cat but I shoved him in and made the best of it. Overall it was ok however it didn't seem very well made and it stunk terribly like chemicals when it arrived. It had to sit it out in the garage before I could use it.,0

This ramp is a keeper.  I returned one ramp because it didn't reach our tall bed and seemed unstable.  This ramp makes it so easy for our French Bull dog to get on bed or off without fear of her jumping off the wrong way and injuring herself.  I would buy again and recommend to others.,1

"I brought this as a ""I'm going to miss you when I go away to college"" present for my dog. She's a 12ish pound Pomeranian/Toy American Eskimo Mix.

She likes chewing on it and she LOVES all the squeakers (it has six, all her other squeak toys only have one). It's also super cute. 5 stars.",1
Boo Boo loves it. Need to buy 2nd one because he doesn't like waiting the 15 minutes to cool down. Boo Boo is 256 lbs and thinks it needs to be 50 degrees in the house or car.

I like the ingredients in this brand. before I used to feed them purina one true Instinct and my little Maltese mix would pick out all these soft bites.

The chart says that the large-size neck is 13""~15"", but the neck size on the large-size harnesses I received is 17""-22"" (the neck size is not adjustable, and widens from 17"" in the front to 22"" in the back by tape measure). For some reason, the vendor doesn't use the regular Amazon return system, so I created an account and contacted the vendor by email to exchange these harnesses for the right size. Their first response was that I could return the items with a copy of the Amazon invoices, and they would waive the restocking fee and issue a credit. I could then order a smaller size. Duh, I replied, that would make me pay the shipping fees twice. They saw my point and agreed in their next email. This looks like a good company to work with.",1

"It's pretty much ""Meh."" Dog comes in. Dog goes out. After hundreds of enterings and exitings, dog trips and falls while entering. Flimsy plastic housing breaks, and I get to try to fix it. Unsolicited Advice: If you choose to buy and install this item, don't use the worthless mounting hardware it comes with. Use drywall anchors and wood screws and maybe some 1 x 4 pine to frame around the hole. The 2 mm brittle plastic doesn't hold up to much stress. The white part visible in the picture is, in fact, aluminum, but the rest of it seems to be made from a century old batch of bakolite. If you have any carpentry skills, don't follow their instructions to the letter. Use your squares and levels the way you know you should. Overall, if you're willing to put in the extra work, I recommend it. The flaps do a good job of keeping the weather outside.",0

"I wish I could have found this in a wider size but I really love this leash with the matching collar.  It's very soft and even has all the rhinestones.  :-)  Unfortunately Dora chewed the leash to pieces about a week after I got it so I just this minute ordered another one.  Thanks for reminding me to order a replacement, lol.",1
"I have a 1-year old male malamute who stands as high as a mini horse...he is tall, gazel-like and very strong when he sets his mind to it.  He weighs 103 pounds, lean muscle, and very easy to train.  His strength has maxed my red flexi retractable many the times and the leash is a wee bit over 1year old, and just now getting tougher to retract.  I will try the idea of another writer and retract and lock and dry it over night to see if that helps.  This model is one of few reasonably priced that can handle my 103 pound dog reliably.  Highly recommend to anyone",1
My puppy doesn't go near it.,0
Cheap construction. Holes at least 6X6. Long grass hay fell through. Livestock got heads stuck in bag due to extremely large holes. Tried for one day. Extremely dissatisfied. Pretty color.,0
It is much easier to buy this from amazon and have it shipped to the house than trekking the pet store to purchase the same thing. No issues with faulty cans or discolored food like some previous reviewers. The expiration date on the package is always at least 6+ months from when I receive the cans. We've been ordering exclusively from amazon for a few months now and my kittens certainly can't tell a difference.,1

Stairs  are not very strong. Dogs feel wobbly when they use them. Certainly not good for bigger dogs under 50 pounds.,0
Waste of Money!!!!!!  I bought three for my three large dogs - all different but this is the bulkiest.  Last for all three less than 5 minutes.  Like taking $15 and flushing it down the toilet.  Buy a box of milk bones - it is better for the dog and will last much longer.,0
"Let's be clear, this is not a ""throw it and forget it"" kind of toy...this is INTERACTIVE.  If you've got a chewer at all, this is the toy you get out when you're ready to play TOGETHER.  That has *nothing* to do with the quality of the toy, it just is what it is...an aggressive chewer will destroy any fabric toy with a quickness if you LET them chew it.
Now that that's settled, my two LOVE this toy!  They're both big dogs (55 and 85lbs), chewers and tough on toys.  This is one of those toys they only get to play with for as long as chasing it and getting the chipmunks out holds their interest.  As soon as they start gnawing on tails, it goes back in the closet.  I usually get a good 20-30mins with them before they go there though and they love playing with the stump as much as the toys.  Yes, the smart one figured it out in seconds but she LOVES to bring me all the toys to stuff back into the stump so she can go again.  The brawn-before-brain pup takes a lot longer but it delights him too.",1
Good kennel,1
My Kitties did not like it.,0
"The info on Amazon states this is 36.25 in. x 20.5 in. in size when it is really just 20 in x 17 in as it says on the box, but the photo on the site is so blurry you can't see this size.  I had to return it as it doesn't fit the large covered litter box sold at PetSmart.",0
Great product they must taste good because my dog loved them. Will buy again,1
"Very cute and standard poop bag holder. The key ring was a bit small for our leash, but they also provided another handle with a velcro strap and that works very well. The bags were a little difficult to get open at first, even though they do have an ""open here"" section on the top. You have to use a finger on each side of bag, and crinkle it, to get it to open. It took me a few tries. Overall, a good value for the money :) I'd recommend!",1
Most of the crystals fell out within a few days. I returned it. Looks cheap too. Don't bother.,0
Good product. I've tried a bunch of basking docks for my turtle and this is the best so far. Nice clean design makes it easy to clean. Only 4 stars cause the gripping material has started to peel off a bit,1
"Two of my three cats won't eat these when empty. Naturally it's the healthy one that likes it as a treat, but that doesn't help the sick ones.",0
"My bigger dog loved it. She usually starts to chew and rip apart her beds. However, with this one she's had it for over a month and its in perfect shape. So I choose to buy one for each of my smaller dogs. Now they all have matching beds and they are easy to wash.",1
It took a couple of days for the plate to mold to our dog's chest but once it did there were no issues.  He is a big puller so this is working out great for him to pull us on our hikes.  He seems to like it as well because he is no longer being choked when we hike.,1
My dog is obsessed with this toy! He even tries to take it on walks. Hoping it lasts awhile as he is an avid chewer!,1
Good concept.  But cat won't go near it.  I don't know why.,0
"Wonderful product, works exactly as advertised and as you would hope. I couldn't have a dog in my apartment without it. Except:

1) I ordered the biggest one for my tiny chihuahua, and it's just right for her. I can't imagine trying it for a bigger dog. They need to walk around a little.
2) If the poop is even slightly wet, cleaning the ""grass"" can be a hassle. Better than having to leave work to walk the dog, though!

Update: I've found that a pretty effective way to clean the grass from time to time is to just put it in the bathtub and let the shower run on it for about ten minutes, turning as needed.",1
Expensive Junk ! stopped working after 4months....you've been warned.,0
Our cat doesn't like the texture. Maybe your cat does.,0
Do not buy this collar.  Both of my cats wore them for a few days and they have raw spots around their necks.  I don't know if it's cheap material or the metal the bell hangs from is rubbing them raw.  The colors are not tight by any means.  Not for sure what is wrong with these collars.  All I know is both my cats were fine before they wore the collars and now they are not.,0
It worked for the first couple of months and then I was dosing every 2 weeks for it to work. I wouldnt recommend it. Its too expensive for it not to work. Ive moved on to another product. Its just not for every cat.,0
My Vet recommended this for my enormously fat cat as we work towards getting him slim. Thankfully Amazon sells it for about $10 less than the Vet's office does. Taking these along with his diet has helped him a lot and he definitely moves much better now than he did before. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who has a cat who may need some help with his joints.,1
This broke and not repairable within a month of very light use,0
"It's just a mat. Does not heat up as claimed. Initially our cat hated the crinkling sound and stayed far away from it. After 4 weeks and much cajoling with her blankie right next to it, she's coming over and sitting on it. Would we buy it again? If it's less than $5, maybe.",0
Well worth my money. I have saved a lot of money grooming my own dog. Perfect set.,1
"This liter box works extremely well.  There is rarely an odor, my cat quickly got use to it.  i didn't realize when I purchased this system how expensive the liter and pads were.  However, the bags of liter lasts for at least a couple of months, although you don't have change it because you scoop out the feces.  The urine goes to the pad below.  I like it, hope you do too.",1
Stopped working after 3 months,0

"I bought this in an attempt to keep my new cat and old cat from fighting with each other...but it did not work.  It made the house smell nice, but the cats still fight right in front of the machine!",0
Not described well. For small pets. Tried to cancel within 2 hours of ordering. They did not honor. Should be a one star rating.,0
makes it easier for my vet not to yell at me for not brushing my cat's teeth,1
There was a hole in the arm of the sweater.  Had to sew it up before it could be worn.  Don't think you should have to mend svomething prior to the first wear.,0
"Inferior durability in plastic, and product was not sealed properly- there were significant gaps between plastic components. The last time I bought a toy like this, it took my parrot several years to dismantle, because it was very durable and high quality. This product she destroyed in under 5 minutes.",0
This is a great house for guinea pigs.  We have 2 and they love it.  Not really big enough for both together but whoever gets in first loves it.,1
Heavy duty.  Easy to wash and dry in the washing machine/dryer. Highly recommend.,1
"I  really like this cat litter. With 5 cats, I use alot of litter. It clumps great. Keeps the odor down. I did mix my last batch with a different litter and because of this, it doesn't clump as tight as it does by itself. I won't be doing that again. I like it comes in 40lbs. I have 2 giant boxes that hold 40lbs each and two normal sized boxes that I split a bag between. I like that I don't have to do a total litter box change often as this litter does a good job keeping the odor down. I have been using this brand for over a year. I will keep buying.",1
"First Impression: This toy seems very sturdy! Plus dad says I make a gsucky faceh noise when Ifm chewing on it (slurp, slurp, slurp). Ifm partial to tennis balls, but this ball is winning right now. Itfs WAY bouncier, and it smells better too. It has all the advantages of the soccer ball, it floats, it bounces, it smells like peppermint, but it seems to be constructed even better! The holes are 1/2 on one end and 3/8 on the other end.

Conclusion: Overall Ifm very pleased with this ball. I donft think Ifll ever be able to destroy it. Itfs super bouncy. It smells great. What more does a giant puppy need? I would definitely recommend this ball!",1
Works well and easy to clean.,1
Did not come with the mat.,0
"I have been using TLF products since the companies inception. Julian Sprung has contributed a lot to the hobby with his articles, books, and innovative products. This product however has missed the mark.

I thought it would be perfect for my standard 2.5g pico reef. The business side of the cleaner has a small round magnet about the size of a watch battery encapsulated in a 1 inch square of soft flexible material. The cleaning surface is the typical velcro-type. The first problem I noticed when using the Nano Mag is that it rotates because both magnets are round. This makes cleaning along the edges and the sandbed troublesome. The other problem is that the soft material of the inner part curls up at the corners, reducing the cleaning surface significantly because only the abrasive surface directly under the dime-sized magnet is scrubbing the glass.

I had high hopes for this product, but was very disappointed with its performance. I am back to my Mag Float mini for now, but am eyeing the Vertex Duplex.",0
Big and green and beautiful really big!! I'm great condition love them,1
"this is great !!! i think the reason people don't like it because for some puppy's it takes longer to see results  & you need to be patince
so just calm down & work as it  is described in the description down here.",1
"This was my 8 month old 13 pound Boston Terrier's favorite bone. However after having it for a week or so the end go so sharp she actually cut the skin on her neck while trying to chew it. She now has an open sore and its in lots of pain and I had to throw this away. I had one of these at my office and my home for her, she really did love them, but they are NOT safe!

Do not leave your dog alone with this product it is not safe.

They are super sharp after use and can hurt your dogs gums and skin! So sharp its cut through my dogs skin! Buyers beware not sure how this was allowed to be sold on Amazon! I also bought one of these at Target I'm going to write them as well!",0
Surprised !!!!! it really works,1
Arrived promptly and dogs love it!,1
Love it !!!!  And so does my puppy !!!!  Just what I needed to protect her from the summer sun.,1
"These pumps are unreliable. Quit working 5 days short of return date required by Amazon. This is the second one of this type which has been unreliable.

"when I received it, it was  lil bit dripping, it's plastic bag was wet. fortunately it had a plastic bag otherwise I've ordered it with an electronic and it could ruin my electronic order !!!!
It smells good and my cat back was a little greasy in some parts that he can't clean by him self, this product could easily clean that greasy parts. I like it.",0
"It's terrible ! UNSAFE FOR YOUR BIRD !!!
and made very cheep!
After 1 week in this new cage my bird died !
My bird stuck in that plastic container, tried to get out and ripped his wing and did so fast ... My heat is broken...
Never ever recommend it !",0
Nylabones are always dependable chews for pups and this was the best price anywhere.  I will order again when needed.,1
I purchased this powder in hopes to discourage my gsd from eating her poop.  It took a few weeks but seems to be effective most of the time.  It may take time to break the habit.,1
Directions not clear. Once set up worked well.,1
"This is listed as a heavy metal crate.  It's not any different than all the other flimsy metal crates that you can buy in the stores.  My 6 month old Doberman puppy has already bent the door inward & ripped a piece off the bottom of the frame.  Whatever happened to the really nice,  well made & AFFORDABLE crates we used to could buy.  I miss the days of the TEScotts  & the Central metal crates.  ",0
I wouldnt know how to review this since I didn't get not only on time but still don't have it. Filter died and I bought this. No return policy. Guess I will need to go and buy one so my fish don't die!,0
No instructions on how to refold. The company YouTube video has cut scenes in the refold part. Bent the spring steel the first attempt. Now can't refold. Only had a day so I can't speak to durability.,0
So weak that it almost doesn't stick together let alone clean the glass. I spent more time fishing around in the tank trying to get it to stick together than anything else.  I normally don't write bad reviews but seriously don't buy this!,0
Didn't work,0
excellent,1
"Yes, came as ordered. Thank you.",1
"The unit is noisy, does not pump 125 gph. unit is poorly designed.  Unit impeller stick and freeze. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!",0
"I have to say, my cat loves these lounges and I've had three of them, but the last one seemed flimsy and didn't fit together correctly, like the others.  And then it collapsed with a week after I purchased it.  So, I bought a different kind of cat lounge similar--that doesn't have parts that have to be put together.  He doesn't like it as much as the Cat Hammock Scratcher, but he didn't get any use out of the last one.  Very sad--the first one lasted nearly a year.  The second one lasted a couple of months, and the last one lasted only a week or so.  And no, my cat hasn't gained weight.",0
Works great with my 70 pound dog and my lawn looks great! Thanks,1
Works well. Larger fish knock it apart sometimes.,1
Perfect! Very happy with the engraving and service.,1
"no, it was advertised for sale with the Petmate Drinkwell system, but it doesn't fit it. It wasn't worth sending it back. Cost $7.00 to send back a $13.00 item. READ ALL THE INFO! I assumed since I searched for the Petmate Drinkwell replacement pump, that is what I would get. Wrong. I'm sure it's a great pump for the right system.",0
My dog liked it but it made her throw up. So I tried giving her less than a quarter of the stick and it still made her throw up.,0
I love this thing so much!! It took me a minute to figure out that if you turn the lid one way it makes a deeper storage compartment and is better for taller dogs so they don't have to bend so much to eat! So smart! I haven't tried putting a water bottle into the section that has the round hole at the top corner (and removing the silver bowl) but it seems like a great idea for a self-filling water bowl. I initially saw this feeder/storage container at a local pet store for $12 more than I bought it here! Great buy!!,1

Discrete and dignified resting place.  Made of quality resin and blends in with decor.  A tasteful final resting place.,1
"I bought one of these at Walmart, and my dogs loved it! So I ordered one more for my pups and two for my sister's dogs. The squeak mechanism from the three pigs that came from amazon were destroyed within two hours of play. The one from Walmart is going strong after a week of constant play.",0
"Way too large and the cat didn't use it. Ended up peeing/pooing all over the house. The one time she did, the rake on the machine didn't clear out all the wastes.",0
Works VERY well!  It says for pets but I was able to get red wine off the carpet!  It's also good for it's purpose...pets!  ,1
WAY TO SMALL,0
"Love it! I'm saving sooooo much money now making my own RODI water for my saltwater aquarium. Perfect for top off's and mixing saltwater. Even though it's only a 3 stage it still knocks my 110ppm well water right down to 0ppm. Wouldn't recommend if you have a large aquarium however, or have a high demand for RODI water, unless you make a ton in advance. Mine produces about 2 gallons an hour or so",1
Natural energy for our puppy. She loves this food!,1
"my dog is half the size and weight it say it would hold and in less than 3 hours my dog ripped it apart from his neck, Very disappointed",0
Lightweight. German Shepard ripped it in less than 1 week.,0
"When we took it out of the bag it smelled so bad - like gasoline.  We tried to air it out, but it didn't improve much.  Ended up throwing it in the garbage.",0
"I purchased two cases of Merricks Wingalings and Smothered Comfort. The label states ""whole thighs"" and ""whole wings"" but that is a lie. Once opened, the cans have one - if you're lucky two pieces. The rest (3/4 of each can) is processed cubes of who knows what my dog refuses to eat. Merricks should either fill the can with what they advertise - ""WHOLE thighs and wings"" - plural - or tell the consumer the truth about what they are selling here.",0
My cat barely touched it and the bird fell off. I tried tying the bird back on securely to fix it but then it was too short for them to really be able to play with it.,0
My mutts all love these salmon treats. Healthy and large pieces.  I'll buy again. They also like the other flavors.,1
"Cozy, but a little long.",1
"I am sure this product works for some cats but not ours. We did not make it past the first stage. She went in it some but then we discovered she was urinating on our bath towels.  You almost have to clean it after each use and I don't have that kind of time. We also sensed our cat was a little stressed and wasn't going when she needed to.  Oh well, we will continue with litter.",0
"The grain of the file is too fine and can't be used as ""an alternative to clipping,"" as some people have said in their reviews. The most it can do without taking a long, long time is soften the edges to make them less sharp. My dog is a little afraid of the clipper and I was hoping to use one of these when I got close to her nerves to avoid accidentally hurting her but it doesn't look like I'll be using it for that much at all.",0
"Great design, love the flexibility and the hip belt - great for running!

The bad - Used it maybe 15 times running with the dog.  Was trail running with my pit puppy (40lbs) and she took off forward after a deer.  The leash shattered where the buckle attaches to the belt - the plastic just completely came apart.  If I didn't have quick reflexes I'd still be chasing her in the woods.

Great product but I'd love to see a metal/upgraded buckle.",0
"had for 2 months, hardly used, won't work",0
Very good,1
"The first flea control threatment that not only works on my cat and lasts well but doesn't make him ill.  To have something that really does the job here in south Texas, where it doesn't freeze often, is saying a lot.  I appreciate that it only makes him sleepy for a day or two not ill.",1
They are great but hard to take off.,1
"The template on the box is useless, not even close to the correct size of the door. Once finally installed after several times remeasuring and recutting and rigging the door works fine. But way more work involved than anticipated. Plus you can see the inside of the door from the back side of the cat door. Would not buy another one",0
"didn't work. I tried the product made by Ceva at my vet's office and it was great . . . this one, however, did nothing.",0
"POOR QUALITY. DO NOT BUY. It was my first time using this product specifically and I immediately noticed how dirty they looked in the box when I received them, but following the directions, I cleaned it off before putting it in the filter. So I had cleaned my fish's tank and not even two hours later, I found him dead in the water. After I flushed my poor fish and emptied the tank, I noticed pieces of the filter floating around inside. My assumption is that he ate the pieces thinking they were food.
My advice: buy your filters at the store and CHECK INSIDE before you purchase them",0
Product arrived quickly and was just as pictured.  Easy to put together and better made han I thought it would be.,1
My dogs love them!!,1
"i was trying this out.  looking for a litter that works for us still.  top marks for clumping.  failing grade for tracking.  we have hardwood floors, and this got everywhere.  when you are bare feet (which i prefer), you can feel the grains.  i feel like because it's so fine, that is why it tracks so easily.  the perfume is very strong....which i suppose is why it controls odours well, by masking them.  will not be buying this again.",0
"Wasn't a good choice for our kitty . . . this collar was deeper from neck to nose than a traditional plastic cone and, although very adjustable in size around the neck, the smaller you adjust it the more rigid it becomes.  Also, the black interior/exterior lining seemed like a real peripheral vision issue (the light color shown in the photo is only the trim.)  Some inflatable ""donut-shaped"" ones can be better as well as less ridged, not-as-deep cones that may be a better choice for cats/shorter muzzle dogs -- always check out case specifics with your vet!  No cone is ""great,"" but we've learned any cone is better received if it's the one used during the pet's first sensory ""adjustment"" hours, i.e., best to already have whatever ""lesser evil"" type of cone to use/try in an emergency supply arsenal so you can start your friend/""kid"" off in the type he/she may have to stay in for the duration.  Either way, changing cone type mid-recovery isn't fun for you or any one of your ""kids.""  Unfortunately we Learned this the hard way, and the plastic cone actual ""won"" this contest.  Don't freak if it takes more than a day for all of you to adjust you will all make it!",0
"I have tried everything, every possible product available out there! I was tired of seeing my cat throwing up two-three times a week.  I tired all treats, as well as petroleum etc. She is not a huge fan of those because treats are soft; however, I play around with it to make her eat it. We are down to throwing up once every three weeks now, big change. As a matter of fact I just incorporated a dry ad wet hairball food to her diet as well.  So far so good and hopefully  it stays that way.  I would strongly recommend it.",1
Good product,1
in sufficient lighting - poor water retention - BEAUTIFUL (hence the 2 stars) just HIGH maintenance. poor filtration too.,0
Not one single light worked on this. Very light weight and cheaply made. Dont waste your money.,0
Locks don't stayed locked.,0
This is the worst quality and durability of any king toy I have had. The fuzz literally comes off in your hands. And my dog took no more than 1 minute to start ripping it apart. It's dangerous how easily this falls apart.,0
What an outstanding color,1
"Great service.  However, my 8 week old Golden Retriever loves the taste.",1
First off the item had no smell to it and seemed weak so I assumed it was a bad batch.  But I contacted the company to see if I could setup an exchange. They got back but insisted I pay shipping back as well. So I would have to pay shipping to me and then back to me over a 12 dollar item. Trust me I'm not scamming even especially on a 12 dollar item. That being said product was weak. Didn't have any fragerence and didn't affect the dog. I will try with another company and product. It's a shame. But hey some companies are only in it for the buck only.,0
just beware of pulling out your cats fur. The cats love this. i loved this ... and couldn't believe how much fur was coming out ... until I realized that I was actually pulling out their fur and not just grabbing the loose hairs. Both my cats have a thin spot on their backs from the first couple days of use. It's so sad ... and they both have very thick healthy coats. They still beg to be brushed with it ... which is why I probably overused it ... but they need a break. I'm going to have to get something gentler to take away the loose fur.  I think the company should warn people about that.,0
"I like this food supplement because she loves the taste and it is easy to administer. This product has lowered her Arabian spookiness but not her alertness or reaction time. I would say it has done a good job so far. She is less spooky and before she jumps at something ""scary"" I can see her assessing the situation and listening to the softness of my voice and calming a bit. She listens and hesitates before she gets all worked up. That is what I wanted. I didn't want a drugged up effect, just a chance for her to think before reacting. I will definitely keep feeding her Smart Calm.",1
A must have for dog owners who trim their dogs' nails. Especially those that are black!,1
Did not work at all for our older cats,0
"Doesn't seem to have any effect on my 60 pound dog. I've tried giving him extra but no dice. I've never had any luck with any of these types of calming pet products, though.",0
"I  have six Bichons and half of them seem to get loose stools or diarrhea w/ mucous every time I include this in their food.  Funny thing is, I had given  them the Grizzy Polluck in the past, and it didn't do this to them.  I have stopped and started with it, so I am reasonably sure this may be the culprit to their GI issues.  I love salmon for me and my family.  But every stinking time I use the prescribed amount, or even less, 3 out of 6 of them get the runs--even to the point of rectal blasting/shower.  It's quite the mess, and these guys are usually pretty great w/ taking their business outside.  I want to like it, but I can't.  I may try the polluck again, or I will just supplement every couple of days with tiny amounts of finely ground sardines.",0
It works but not unless the dog is directly in front of it. It could receive better.  I have a neighbor who's dog barks constantly. Mine doesn't unless some stranger approaches. I don't regret the purchase but wish it was better quality. Thanks.,1
"-That's the name of my dog, Luna. It's cool that it glows in the dark, chewable and no damage done.",1

"Bought this under tank heat pad for my hermit crab terrarium.  Only one inch of sand on the bottom the tank (directions was for 1.5"" max) and this pad was unable to heat the tank up even one degree.  My crabs are cold and lethargic.  Was a total waste of money.",0
Absolutely love my new grooming table - no more sitting in the floor to groom.,1
"This product is easy to use, keeps the aquarium water clear, and is quiet. No need to prime the pump. The service from the vendor was excellent, and the cost of shipping more than fair. I could not have bought these filters at our local PetSmart or other stores for anywhere near this price. Plus, they stock only packs of three. I am well satisfied with this purchase.",1
I have recently purchased a puppy and was in need of something for my dog when I'm gone at work.  Great quality that doesn't tear like the cheaper ones do.  Also the bullseye is great for teaching her to go in the middle!  I would recommend these pads to everyone! What a lifesaver!,1

"Kongs are the only toy I've found that hold up to my heavy chewers.  I have a shepherd mix and a hound dog -- between them, they have vanquished many toys supposedly made for heavy chewers.

I put their kibble in the Kong and seal it with peanut butter, and that's their breakfast when I leave for work.  This is the only toy I'll leave them with when I'm not around to supervise.",1
"Did not stay on at all, and dog still got to her stitches",0
Works great for my Sphynx cat,1
Very convenient for travel. I have a little doxy and she likes to be outside people watching.,1
"I liked the price, the quality was questionable. First bulb lasted two months, second bulb lasted maybe a week. Was excited for the deal, but it wasn't worth it at all. Now my lizard is without a light until I get to the pet store for a quality bulb.",0
I love it!!! It is very portable and durable! I am very pleased,1
"i used this product it seems to work pretty good i have seen no fleas since i have put it on my dog.
doesnt smell too bad. and my dog doesnt mind wearing it.",1
"I thought this brush would work well on my border collie's rough coat. I had hoped to use it as a daily quick brush to keep her full coat looking good, but it can't seem to fight its way through. It's okay after she's blown her coat. I'm not sure if the problem is the pin brush or the memory gel grip, which makes it surprisingly hard to feel what I'm doing. For what it's worth, the cats prefer their smaller brush with metal pins.",1
It's good fish food.,1
love the service and the dogs can't wait for their toothbrushes.,1
"Oh HELL NO.  I paid over $30 for 2 of these?  NOT what I thought I had purchased, considering the 12 packs are @$5 at Wal-Mart & Target.  Right product, wrong price.",0
"I purchased 2 of these collars. The literature says the package includes a long lasting battery. Either the battery is dead, or the collars just don't work. I need some bark inhibitor collars for the dogs, but these just don't live up to any of the advertisement.",0
My dog doesn't like it and refuses to eat it (I have to wrap it  up in cheese in order for him to eat it) also I've never noticed any calming affects once he takes it.,0
"love oit, my dog smells great",1
"On NO planet would this little azz bed be considered an x-large. Unfortunately, when I opened it, I set it in the floor and my dog came and sat on the top (because there is NO way she is getting in this bed.  This Xlarge might work for a chihuahua, but definitely not an actual XL..my other little dog doesn't even fit and he's a frenchie!",0
"These seem really cheap for the price I paid. They never felt like they were tightening to the collar. Ultimately they were too short for our dog, which was my fault in ordering. We did not use them. Money wasted on what seemed like it would be great for our pet.",0
AMAZING value!,1
"Had the smaller Flexi leash when we got our puppy. It worked well for about a month then she managed to chew the leash enough for it to brake. I purchased this in hopes of a stronger less brakable cord but was very dissapointed. Had this one for less than 2 days before the cord broke. She hadnt chewed it at all, it rubbed the side of our shed when she ran around the corner and then broke. The action on it is very smooth and I like the ease of the lock and release so thats the only reason it gets 2 stars.",0
"I bought this harness for my border collie/lab mix and I've had it for less than a year. It was fine in the beginning but then I started to notice scratches around his legs/chest area. Now, their are welts and no matter how much I adjust the sizing, it just won't seem to get better. Also, my dog pulls a lot and this helps a bit but definitely isn't the best product for that.",0
This little thing vibrates like mad.  I had to really pad it so I couldn't hear it in the next room.  Hope my little Gypsy likes it though.,0
"When I bought this, it said THREE refills.  Now, it just says refills (plural) BUT you get ONE at $35!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!  I will by the 6 pack at 1/3 the cost of this SINGLE refill!!",0
My cat loves all three dinners. He prefers the textures much more than pate.,1
Arrived quickly.  My dogs love them!,1
needs a carry  handle,1
"I own two of these products (one for each cat) and they both work great. Setup is pretty simple and once you set the times the only thing you have to worry about is filling the trays. Prior to this purchase our cats would constantly wake us up in the middle of the night or early morning to feed them. This led to us either getting up and reinforcing the behavior or tolerating an hours worth of scratching and meowing. Since we purchased this product they get fed at 2am and again at 6am and the cats haven't bothered us since.

We use this with both wet food and dry food and the insert is easy to remove to fill and easy to clean with a bit of soap and water. The cats now associate the sounds of the motor turning with food and go running when they hear it. I also find that this product is not loud enough to disturb us or wake us in the middle of the night.

No problems with the cats opening it themselves or turning the mechanism to get at food early.",1
"I normally love Pet Naturals of Vermont's products. However, the DMG bone-shaped chews for dogs is not one of them. First, the chews are teeny tiny. So if you have a big dog you are out of luck. My Doxie is 15 pounds and they were too small for him. Second, the are very moist - too moist. Third, the amount is not enough, doesn't last very long. All in all, not one of this company's better products. I was very disappointed.",0
"I am searching for something besides Frontline to use on my smaller cat. This has been the best I have found. Sadly, it hasn't continued to work for the entire month. It starts to fail for fleas at about 3 weeks. Other brands have lasted only a couple of weeks and do not work at all on worms, ear mites, or flea allergy problems (which this product has eliminated). I would recommend that you try it.",1
"These do not fade, warp or weaken after extended wear.",1
"My poor Great Dane was allergic to this. He scratched and chewed out bald spots all over his body. I tried to wash it out after a few days when I realized and it won't come all the way out.  I also bought the smaller dog dosage. The foster dog that I put it on still got fleas. I washed her with Dawn dishsoap first to kill all the fleas then I put this on her. Nope, after 5 days she had fleas again. The price for this stuff is nice, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.",0
Bought this thinking it would keep my cats happy but found that they were not interested mainly because the lights flashing very rarely happened even when they laid on the mat.  Was disappointed and would not recommend,0
I ordered the  super worms  I was supposed to get them in two days  which was a Monday and I didn't get them until Friday .  The worms where a nice size and healthy looking but there was no food in with the worms  so the worms  went all them days without food,0
"Garlic is toxic to dogs, especially over extended periods of time.... I would reconsider buying these.",0
"The Kitty Tube is great!  I bought this for a stray cat that hangs around close to my patio.  It took him a while to get into it.  At first he was suspicious,but by later that night he was resting comfortably in his new digs.  Since I have got it, he has barely left the patio.  It has been unusually warm, so when it is warm he camps on top of it.  It is great.  I am glad I got the Kitty Tube!",1
nice chew toy that puppy cant destroy,1
"Great product, but not happy with the service! The product information didn't say wether it was clip or slip on. I wanted the clip so when I returned the product they didn't provide a return label so basically i paid for the collar 2x. Shipping cost as much as the collar. Not happy",0
"Bought this product 4 months ago for my 60 lb husky and the leash broke. The ribbon material ripped clean through, leaving the clip still on my dogs collar, and the remainder of the leash retracted into the holder. As a manufacturer of pet leashes, I believe it is very important to make a quality product because I am choosing to trust the safety of my dog as well as other people that pass by in your product. To have a leash that just ""breaks"" is very disappointing. Thankfully, he was not near any busy streets or any children.

Sincerely,
A Disappointed Customer",0
Great product!  Works well on my dog!!!  Would buy from them again and it arrived in great condition to. Thanks,1
Smells good but keeps opening up have to keep sliding it closed,0
I changed my rating within a few months from 5 to 1...the motor started to stop randomly and heat up... sometimes even when I was gone or at night. Very dangerous. I finally gave up and bought a different one.,0
"I was anticipating this product because of the good reviews of the brand and not to mention it's adorable! Anyway, got this Medium a few days ago for my 9lb mini dachshund. Strapped him in only to find out that while his chest measures within the guidelines for the medium, it was very snug around the breast and the velcro could only go halfway so the velcro was showing.

Other than this, I am very impressed with the quality of how this product was made. I ended up returning this and ordering the large (I can't believe I have to buy a large for my mini dachshund!)

If you're planning to buy this, do think about measuring the breast girth because it's most important and if your dog falls between the suggested size, ORDER ONE SIZE UP.",1
"Item description states you will get a 6""-8"" piece of driftwood. As you can see the piece I got was at the very maximum 5.5"". I am highly disappointed as the piece I got looked nothing like other pictures and I didn't even get the size I was promised when I placed my order. Item description is not accurate.",0
The quantity for the price is great! I started purchasing the small 4oz can at the pet store and it ran me about $4.00 I have filled up that small can at least 5 times and still have some left.  Great value and my turtle loves it.,1
"I honestly never take the time to write a review unless I'm either really satisfied with the product, or I'm terribly disappointed with the product. In this case, I am so very disappointed in this product, save your money!!

The amount of litter this pan waste because of its poor design, is unacceptable! I would definitely purchase the Omega Paw and roll.",0
Tangled easily. Not appropriate for use with animals that are not dogs.,0
Good dog food,1
"The picture shows decent-looking clips, but in reality the clips are cheap and difficult to open.  I don't recommend this product.  I returned it and purchased a slightly more expensive tie out made by a different manufacturer that explicitly calls out bronze clips.  Looking closely at the picture you can tell that these are not standard clips but rather a cheap kind of clip that has a compression connection to the cable.  In the future I will know to look for this kind of clip and avoid it.",0
My cat loves it! She was using a bowl that was flat on the floor which was causing her to throw up. The raised bowl has helped and she hasn't thrown up at all. It's also super cute.,1
The flimsy plastic pieces that cover the interior of the door have to be cut and then taped into place.  The bolts have to be cut with a hacksaw to to fit correctly.  The cut out measurements in the instructions are not the right dimensions.  Piece of crap.  Poorly designed.,0
"Well it was beautiful and functional and ""well-made"" until I washed it...twice. And now it's a shredded mess of fabric. WTH.
  Sincerely, Duped in AK",0
These are my dogs favorite and special treats.  We give them to our dogs at night time and our one dog Holly literally goes running into her crate to get her treat.  No issues at all.,1
I ordered this and got 2 clips with suction cups not even with a defective magnetic,0
Not a rigid bouncy framed ball but instead folds in on itself when kicked and doesn't go as far.  Dog likes it ok but not what I was looking for.,0
"Our dogs loved these, until it almost killed them.  Ill never buy dog food or treats from China again.  I heard that Nestle is releasing them again.",0
This is the most favorite thing after eating that my dog loves.  This brush is durable and the pets love it too.  Great price and fast delivery too.,1
Good but hard to put on,1
Didn't fit our 11 lb Shih Tzu/Poodle mix.  She was still able to reach beyond the cone to her feet/hot spots.,0
It is as advertised.  I ordered a medium which is 14 to 18 inches in circumference.  Just right for my 65 pound dog.  I should have read the description more carefully and payed less attention to the picture.  The width is only  inches.  Just think how narrow that is on a 65 pound dog.  It is useless.  Be sure to read the descriptions carefully.  I learned my lesson for $15.50,0
"I did a lot of shopping around, trying to find the best food for my new puppy. The first half of this food's ingredient list reads like stuff I would eat (the rest is vitamin and mineral fortification), and so excited that it's all organic.
I was happy to find as I poured it the first time, that it has real, visable chunks of fruits and veggies. Wow! Real food you can actually see!
Alas, even though my puppy loves this food (and my sneaky senior dog too), my puppy has had horrible liquid diarrhea ever since we had him really. He's been tested for parvo, parasites, given antibiotics, etc. The only thing that helped was the digestive health food the vet sent him home with. Corn, corn, and corn is in the top 5 ingredients of that stuff. So although I would love to give him healthy, organic food with no GMO corn and whatnot, he has a sensitive belly and cannot eat this.",1
excellent,1
It said large on the web site and yet it wouldn't even fit over my 10 week old puppy's head.  misleading information.,0
"My Corgi, who gets tired of his toys quickly, loves this toy and chews on it every day.  I've purchased all sorts of chew toys for him in the past and this one seems to be his favorite.",1
The fabric ripped after my cat used it for a week. I'm very disappointed in this product.,0
"This is hands down the best litter box I've ever owned and that's saying a lot since I've had cats for every 42 years of my life.  Large enough for my pudge-ball fur-baby to turn around in and the clumping litter doesn't stick to it so it's very easy to scoop.  The retractable lid makes it super easy to see when you need to scoop, then put it back in place for the filter to do it's job.",1
"This harness has a great design that prevents wiggling free, but material needs to be more sturdy. Chest ripped at the neckline after 5 wears.  Im sad because I thought this was the answer to my prayers. ",0
Dog backed out of harness and ran into oncoming traffic and hit a car.  Luckily only ended up with cuts and scrapes and a $250 vet bill.,0
Comes unscrewed very easy.,0
The bed is very statically charged and is already sagging less than a month later! I would not purchase again nor recommend.,0
works well,1
"Lasted all of one week before the light stopped working. Kept using it as a collar till yesterday when the clasp broke. Lasted all of a month, total junk.",0
"I have used both avantix and advantage. I can not understand the rationale to make this products extremely expensive, 4 applications for over $35 dls?. Do they make generic brands? I'd like to know.",0
"My dog used to have a nozzle that fit on the end of the faucet outside.  He had to lick it to get the water to come out.  This is so much better!  The other only gave out a small stream and he had to lick at it for several minutes swallowing air with the water.

Pros-This product supplies endless fresh water.  It is easy for the dog to drink out of.  It decreased the air my dog swallowed over other automatic waterers that hook up to the faucet.  My dog gets to drink as much as he wants.

Cons-green algae grows in the bottom.  We just dump it periodically and wipe it out.

Summary-we will definitely be buying more of these as the need arises.",1
"I am a licensed veterinarian for 39 years and I would not recommend this product if your dog has kidney disease, liver disease or certain types of urinary calculi (stones).  The active ingredient in it appears to be DL-methionine, which is an urinary acidifier, and is contraindicated with the above types of medical conditions. Yellow grass is better than a sick dog.",0
My pooch really enjoys this I think it's her favorite treat.,1
"This product was described as great for small and large dogs alike. I tried it on both my dog's one small and one large, and it did not work on either one. It wasn't quiet either. I think the file itself is just too soft. I find the Dremel tool works much better. I returned this product. Maybe it might work great for cats but not dogs.",0
"My cat just loves this!  I have left it out since I got it and she has not lost interest.  She would have me play with her for hours if I would do it!  She loves to hide in the tunnels and jump out after fishing pole toys!  Has lost interest in playing on the rug  by herself but that is okay.  Wish the top rug was just a bit stiffer!

Edit:  11-12-16 I just lowered my review from 5 to 3!  The problem is that I have only had my rugs for a few months and all the stiffness has gone out of the top rug.  I can't get the top rug  to even create a small tunnel for her to hide in.  If anyone know of a way to re-new this feature I would love to know.

edit:  4-9-2017  Washed it in the bathtub and then found out that the newer ones can be put in the machine.  Although all the stiffness did not return this is still her favorite toy.  When I removed it to the bathroom she followed & started to cry!  How funny is this?  If I try to play in other areas of the house she goes and sits by the rug.",1
Fitmet  was small,0
"If I could give no stars, I would. I read all of the glowing reviews and thought I finally found an all natural wipe for my dogs, but my search will continue because these wipes are anything but natural. I'm absolutely disgusted with the false advertisements listed for this product. It says ""All Natural Ingredients - Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, and Hawaiian Awapuhi"", which makes you think they are the only ingredients in these wipes. Wrong! These wipes also contain polysorbate 20 and benzoic acid. A Google search of polysorbate 20 shows that it can be contaminated with carcinogenic 1,4-Dioxane, which is linked to skin irritations, skin allergies, cancer, etc. As for benzoic acid, it is typically made in a lab from other chemicals and can cause allergy like symptoms, etc. This product is also made in China, which is not made clear.",0
Just the right amount of looks and weight. My ginger kitty looks bada$$.  It is also useful as a protective element when he plays with my boyfriend's husky.  She's two and likes to grab him by the scruff of the neck.  This little spike collar I'm hoping will discourage some of the rough housing.  Well made item.,1
Great toy! If used with kittens whom are smaller or younger. My 5 and 7 month old kittens knock this over constantly and I need to tip it back up so it continues to work properly. Would love to see this made in a larger version for bigger cats. Or a bigger better base. Other than that it's a big hit!,1
Very well made,1
"My American Bulldog and my Collie like to play hard in the yard, and the old Petsafe collars broke on both dogs.  The Petsafe collar has a light duty latch that pops loose easily and eventually broke on both dogs.  This heavy duty strap is noticeably better when you first pick it up.  The latch is larger and has smoother edges so it doesn't get caught and pop loose, and the strap material is a much softer and flexible material than the original as well as being a bit wider - it is a much higher quality strap with pre-cut holes fort the receiver - works great!",1
"I purchased this product after my doctor recommended compression socks to help alleviate the swelling I have in my legs due to an accident I was involved in.  After having worn the socks for a couple of days, I have already noticed how much better my legs look and how the swelling has gone down significantly. In addition, they are extremely comfortable.  I highly recommending purchasing these socks.",1
"These are fantastic!  I received 3 large, thick, whole antlers that were trimmed with rough edges smoothed out.  When they arrived, my dog must have smelled the antlers and found where I had put the package while they were still wrapped in plastic in the unopened envelope- that's how you know they're good!  These are MUCH better than the weird, small, gray/white antlers they sell at pet stores for $12 each, or $9 if found at Marshall's or Home Goods. These are very much worth the price for what you get. I have a 60 lb mutt that loves to chew and he is set for the rest of the year as far as antlers go with this 1 purchase. Highly recommended!",1
"Good filter, does what it's supposed to do",1
Good work.,1
Stop working after 4 weeks.,0
PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS! This is absolutly terrible. The smell is horrific and caused me to be sick to my stomach. I became nasuas after spreading across 3 - 3x3 squares in a small room. It did not do anything but cover the odor. Save your money and a headache. I considered having my carpets replaced due to the smell. It also ruined my vacuum which is a dyson vacuum. It caused it to smell as well. DO NOT BUY IT!,0
This toy lasted less than 30 minutes before my Husky started removing large chunks.  Attached is my Kong graveyard.,0
"I was a bit skeptical at first, because I thought it was automatic and I haven't heard great things about those. Then when I got it, I was even more skeptical. But the first time I used it I fell in love. The whole process takes two minutes tops, and no scooping needs to be done. I have three (very dirty) cats and one large box is perfect for them all.",1
The best invention for the tank filter. To clean the hoses is great and saves money on replacements,1
Very very tiny. Not at all what i was looking for. Not very versatile,0
This was supposed to be the same as Apoquel.  It was not.  It did not help the itching problem at all.  Now I have 5 bottles that I can't use.  I do not recommend this product as a substitute for Apoquel.,0
Destroyed in under one minute,0
"This is quite useless as a pet correction gadget. Dogs will ignore the voice coming from the collar after a while, as you are not standing there for the dog to associate the voice with someone.

I bought this at a dollar store for two bucks. As I expected, the battery in the collar unit was nearly dead, it only functions best when plugged in or its internal PL503040 3.7v polymmer battery replaced. So if your dog gets lost, the thing is quite useless, unless you keep it turned off. Still good for short term FRS communications.

However, the other half of this novelty is that it seems to be using GMRS / FRS network. It picked up a couple of chatters while I tried it in the Long Beach Marina area. Both transmitters were too weak to make any understandable response back to them - one guy told me to throw the piece of rubbish away and get a REAL GMRS radio from a pawn shop!

It's still useful for short-distance communications around the house like adjusting the antenna, or checking the fuse box. There are other GMRS gadget pairs that are cheaper.

It was a good patent idea on paper, however, it was poorly executed. If it was properly executed with durable/replaceable collar batteries, it would have been too expensive or too bulky for the dog.",0
So soft! My puppy loves it!!!,1
"Great!
Took 5 minutes and saved me 20 $. Good alternative to changing your pump... made me save 20 $",1
Recently adopted a new puppy as a playmate for our current little guy but she had been having a lot of problems going to the bathroom from the first week. When she started getting nauseous I was planning on switching foods yet again until I found this product locally and decided to give it a try. It seemed like the right choice given her symptoms and I was not disappointed. Her stool is much healthier after only a week or so and there is no nausea to speak of. I think what was most surprising to me was the unexpected benefit of her becoming calmer as a result. Understandable if she was as upset as she was. We all love this product!,1
"Little stick-on piece with the ""Weaver"" logo is held on by weak glue, it fell off after roughly 3 weeks and slightly curious doggo scooped it up and started choking on it.  Should come with a warning that the small piece can come off and cause a choking hazard.",0
good,1
I was excited when I received this product because the scent was appealing and it worked well. Unfortunately the effects only lasted for one day and I had to replace and fill the glass in which I used the product every day. For me it was not worth the money.,0
I end up returning this product because the item description was not clear.  The item did not fit my dog.,0
"I used this ear solution as it states on the bottle for a mild/moderate yeast infection in my dogs left ear. It didn't work, brought dog to vets.",0
Very nice dog is a raiders fan...... Barking and fighting leashes fit character. Fast shipping good product sturdy accurate description,1
"These pellets are great.  My red eye tetra love them.  They are a nice small size and either float nicely on the top of the water, or slowly sink down, which my fish love.  I have used these for a long time and it is a food I use consistently for my fish.",1
"It gets 5 stars for the cute pattern, but it was way too bulky for a medium dog collar. The clasp was also really big. Lastly, I couldn't make it tighter because the sewn on logo was in the way and prevented me from being able to tighten it. Too bad.",0
"Highly recommend! the handle size is perfect for my hand and the leash works well for my Chihuahua Yorkie.  I like that the leash doesn't click as it goes in and out, very quiet.  Would buy again.",1

"Bought on accident.  Very cute,  wrong size.  Received a medium  should've been an x small for my four and half pound toy fox terrier",0
"I had one of the original LitterMaid Megas for 7 years before the cable broke (got snagged in the rake).  I purchased a replacement (an upgraded version of the original model) that lasted almost a year before it burned out.  I called the company since it was still within the warranty period, and I was sent this P.O.J. model.  I tried to get them to send one of the older models, based on the reviews I saw of the newer one, but they didn't carry them in the Mega version.  The new one didn't even last 3 weeks.  For those who this product actually worked longer than 1 month for, consider yourselves lucky.  So much for a ""better, new improved product"".  That was the first and only newer LitterMaid product I will ever purchase or use ever again.

I've been a mechanic, I've worked on computers, and I've worked in construction.  I know sometimes new stuff breaks.  It happens.  Every now and then you get a lemon, but a lot of people got lemons in this product, and that's a bad trend.  Whatever design flaws this thing has really needs to be addressed.  Some of the improvements they made were great (like the rake movement and how it pushes the litter into the receptacle instead of shoveling it), but all the functional and aesthetic improvements aren't worth a flip if the machine itself can't stay working for longer than its warranty period.

Until the durability issues are addressed, I will keep away from ever purchasing a LitterMaid product.  In fact, because of the durability issues, I ordered 2 SmartScoop automatic litterboxes just yesterday.  They're a little more expensive, but the reviews are nothing but fantastic.  I will write a review of mine when I have had adequate time to evaluate them.",0
I loved this product when I bought it. It worked great for almost a year. My cats drank more water from it and it also fascinated them. Then one day it stopped dispensing water. The motor stopped working. The only thing to do was to get rid of it. I would not buy another one.,0
"This is a nice looking, durable bag. Unfortunately it is impossible to fit a bale of hay in it. I have never seen a bale of hay small enough that it could fit inside of this bag.",0

"Returned it - thin, flimsy plastic I know won't hol up to my dog...best for small dogs.",0
These caps work but they feel pretty cheap and the plastic is so thin that they are very rigid.  We also ordered one that was a bit more expensive but it has a softer rubbery feel to it and it's obvious that you get what you pay for.,0
Incredible price on these products and excellent quality.,1
Great basket that allows egg collector to wash eggs with ease.,1
I love being able to offer my girls different beds around the house and even in my car and at camp. With these quality covers it's affordable to do so. My hubby always has foam laying around so I can whip up a bed any time I need to.,1
good service and product,1
The bags are great and they aren't too thin. This pack has lasted for what feels like forever.,1

"Before using this product I used other omega products, but by far this is the best. It has made my pets coat very soft and shiny. You will not see a difference after you first day, but give it a couple weeks and you'll see a difference (I did). In additiOn, they haven't been scratching as much.",1
This crate did not stand up to my German Shepherd for even one day!! Total waste of money for me.,0

Flap was not dark as seen in the picture. And the cat door was too thin to fit in my interior door. We used the template to cut out a hole but the two parts were too far apart to connect through my door.,0
It is a toy that broke the 3d time I used it.. Wished I hadn't wasted my time or my money.,0
this did not work either for my dogs would also like to return this,0
This Litterbox cover is smaller than they advertise. There is no way that a large size litter box can fit this thing. Only some medium size litter boxes fit but they are too small for my cat.,0
My parakeets love this.  They like the mirror and the dial that they love turning.,1
We took her to vet. a poor lady who had once been bit by gs was in waiting room . Bella would not have hurt her but she did not know this. As I got a better grip on leash the coller sliped easy off her head. Larer we tightend it with same results. The chain lets it slip off easy. If you can solve that problem it would be a nice pretty and safe coller,0

"We've been feeding Zupreem pellets to our African grey for over 20 years. She loves this food and has thrived on it. We were feeding her the fruit flavor Zupreem, but she would only eat certain colors. For example, blue pellets would end up on the cage floor. She much prefers the natural flavor. She is a fan. Our bird's health is excellent. This is a much safer food than nuts and seeds which can contain toxins from mold. We lost a sun conure from these toxins.",1

"Arrived quickly and well packaged.  Little Emma LOVES them!  In fact, she;s chewing on one now.  It keeps her busy and, more importantly, keeps her teeth busy LOL!",1
"Corgis are a strange fit. This didn't work out for me. It fit around the waist, but not around the neck. Make sure you measure the wasit and neck. I wish it worked out, but it didn't fit my corgi too well.",0
Received it earlier than arrival date. Very easy to use and works great.,1
My dog loves these! Good quality.,1
Well made and did the job.,1
I was going to return these as initially my dog turned up his Italian Greyhound nose. But hour later he jumped up on the couch next to me with one of these tracheas in his mouth.  He loves them and is not intimidated by their size.,1
Beyond excellent.  Have been feeding our kitty these treats for several years.  Am no longer able to find these in local stores and am beyond pleased with being able to acquire them via Amazon.  And the price is very good.  These soft treats are excellent for cats who are growing older.  All cats love them!,1
"Ordered an xlarge. recieved a large. it may fit a large ""small breed"" but thats about it",0
When I took my dog to the vet he gave her these vitamins  so l been buying them  for a while now,1
"We had to adjusted it to make it fit and he immediately took it off, evey time we put it on he took it off, now we can not send it back so we lost over $70 that is a very bad product and return system, I am very upset.",0
"We certainly appreciate the quiet, but the toy is not durable at all. We have a 33 pound mix who chewed one of the ears off within a couple minutes of receiving it. It has been gradually getting more and more shredded, and it is about time to throw it away. If the company made these more robust, they would have a killer product.",0
Tore quickly...,0
I purchased three as Christmas presents for my grand doggies.....they loved them!,1
I used it exactly as in the photos & videos on both my dogs (one has long fur & one has short fur) & it removes LESS fur than the Furminator.,0
"It did not work and it had no instructions with it. I complained and Amazon told me to look it up on the internet. Not right. It is true ""you get what you pay for""",0
Both my mini aussies love this.  All I have to do is pick up the bag and they are right in front of me waiting.  Greenies don't have a chance.,1
VERY USEFUL AND GOOD PRICE,1
"Bought this toy and another kong Squirrel dog toy for my 2 Labs. with in 20 mins of giving them to the dogs, they had it tore open and the squeeker out.. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!",0
"Poorest quality bison bones I've seen! One was broken when I opened the box, splintered with sharp edges!",0
I have a 2 pound maltichon puppy who gets very cold on walks.  Comes to a stand still and it is great to have the bag to carry her in.  I throw a blanket in there and am her personal chauffeur.  Very easy to use and love the clip the hook her harness on so she doesn't jump out.  I would recommend this carrier.,1
"I have bought two of these in the last month. Neither of the ""static"" options work on either. I have tested both on myself. And one of the remotes has a glitch in the screen and it's hard to read. I am working with the retailer on returning both. So far they have been quick to respond.",0
The metal comb came bent and is very harsh on my little dogs skin. The rake comb is spaced so far apart it doesn't do anything for my dog's coat.,0
"I love this cat tree, it is very cute, sturdy and easy to assemble (same as any Ikea furniture) but it is small. I have an 8lbs cat and it is slightly too small for him.",1
"I am very disappointed in this bed - especially since I have it in a smaller version and have loved that one.  My puppy grew out of his small Fido bed, but because he loved it and it washed so well, I went out of my way to get what I thought would be the same bed in a larger size.  All the stuffing in the cushion shifted to one spot when it was washed.  Also, the cushion is smaller that the bed and leaves a gap between cushion and sides of bed.  That didn't happen in the smaller version.  I'm just disappointed.",0
Perfect for our dogs! I love it. The quality is nice. It's thick and the handles aren't weak.,1
We bought it for our new puppy. Fits perfect and works excellent.,1
"We had a lightening strike this summer. This unit saved the fence controller, but the surge protector went into a resonance mode which activated the shock mechanism in the dogs' collars. They freaked out. Panamax replaced the unit but I'm not going to use it, since I'd rather replace the controller from time to time than risk having my dogs shocked.",0
"These pumps are not durable, and they are not powerful enough to generate a steady flow of water for the Drinkwell Pet Fountain.  The original pump that came with the fountain barely generated a trickle of water, then died after only 3 months.  The replacement that I ordered is even less effective than the original.  An imperceptible amount of water comes out the fountain.  Huge disappointment!",0
Love the product.  It's only vice is that it only operates on batteries and does not have the ability to plug in for non-battery operation.  It would be fantastic if it did both. Amazing training product!  I use it in our office with our dog so he does not mug guests as they come in.,1
"I am feeding 4 baby racoons,  I have not seen their mother, but they are hungry and seem to be on their own.  Thank God for Amazon and their reasonable price for this cat food..  They come every evening around 6 pm and eat a large bowl of this ( every little morsel is cleaned up) with another very large bowl of fresh water which they all drink out of and then wash their hands and feet in it.
THANK-YOU AMAZON!",1
"My dog hated this bed. She tore it up in 3 days. I believe it was the smell and texture of the bed. The inside is like a carton shaped foam. The outside material is silky.
I was not a fan either. You get what you pay for.",0
"My dog really enjoys these. The source I used to buy this particular treat from quit selling the product.
So I was glad to find another. They make a special, healthy treat for a job well done.",1
This didn't fit my German Shepherd even though the packaging specifically said it would.,0
My dog thought the bed was a toy and shredded the bed before I had a chance to fold up the box the bed came in and put it in recycling A bid waste of money,0
Very soft breathable material,1
"BIG rope and my dog loves it! Because of its sturdiness and size, I can play tug of war with her and it doesn't hurt my wrists.",1
Cute bed. Puppy loves it. Fits pretty good in crate. A small space around the edge but nothing major.,1
the product is exactli what I need for my big dogs. it work all year. will be more shopping next year,1
dog was able to chew through the handle,0
"My second dog, Mila has a pretty skinny neck and a thin head- she can slide out of a lot of collars with very little effort. She's still growing (9 months old right now), and when we first got this we had to make it as small as possible, but it worked due to how the Martingales function. We've since let it out 2 inches, and it still works great and other than getting a little dirty, shows no signs of wear.

Our other dog has a matchign collar one size larger, and her's is still in great shape as well!!",1
"We have a Hartz finishing brush, with small plastic globules on each bristle. They love that, and it works to a degree. We also have a longer-tined metal brush with rounded ends that goes deeper. They /hate/ that, they run at the sight of it. So I was concerned about this product, till a friend insisted I try one, and he brought it over. SOLD! They love it, and it takes a ton of undercoat out, with gentle strokes. This product is not cheap, but it works, and they love it. I'll continue to use the Hartz brush once or twice/wk to slick their coats, I believe it's called a ""finishing brush"" anyway. But once a week they'll get the furminator.

DISCLAIMER: Another friend has one and his cat will tolerate it for a few strokes and that's it. I can only speak for my own situation. The friend who brought it over initially, his cat is closer to mine, but even he was surprised how much my cats loved it. Your mileage may vary, but I'm a happy camper!",1
"Too many hard large pieces (feet, hooves) that my dogs didn't care for.",0
By far the best dog seat cover I have ever purchased. Solid and sturdy material. The cover actually stays over the seats instead of moving all over the place when the dogs jump in. Great investment to protect your car.,1
No match for our strong chewer!,0
Very good product. I finally can brush my kitten teeth without their resistance. The brush is soft and easy to use. Perfect size for kitten.,1
"It failed in first two weeks of usage. I thought at first the battery just drained that fast, but with a fresh battery installed I used the tester that comes with the collar and the indicator light never came on. Really disapointed with this product as other reveiws had glowing satisfaction reports. I threw it away and will find another elswhere.",0
"It didn't come with directions, so this will be interesting. Also all the bolts were scattered all iver the box.",0
These things suck! They fall apart and I had to superglue mine together.would not recommend them. Very cheaply made!,0
"When it works, it works great.  But unfortunately, it has to fit so perfectly on my dog's neck to work that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  This results in my dog taking the chance and barking anyway.  In order for it to work it has to be so tight on her throat that the prongs are jabbed into her neck, so I would NEVER recommend leaving your dog unsupervised with it on!  It also must be exactly in the right spot on her throat - which I have yet to figure out where the magic spot is. I would not buy this collar again - way too unreliable!",0
Easy to use.  We like the tie handles.  Will order again.,1
They are just right.,1
"This is the cutest collar Ive ever seen, but its absolutely the worst quality. We had it on my very lazy French bulldog and within a few days, the glitter paper had started to come off on the side, we lost several of the rhinestones and every sizing hole (she only used one of them) had lost the pink color around it. My dog is lazy- she is not hard on collars, but this thing was complete junk. Only get this if you want to put it on for some kind of special occasion. Im very sad we had to return this, it really was adorable.",0
it came broken,0
Great little brush for kitchen counter sweeping. Cleaning crumbs and dusting is very easy with this brush. I really like it.,1
"I have two cats that love this, and they both get on together.  I should have purchased a larger size.",1
This harness seems to be rather fragile since the metal connector arrived broken.,0
This spray smells so strong and awful.  And it'll stay strong smelling for a week.  I think it may have worked but I will never use again.  Gave me a headache.  I never even opened the wipes that I also purchased.,0
"I didn't realize these balls were made in China, until I received the package which stated: ""designed in USA, made in China"".  I've read too many accounts of toxins and death coming from pet supplies made there and I will be returning these items immediately.  These balls may be perfectly safe, but I will not use my dogs as test subjects.  Very disappointed, Kong; and very disappointed, Amazon.",0
I laughed out when I open the package - it's so huge and so heavy! Can well practice lifting when I walk my dog. But quality is very good.,1
"My dog considers this his guilty pleasure!  When he gets on it you can tell he's sooooo comfy that he believes he's on my bed!
Well worth the price.  My dog weighs approx. 89 lbs. and yet has plenty of room left.",1
"It is kind of ineffective as far as being a brush goes. However, like all Kong products, it is super durable, so it suffices as a dog toy.",0
didn't work.  I still had to go buy Advantix,0
"The adhesive was dried up in all four tubes, it did not work at all. The friction was dried out and would not stick, even after clipping the hair and nails on my pet. Very disappointing.",0
So insanely easy to use! It's nice to feel more connected with our puppy friends in these open crates.,1
LED lights started dying almost immediately. The wiring inside the collar is cheap and breaks too easily. Avoid,0
works! cats love it.,1
"These are great for my filter, I have two large turtles and I have two 40 gallon whisper filters in their 75 gallon tank. I got 4 months out of a set of these by rinsing them when I did water changes.",1
"if you care about what you give to your dog, then do NOT give them this product.  It does NOT have an ingredients statement, as required by law, they claim that the product has vitamins, but there is not indication or proof as such on the package.  there is no weight statement, as required by law.  there is not nutritional analysis, as required by law.

Exactly what is in this product??? -- who knows...",0
"It says large, but is way too small.",0
This has absolutely no effect on my Golden Retriever...and his hearing is fine!,0
"These were adorable, sturdy and the cats loved them. Good price.",1
Great product with a good price with free two day delivery.  What more could a bird as for.,1
Medium is more Suited for a small dog. Otherwise the quality was good. Shipping took too long to hassle with a return as well.,0
Love but justbwish,1
"Much better looking in person, and very high quality!",1
"I have to admit, I don't have any dogs! These seat covers looked so nice and exactly what I was looking for. I have black leather seats on my VW Passat, they get so hot in the summer. These covers are attractive, fit great and are just enough to keep my seats cool. Maybe I should get a dog to go with my seats! LOL!",1
"After treating my cat with this for the last 2 months, she ended up with fleas snand d tape worms due to the fleas. Now I have a very large vet bill in return. Thays what happens when you try to save a buck bying this type of peoduct online. NEVER BY FLEA OR ANY ANIMAL MEDICATION ONLINE. I LEARNED THE HARD WAY, TRUST ME. ALWAYS GO TO YOUR VET!!!",0
exactly as described,1
BEST BROOM EVER,1
I dropped one star since the battery ran out after 9 days.  I even turned the battery off at night.  I am pleased overall and am ordering another for my Westie.,1
"First of all, my cat did NOT want anything to do with this. She enjoys the crab and salmon, but did not like this. As I looked closer at the food I noticed a lot of cartilage and bones in the meat-- I wonder if this is why my cat did not like it. I cannot imagine that ingesting so much cartilage would be safe. I would NOT recommend this to your cat.",0
"broken  clip pretty much the first day by a little baby yorkie.  i don't recommend this product.  a bit of a design alteration would make it much better.  clip should not be accessible to little teeth.  also sadly, this is cheaply made.",0
"I have no idea why these work, but they do. When one cat-anxious friend came over, I suggested he feed my kitty a treat to make them both more comfortable with each other. Unbeknownst to me, he gave my cat 4 or 5 of them! The result was that kitty fell asleep on his shoulder. I don't necessarily recommend giving that many, but they do work and 1 (or 1 1/2...) usually calms my cat when a change in his environment freaks him out.",1
My dog has had this collar on for one month and we have found three ticks just this morning alone I have found numerous ticks over the last 2 weeks we live in the East. I am frustrated and wondering what else to give. Our previous dog had reactions to the drops that they put on the back of their neck so I was hopeful that this would be a good option since my vet had recommended this but it was expensive and it does not work I am now looking for other alternatives.,0
These arrived on time and we're perfect size however my cat did not like them. We ordered the plastic containers later and the roasted version. Those he ate and loves.,0
Love it,1
Not for my dogs...they chewed the light out. The rest of the ball shows up in the yard every once in a while but is no longer exciting,0
"My 1 yr old dog started chewing on it one night and in the 10 min. his gums started bleeding from the sharp edges. Im very disapointed, as this looked like such a good toy :(",0
"Do not purchase this item.  Before I could take it away from her, our puppy ate almost half of the bone and has been throwing it up all night.  Large chunks of plastic and some blood in there too.  I cannot believe that this item can be sold to the public.",0
We bought this(small) for our frenchie who kept stealing our mastiff's bed. He loves this new bed and it's super easy to wash!,1
This collar looked so great on our pug that I've ordered a second one for our Jack Russell. It's a great color and is really well-made. Highly recommend this brand!,1
"Easily clogs, no power, makes a mess everywhere. Have to clean everyday not once a week like it claims.",0
"Dog tore it to pieces very quickly.  But she does still enjoy shaking the stuffings out of each individual piece, so I think she's still getting pleasure out of it.",0
"Paint chipped off within a few days, rendering blade useless.",0
Im sure its a great product if your horse will eat it. My mare refused to touch it on feed (wet or dry) or hay.,0
Cool looking addition for my nephew's aquarium.,1
Dog chewed it anyway!,0
"Don't buy!!!! I have had and been using for less then 2 weeks and today it broke and my dog ran into the street and was almost hit and killed. My dog is a 5 month old puppy, so it's not that she was too big/strong fro the leash, the leash is just trash. I'm so pissed. Not only did I waste my $$ but I almost lost my dog today",0
A #1 excellentia,1
Great item!,1
"Don't make the mistake that I did!!! I ordered the wrong product! If you are looking for the ""SOFT CHEWS,"" they are totally different from the ""CHEWABLE TABLETS."" My dog will NOT eat the chewable tablets period. Unless you want to smother them in peanut butter. I got a sample of the soft chews from my vet and my dog would eat them right out of my hand like a treat. These chewable tablets he won't go near. Just a warning and heads up to future buyers.",0
This product is constructed just fine.  However our two Bengals haven't touched this toy since we got it. word word,0
"First Impression: Well the kind folks over at Wellness Pet Food heard about my website and sent me some treats to try! They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats. Turns out that WellNess is owned by Old Mother Hubbard. Who knew? As usual Dad ran me though a barrage of tests to see how much I really wanted the treat. Let's just say I had to work very hard. Those silly ""sit ups"" that little dogs do, roll over, sit, stay, down, etc, just to have him put the treats in my Everlasting Treat Ball! I made short work of it and devoured my new delicious and healthy treats. The only thing I'm a little disappointed about is I found out that they have WellBites that are soft treats. They even have one that's Lamb and Salmon flavored... Those are two of my favorite things in the world. Now I have to talk Dad into buying them for me...

Conclusion: Outstanding healthy dog treats! A must buy for a healthy pup.",1
hank loves this thing - our 80lb amstaff - one of a few thing he can't seem to destroy,1
"i love
dogs love
so cool",1
"Our young beagle loves this bed. She is slender and likes to curls up. This bed is soft, plush, cozy, and very well stuffed. However, if your dog wrestles, plays tug-of-war, shakes or digs into his bed like ours does, don't get this one. The description states furniture-quality exterior fabric. What they don't tell you is that the bottom is a dotted non-woven black material similar to what's underneath upholstered furniture. It is very well made, but the underside is easily destroyed by rambunctious canine teeth or nails.

The first time the beagle tore a hole in the bottom and got stuffing out, I mended it with needle and thread. The second time, the bottom was too far gone to salvage. So I constructed a new bottom with fabric. This would be easier to do with the bed intact, adding fabric over the existing bottom. Since I had to do it after it was torn apart, it was quite difficult to duplicate the center inner stuffing pocket arrangement.

Precision Pet makes a quality bed. Too bad they use some weak shoddy material for the underside.

Photos: (1) Great plush bed top (2) I had to replace the bottom with real fabric that won't tear apart.",0
I have 3 dogs and they all LOVE chicken! They loved these treats.,1
Super fast shipping!  A+,1
"This adorable bunny is my golden retriever's new baby. It melts my heart to see her walking around carrying this dangling pink bunny.
It has a flatter body with some crinkly material inside, as well as a squeaker or two. The pink material is like a felt, while the stripes are a jersey cloth material.
So cute!",1
"Be very very very careful if you use this. And not just this but other topical flea and tick medications. I have three dogs - two were fine but the third one, a miniature poodle, reacted badly. Within an hour he was panting. An hour later he was staggering around and falling down. I immediately washed him to get as much off as I could and kept an eye on him throughout the night. The next day I took him to the vet and he was on medication for a week. The part of his coat where I had applied the K9 Advantix burned his skin, and he still has dark patches on his fur even a couple of months later. I read up on this and found out this is not unusual. [Note: I did buy the one for smaller dogs.]",0
"I do love the blue sparkle collar for my black kitten.  However, there is nothing ""break-away"" about this collar. We could not undo the plastic clasp and decided to cut the collar off, in case it is unsafe..

Otherwise would have loved.",0
I'm soooo bummed about this product.  Absolutely not worth it.  I also received a collar where the buckles were seen too close together.  It's not worth more than $12-15 based on quality.  I will be returning it and the leash when the leash gets delivered:-(,0
Love the collar and the company.  This company stands behind their products.  The green collar glows so much brighter than the blue.,1
"The collar was for an active medium sized six month old puppy but after a month or so, two of the metal hole spacers (idk what u call them) came out so the collar looks worn out. Color was nice though.",0
This is an o.k. product. I thought it would be fuller. It is already thead bare. Holes in it. Had to be thrown away!!!!!!,0
Thought the dog came with....embarrassed as I sent as a gift!  Please contact me....,0
"I shouldn't have bothered getting the heated pad. It barely heats up.  My cat loves to sit in front of my heat dish, so I thought she'd like this, but she doesn't care.",0
I bought the wrong item. Im sure it works for what it is indented for,0
Very cute! Good quality. My yorkie looks good in it though we had to make an additional hole for the correct fit. Would recommend to others.,1
"My 9 pound, long haired chihuahua loves it. I think the medium would have been the best size, he loves to have a place to lay his little head. He has complete control of the house, so this just enhances his comfort!",1
"This Mighty Paw leather Dog Collar is a high quality collar. It is very well made. The leather is thick but soft not rough. There are 5 holes in the color for a good fit and the metal and hardware look durable. I hadn't heard of Mighty Paw previously but they look to carry a nice array of items and this collar shows me that they make quality products for the price. Don't overpay for your dog needs. The only thing I had a problem with for this collar is the sizing. I got a large for my male but he needs a xl. I use it with my female and it's a perfect fit. I got the light brown and it's very pretty on her as she is a fawn colored American bully pitbull. My opinion is maybe get the next size up to make sure it fits. Overall I'm definitely pleased with the collar.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1

I seriously am sending all my cat owner friends with dogs a link to this!",1
Really cleans my golden retriever's ears. Be sure to flood the entire ear canal and then message the ear to bring the dirt up.,1
Doesn't last nearly as long as some other brands. The card board piece are all over the place when cats start using. My others last for weeks and used everyday. At the end of one week I had to get rid of. Disappointed,0
Be careful! My cat just had to have surgery to remove the plastic piece that held the feathers together from his intestines. I remember playing with him on Friday and he would pounce on the toy and all of a sudden I realized that the feathers were loose. Like in a matter of a few seconds. I looked all over for the plastic end but I had flung toy away from him once I saw that he was breaking it so easily and figured that it must have been tossed somewhere else. He started to vomit last night and the vet showed me the X-ray and I recognized the missing plastic cap right away:(  I know that I was very attentive with playing with him with this toy and never just left him alone with it but he still easily and surprisingly quickly disassembled and ate the piece and now he's recovering from surgery.,0
This used to be the greatest dog treat ever and it used to work on the dog breath when given as directed but now the dogs do not like it as much as they did and it has not helped with the stink breath.,0
"Extremely Poor Ingredients  and GMO, Wysong utilizes corn and soy as their primary ingredients which will cause serious health problems to say the least.  This brand is very subpar, like shopping at Walmart for food.",0
These lasted exactly 2.5 seconds.,0
"My dogs like these yak cheese sticks. These in particular seem extra smoked, extra hard.",1
I love this harness,1
"We bought this for our 38 pound Australian shepherd. I chose a medium and if fit her fairly well. She wore it for the first time on our 3 day backpacking trip and was running and jumping around- after the initial shock of wearing a pack wore off- she didn't notice it. We used it to pack her dog food,bowl and bendable frisbee and it all fit well. And that was without opening the second zipper to expand the bags. I would recommend it for sure!",1
It was not as advertised.  It may be a good product for another person's dog.,0
I was under the assumption they were smaller and since there was no return policy they are trash.,0
"My favorite thing about these collars is that they aren't too wide for our pugs. My second favorite thing is the great color choices for both the collars and thread. We ordered two for our new 6 month old pug family members, Winnie and Cabo. Everything was exactly right. I liked them so much that I ordered a new personalized collar for queen of the house, 3 year old pug Ruby Tuesday. I plan to order one more collar for our two year old pug ""Prince"" Andy.

I've purchased more expensive embroidered collars at two other sites, and these are just as good. These offer the full array of color choices as well as the more appropriate width we need for our short necked pugs. A longer necked dog can wear a thinner collar, but short necks aren't as safe or comfortable in a wide collar. All of our pugs wear size medium.

I put my ordering info into the gift card message box. I wrote down the instructions for ordering so I wouldn't forget what info I needed to send. With my last order I had difficulty fitting everything into that gift message box. I could have emailed the company with the information, but I got stubborn and persevered until I got everything in.

The dog tag is nice, even though we can't use them because the dogs pull on each other's tags. They're nice tags, we'd use them if we could. All of our dogs are microchipped, but the collars help people know the dog's name when found and call us immediately rather than take the dog into have the chip scanned. We hope that never happens, but we feel better knowing we're doing all we can to protect our beloved pets.

(I'm now also thinking about personalized leads for everyone.)",1
BS - just suck it up - don't feed kibble and clean your dogs teeth,0
I was expecting more after reading the reviews but cat doesnt even touch it. Love Rachel Ray but this was a no no.,0
It didn't work. My animals still have fleas.,0
"We have purchased this pump and assembled it and this pump was so loud we started figuring out what can be done. Put it in the box, put a lot of pillow filler between the walls of the box and the pump - still loud. Put additional pillow on top, then we could still hear it... WOW... why can't it be with good quality parts... Trying to maintain it would be a hassle too - you need at least 3 hands to take out the top. It would do good filtering of the water, but all of this at what price... Hence we have returned it.",0
This works exactly as it should. I should have done the math before buying. The place I'm using this is really too large for this model. Will probably order another one to assist in heating the area.,1
gave this one to a friend with two small dogs they love it,1
"I chose this scratching post because of the positive reviews on the site.  I must have received a different product, because this one is useless.  The post does not screw tightly into the base or the top and the whole thing is very unstable.  It's a good thing Amazon has a good return policy because this one is on its way back.",0
Not a high quality leash.  The outer covering wore off and finally the cord separated from the clicker.  Not a recommended buy,0
This is great stuff! My hamster loves it. It's not dusty at all. I highly recommend and will certainly buy again.,1
durable!,1
"Title says it all, It was easy to put together, But as other people said it was woobly. I finally got it to stop. in the mean time my 4 month old kitten tried to jump on it, I had someone hold him. Once I got it up they let him go and he ran and jumped on it where it fell apart and the kitten ran away. The ends fell off the tubes and I found it was just carpet on cardboard tubes with staples in it, I tried to fix it and the kitten jumped on the second shelve again and more of the tubes lost the plastic ends. do not waste your money on this,
I came here looking for a better cat tree and saw they were selling this one  and just had to warn people, I got mine from Walmart too.",0
Sizes cut small,0
Great tool. I and my dog recommend this tool.,1
Not as I expected. I wanted a thinner material,0
Love the sturdy flexibility.,1

My kittens like the teast. To early to find out if it really works.,1
Cats love it and I am happy to see the cats eat it.,1
Fast delivery great service Cz Garden Supply will buy again.,1
"I bought 2 for my dogs, and the both fit in between the size 17.5-21"" and BOTH the collars didn't fit. One to small, one to big. These collars cost WAY to much not to fit properly. Got a refund immediately.",0
"it was a fair price and my dog wore it for christmas!. no complaints at all, buy your dog one!",1
most of them are burnt and my dogs do not like them at all.  black around the edges in 3 boxes I opened so far out of the 5 I ordered.,0
"This product has made several dogs very ill or even killed. I wouldn't buy this product EVER! Please remove it as one of your products, AMAZON!",0
This thing is pretty durable.  Girls love it.,1
great for your dog,1
I was so disappointed in this product. So many people recommended this product to me so I got it for my dog. It did not get rid of the fleas at all. I can't say whether it works on ticks or not because we are fortunate not to have many here. My dog only goes outside to use the bathroom and she's got fleas. Will not be purchasing this again in the future.,0
Wouldn't eat it.,0
"It was easy for my twelve year old daughter and me to assemble. It helps to have two people to assemble it. It came with assembly tools. The trickiest part was identifying the pieces. It works very well for my daughter's three ferrets. She had just adopted another ferret and we did not know if the ferrets would get along. So we wanted a unit that was versatile enough to work as one cage or two cages, just in case. The three ferrets get along so we use it as one big cage. We like the easy access to the ferrets, easy access to clean the cage, and the casters that make it easy to move the cage. The storage area below the cage is convenient as well.",1
Cheap and arrived broken.,0
"I tell you! This pattern is AWESOME. The Bronze color has a metallic tint to it! Lupine products are wonderful and very well made! I rave about them a lot. But its the truth! And their guarantee just makes them even better! The collar is good for medium to large sized dogs(medium as in 40-50 pounds or more.) Its 1 inch thick so it would look funny on my sheltie, who is considered a medium size dog at 30 pounds.",1
dogs loved it,1
"This is a very strong retractable leash. It works on my very hyper 70 lbs GSD puppy and 90 lbs husky. I have been using them for 5 months now and they still are as good as new. Very lightweight and durable. I would definitely buy again, but it does not look like I'll have to for a long time, unless I adopt another dog!",1
"It was a waste of money for me.  I might as well be whispering to get my dogs attention.  I suppose if you have one dog and are within 5 feet of the dog, it may work. I have six, free-range dogs who  like to join the coyotes in a howlathon and it has no effect at all.",0
These collars have been nothing but trouble for me. They constantly lose connection. I go to use it and nothing happens. I have to continually turn the collar back on because it shuts off. Extremely unreliable. The remote control is not laid out well. If you need to use it in a pinch you have to check and make sure it's on the right setting and then make sure it's on the right frequency for the collar you need to use. It is not made for quick reactions. I regret buying these so much.,0
I love the smell. Its almost like citronella but sweeter. I have no clue as to how it keeps the bugs off since it smells so good. But it works great.,1
"Did not work out for my puppy, she just chewed on the edges of the grass and I had to keep taking it out of her mouth.",0
Perfect for what we needed it for!!!,1
"I have no idea what is ACTUALLY in this, but my healthy 4 yo tabby throws up every single time after consuming it. I portion all of his feedings so I know he's not overeating. I don't know if the food is ""counterfeit"" like so many things here on Amazon, but he stomachs Purina cat naturals (purchased locally at the pet store) just fine. I know that many foods and creams for humans on here is fake and won't buy anything on here for myself, so I'm feeling a bit guilty for taking the risk with the cat food. Either way, I won't be buying this brand again. Poor kitty will be getting something else purchased from a reputable store from now on.",0
Material is too hard and could cause your dog to chip a tooth,0
"I purchased the 25' version of this to clean my 55 gallon tank for my red eared slider. It doesn't plug into my kitchen sink, and doesn't reach my bathroom, but that is not necessarily a defect on the manufacturer as I should have ordered a longer hose. My main problem is that the suction is not very strong, and the tube gets clogged at the top (where it connects to the hose). Every time it clogs I have to stop, drain the hose, clean the tube, and begin again. If you only have fish, you might be ok, but for a turtle and their waste try something else. I'm planning on getting the python...",0
I returned this order only because I had ordered a large carrier and was sent a small.  I love the Bergen Carrier.  I haven't heard back from Coastal Pet Products.,0
"Well, we found our poor cat convulsing in a corner this morning because his collar was shocking him repeatedly and we didn't know it!!!! It shocked my husband as we were trying to get it off him. As you can see it is cover in hair and slobber as he was trying to get it off!! I'm so angry!! DO NOT GET THIS COLLAR! it never worked and it severely hurt my pet!!!",0
I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old golden retriever and he absolutely loves it! It's very durable and has not ripped yet (we have had it for almost a week).,1
"Good quality product! No complaints whatsoever. I would recommend this to others.
Update: Not long after our dog started wearing this the info was scratched up really easily and you could barely read it. Not good if he were to ever get lost!",0
"This is without doubt the best retractable leach we have ever had so far with having 8 dogs of all sizes during the last 55 years from miniture poodle to St. Bernard. It is far superior to the string type leashes ,easy to use and well constructed.",1
"I had a little dog that barked at everything and didn't care about consequences... this did not work for her. But the other dog barks just as much and immediately quiets down when this is turned on, even seems to walk carefully as if trying not to make noise.",1
"At first I was put off by the price of this litter box, but I am so glad that I took the plunge.  We live in a two-bedroom condo so there's not a lot of room to keep a litter box.  The furthest place away from the kitchen was in our master bathroom bathtub.  This meant never being able to take a bath because of the litter box being in there all the time.  My cat also kicked litter everywhere and even managed to drag litter out with her when she jumped out of the tub.  I was concerned she might be too big for this box because she is a large, long and lean 12 lb cat.  I set the Modkat Litter Box up in front of the bathtub near the old litter box, and put some of the old litter into the new box so she would recognize the scent.  It took a couple of days, but eventually my cat investigated and eventually used the new Modkat box.  She looks kind of big in there but it doesn't seem to bother her in the least.  After a couple of uses, I took the old one away and she's been exclusively using the Modkat box.  There is way less litter spray on the bathroom floor and I get my bathtub back!  I use this in combination with Precious Cat Ultra Premium Cat Litter and this box/litter combo has literally changed my life.  The bathroom is much cleaner and basically odor free.  The Modkat box is super easy to clean as well.  I like the liner because my cat tends to pee near the edge of the box and it is easier to scrub away the clumped litter from the liner than it was to remove it from the sides of the old plastic box.  I am very happy with this purchase.",1
Really caught the attention of our Shih Tzu,1
Love it! Very tough for strong chewers!,1
This was a worthwhile upgrade from the original. The well in the back makes it so I don't have to refill it daily and the pets love it!,1
Having difficulty keeping them in place.,0

as advertised,1
Good product.,1
"It's not a thick bucket however it's not thin either. It's working great. It has been below freezing for 8 days now, but did a few modifications.
1st---I purchase a temperature controlled outlet adapter that turn the outlet on @36 degrees because it does stay on as long as it's plugged in. (Had to make a modification to that because our outlet is recessed by adding an adapter) Our temps can swing wildly. One day is 40 the next in the teens. I get busy and forget to unplug it and our dogs don't like the water heated up.

2-- we placed the bucket with the flat side to the house. This alone will help it to freeze much slower but also we have a rambunctious young male dog who is playful. He used to turn over the old bucket. The flat side against the wall stopped that.

3--- My husband dug a 10"" deep hole size of the bottom of the bucket and filled it with 4"" of rocks. This helped to insulate it and force the heat upward instead of escaping the sides. Even in 8 degree weather the entire bucket was ice free. If you dig it a little too big around, just pile and pack the dirt tightly back around it when you are done to help seal it off. Don't bury it too deep and make it hard for dogs to drink out of. rocks under the bucket are for drainage to keep from drowning it out if you over fill the bucket and the ring of dirt that around it becomes saturated.

No more breaking ice for me!",1
"i love this my dogs smell great it makes them look great i will be purchasing more of this shampoo
Thank you",1
"I bought this for my dog who has skin allergies. He hasn't been scratching as much and loves the taste of the oil. He eats all his food right away, where before he would wait to eat. Very satisfied",1
The plant I received was mostly yellow and sparse.  Not good quality.,0
This is our second one; the first lasted several years and has only now begun to fray.  My Cathoula normally shreds cloth toys or chews plastic or rubber toys to bits in under an hour (especially if there's a squeaker in them).  Love this toy!,1
"Great quality dog tag. Came promptly, affordable and good quality material. Very easy to customize as well. Every dog should have this quality dog tag.",1
Did not work  had a hole in it to big for cat could stick head through it on end,0
Horrendous quality. Complete waste of money. My pit mix with only minor to medium use at the dog park shredded through two balls in two days. Avoid at all costs.,0
"The food itself is great. The packaging is terrible. Though it is resealable, I highly recommend just pouring the whole bag into a separate container and throwing it away.",1
"I was very dissapointed.... we have an identical toy that the squeaker is worn out, when we received the new one they had substituted a striped ball of the same material...but Rocky doesnt like it! it still prefers the old toy",0
My dog has a habit of covering up his water bowl with his blanket. This helped solve the wet blanket problem.,1
"My dogs love these ""cookies"", they have a lot of healthy ingredients and are just the right size, about 2"" long x 1"" wide.",1
"We currently have four always indoors cats, we have had as many as six at one time.  We have owned as many as two Litter Maids at one time and experienced the same problem with all of them.  First the solid waste sticks to the forks and is difficult to clean.  Second the trays are expensive and messy to change.  I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve, but at over $1.00 each they are still too much.

We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it.  It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone.  We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.

If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.  With the ninety-day money-back guarantee you have nothing to loose and I believe you will not want to return it.

See my full review of the Scoop Free by going to the product or my clicking on ""See all of my review"" link here.",0
"This is abuse for your betta. It is their natural defense mechanism to scare away other male bettas. All this contraption does is stress your betta out not ""strengthen fins"". if your not careful they can start biting their own fins off. Horrible product.",0
"We ordered the medium and the large for our 5 new kittens and we love it! We used the large for the living room and the medium for our bedroom. They're all under 2 months so this is perfect because our house is huge and we have an older cat. They love to climb the netting, but it's really durable. Easy clean up. The take down is a bit tricky, but it's not too bad!",1
"Did nothing.  My dog had bleeding paws either from walking or some injury.  It was raw between her pads and awful.
This product did nothing with use as labeled.

USE BABY SOCK!
You can use baby socks and some medical tape to keep from licking wound!!!!
Put on baby sock and NOT TIGHT wrap sock above paw (around ankle) with medical tape to keep it on.  Works perfect and if it takes a long time to heal you can either throw them out (got a pack of TEN PAIR WALMART >$7) or throw them in the wash!

Wound finally healed on own. No help to this product.",0
Our pup loves this product mixed with her kibble and the sauce leftover... and prices comparable to shopping at Petco/PetSmart.,1
The crisps are so much better than soft flake- easy to crumble for smaller fish but it doesn't dissolve and clog filter,1
Easy to install in my new 4XL and no problems feeding or printing.  Works just like brand name labels.,1
Great toy and a great price. Both my dogs love these roller toys.,1
"It was labeled as extra large, but I suppose I really need an XXXXX-Large shell for Goliath my Hermit Crab.  Still trying to find out where I can purchase the size he needs....he'll be finished molting by the end of September!",0
"Got it today and used it my Norwegian Forest cat who has a very long coat and a very thick undercoat. He gets some matting after an annual molt, mostly on his belly and under the legs.  Used the tool and and did an amazing job removing the fur clumps. I feel safe using it because of the rounded teeth that grasp and gently cut through the fur without any danger of poking the skin.  I also used it to brush through his top coat, and it easily removed all the ""lose"" hair. Wish I knew about this earlier. Very happy with the product!",1
I ordered a Guyot Designs Squishy Pet Bowl in Tangerine 36 oz. I got a 32 oz and the tangerine color is not the same as the other tangerine bowls I bought at a local camping store. so I'm concerned this may be a knock off. Color isn't that big of a factor it still functions just fine but it is not what I expected. Also if I pay for something I expect it to be what I payed for. I think thats something we can agree on. I was expecting 36 oz but was shorted 4 oz. Very irritating but the hassle of returning it and getting a new one that I feel will not be what I ordered either isn't worth it. I will just wait to my local outdoor shop gets this bowl in before I buy more. If this had been what I was expecting this review would of been much better. The bowl functions great it's a fantastic idea so if you're willing to gamble and not get color and size right go for it.,0
My one kitty loves these and has been playing with them a lot. They slide across hard floors nicely.,1
This product was a complete waste of money!!! My husband tasted out the shock on himself first and it is so weak you can barley feel it and that was testing all buttons!! Put it on my 35 pound dog and he wasn't even fazed by it! Do not wasted your money. If you want a shock collar go get a good one. Don't waste your money thinking of this will do the trick because it's a waste of time and money. So disappointed. I've only had this collar for 4 days! So angry,0
"I bought these ultra paws rugged in X large black for my 12o lb Bullmasif. The Company's sizing chart was accurate. Been using daily for about a month.  We were replacing another pair from a different brand.  These stay on, even in snow, are easy on and off, have a nice no slip vibram type outer sole and she seems to be comfortable in them for long periods.  The old shoes used to slip off, turn around, and pretty much drove her crazy on slippery surfaces.  We got these to protect against the pad cuts and infections she gets from sharp icy conditions here in New England.  At 120 lbs, stepping on the jagged frozen ground or into snow without knowing what was under it, is a health hazard.  These seem to have solved the problem.  Very well designed.  In hindsight, I should have gotten the brighter colored ones instead of black just in case one comes off (easier to find red than black), but so far that has not been an issue.  They also breathe well and appear to be very durable.",1
"I am so disappointed in these collars. I bought two mediums (different colors) and was so unhappy to see that they appear to be larges that they just adjusted into a medium.  I have a small (12.5lbs) Shi Tzu and bought the recommended size, medium when I received it the collar cannot be me smaller due to the fact it already is adjusted to the smallest possible size. Basically the collar is doubled which makes it super thick and heavy. Way to heavy for a small dog......I was really sad about this and even looked to see if I could trim it down but do to the end being sewn together it can't be modified....It is very soft and was very pretty and bright...exactly what I was looking for.....",0
very good,1
She just LOVEs this food.... only problem I have is trying to slow her down from gulping it while eating!,1
"Maybe we let our grass get too long or perhaps our large black lab just makes messes that are too taxing, but the GoGo stick broke within a couple months of use. The handle broke off at the top, and left a pretty rough edge. The rubber section that you pull the bag through kept pulling away from the stick.",0
the best for my dogs.,1
"I have 4 dogs and now they are all wearing this collar . I take my dogs swimming at the beach a lot of times,now I don't have to worry about changing their collar or having lots of pet tags for each collar. This one simply has everything,the tag attached,easy to clean,comfortable for the dogs so they can wear it 24/7. Only thing I have to do now is attach a leash and we're ready to go anywhere. Not only they are great and safe but they are very pretty. I have 2 solid blue,1 solid pink and 1 translucent orange.

Would recommend this to any pet owner!

A+ product.",1
"Love my drinkwell but you do have to have a reservoir but DO NOT PUT IT IN THE DISHWASHER - as I did mine - it shriveled up to a mess, even though it was on the top shelf - they do not sell them locally in pet stores you have to find them on line -- I LOVE my Drinkwell original - HATE the other models, and in fact have given a large one away just a few weeks after getting it.  But this reservoir is a MUST.",1

"I have a 12-yr old Doberman-mix female dog who within the last year has slowed down a bit on walking and has difficulty standing up and going up stairs.  After a few weeks on these chewable pills, Nikki, has started playing with her toys again and runs up the stairs.  Not only that, she loves the flavor of the pills and eats them without any coaxing!",1
"Wrong advertising!  They say it's for puppies 0 to 10 pounds. My puppy is 3 pounds. Package arrived, said it was only for puppies from 4 to 10 pounds. I shopped around a lot. I spent a lot of time . Did not really appreciate this little typo. My time is valuable. If they would've told me upfront that it was the same thing I was looking at that other sites I wouldn't have spent the time or the money.",0
Our cat loves this tree. Fairly sturdy but our cat climbs right up the side so we took a board and mounted to the wall for stability. The top bed is too small to nap on so we took it off and put a piece of plywood and her bed on top. She sleeps on her bed or the larger cubby. So far worth the money.,1
Puppies not interested,0
Great that it's 5 feet and has 12 squeakers but my 25lb dog went through 8 out of 12 squeakers in less than an hour.  I thought this was supposed to last forever???,0
Doesn't work. Won't kill them but does help for a day or two. I applied it every day for ten days and they still weren't gone. I use it now just to keep the number down. I've tried two products. Over the counter products just don't seem to work.,0
"Absolutely the best seed for my African Grey. Tried it and he loved it right off the bat! Unlike his other food, he never wastes this seed. Amazing!",1

This is the loudest pet water syatem. I drove me crazy. The adjustable level was useless. All plastic construction.,0
"I was so excited to try out the new Clump & Seal cat litter, and yesterday, I poured it into a completely clean and empty litterbox. I believe in leading off with the positives...what do I love about Clump & Seal? Well, there was no dust, a big plus. It seems to be harder for my 2 cats to track than their other litter (Fresh Step Extreme), for which I'm sure my vacuum is thankful, so that was a plus.

But that's all outweighed by the only downside...the downside being that, less than 24 hours after putting it into a clean, empty litterbox, the air around said litterbox now smells like a nauseating blend of fresh litter and...well...no-so-fresh litter. I have a really good nose, but even with that in mind, it *definitely* smells like fresh AND old litter.

I can see where this product would be awesome for a one-cat household, however, I found that when there is more than one cat involved, the odor control is nearly non-existent. I've used regular Arm & Hammer clumping litter, and even that stays fresh-smelling for at least two days before the odor is noticeable.

I gave it two stars because I don't *hate* it...but the two upsides I found (no dust and no tracking) just don't outweigh or even balance the one massive downside (poor odor control).

Unfortunately, I will be making the switch back to Fresh Step Extreme, but only because I can't stand smelling a litter box less than a day after I cleaned it. My vacuum will just have to suffer, I suppose.",0
Ordered this as a gift for the dog in watching to take back home with her. They are Hawkeyes fans so I ordered believing it would be yellow and black. Very disappointed to get a pink and blue one. No where did I see options to select color or say colors vary. My dogs have one of these and they're great toys but I'd have like to get the color portrayed in the image.,0
Cats are easily able to escape.  Had to by extra locks to keep cat in.,0
"My dog has been fed pedigree small dog chicken since November of 2012. I tried buying it for the first time in January 2017 through Amazon. The food is NOT the same as I have ever bought for my dog before. The color is darker, and it has made her sick. She started throwing it up and will not touch her food or the food bowl now. Will never buy dog food from here again. No idea if it was a fluke bag or if it was mishandled, either way it was not safe for her to eat.",0
A little bigger than I expected as I have a very small breed puppy. But she enjoys chewing on the end of the keys very well.,1
The Halo salmon treats are the only treat I've found that my cat will actually eat. Yes they have a strong smell- but they are salmon and it's supposed to smell like salmon! The price here on amazon is great!,1
"Great and nifty GPS tracker. Pros: pretty reliable up-to-the-minute tracking and out-of-bounds updates via app and email. Will update you with an address along the route that you took your dog. Clarity of mind. Very affordable and inexpensive monthly plan.
Cons: sometimes laggy up-to-the-minute tracking. And, a few times, we received emails that our dog was some place that she wasn't, which caused us to speed back home only to find (thankfully) that she was still inside. Also, it's pretty bulky and not at all easy to take off in the event that you want to switch collars.",1
"Had it for 3 days now and the plastic/chemical smell that was there since day 1 didn't dissappear, was not surprised to see that my cats avoided it and kept meowing until I gave them their old water bowl. Found out it was the large foam filter, washed it with soap and warm water and then ran it under water for 5 or so minutes. They enjoyed their non-stinky water immediately. Please check your newly purchased foam filter... this was a poor start, lets see how the motor holds up.

Couple of Pros: multiple spout attachments and fairly large.",0
"I am posting this for my birds. They love these beds. They don't sleep in it, they flip it up side down and crawl under it. What can I say, except they love them. I will be buying more.",1
Great product (LED); remote not user friendly,1
"My dog was getting poisoned with it.  She stopped eating and she was feeling nausea all the time. I spent thousand of dollars in vets, tests and different types, brands and flavors of food and nothing.  Until I read an article about this causing harm and poison. I stopped giving it to her and two days after she was back to normal.  Be careful with this",0
"I think half the reviewers don't realize these sweaters are for puppies and not dogs, so yes, the sizing is not accurate if you're trying to purchase a sweater for a large dog.  I bought the XXL size knowing it would be a tight fit for my medium sized 20 lb dog.  I actually measured my dog.  They have a sizing guide in the description.  I think my dog looks cute in the sweater.  She hates it, of course.  The hood is too small to go over her head, but that could be a puppy/dog issue as well.",1
Love my dog hair!!,1
"Very thin, hard to use especially with my Pug's small mouth. Do not see that it removes much material.",0
"Samy ""the cat"" knew just when the UPS driver was pulling up with his order of Armarkat.  The minute we brought this package into the door, Samy was anxiously scratching at the box.  We pulled out the pieces and he very happily played with the scratch posts and toys while we assembled his new condo.  It was incredible......as we were installing the last few pieces, we couldn't get him off of this new home.....is is laced with catnip???  Anyhow, it took us only 15 minutes to assemble - very, very easy to do, no pieces missing, order shipped on time and the material this company uses isn't cheap looking at all (color as well - a very nice beige).  Needless to say, he hasn't left his post in over 6 hours.......we love it, but I must confess, Samy loves it even better.  Thank you Armarkat for putting out such a wonderful product.  I'm very, very pleased and as always, AMAZON....you always deliver ON TIME AND NEVER DISAPPOINT!  THANK YOU!!!!",1
This product works great when it is executed properly.  The product however went off (more than once) when my dog didn't bark.  He was laying on the floor sleeping when it went off.  It's unfortunate because when it worked properly it was very effective.,0
"This was a DNA test for my puppy to determine her breed(s). We followed the instructions and returned the swabs, but have not received any data from this seller/ company.",0
this pad holder is ok.  I could never find a pad that would fit properly (same dimensions) as the holder.  So in my opinion - its just ok...,0
This unit was basically ineffective in quieting down the dogs,0
"This is a good little trimmer for small dogs with thinner hair. Unfortunately my lhasa/shitzu mix has too thick of hair when it's long because it has a double-coat and clogs the blades so I need to clear it often. If his coat is already short, it works ok, but this trimmer can't handle when his coat grows long. Overall, it's a good, basic trimmer.",1
"It was the size described but unfortunately ""large"" wasn't enough for my cat. Needed to find a extra large bag otherwise my cat felt smushed and looked uncomfortable in this bag. Otherwise, it was built well and looked comfortable as a lounge tent for the cat.",1
I ordered two wheels. Both of them were out of shape when they arrived. I was very disappointed and I couldn't fix them.,0
"I had 2 older model Littermaid boxes. They worked fine but they had a built-in design problem (planned obsolescence ?) so they only lasted a couple of years each. The power cord for the scooper would eventually break from metal fatigue at which point the scooper was dead. I bought the new model because Littermaid fixed the power problem by redesigning how the scooper worked. Unfortunately, although the power cord was fixed, the overall operation of the unit was vastly inferior to the previous models. The new scooper is supposed to slide on plastic rails but it always jams. The motor unit can't figure out when to stop backing up. The scooper itself is under powered. The older units worked fine; this new one almost never works. Save yourself the aggravation and the money. Based on my experience, I can't recommend this Littermaid product.",0
"it's wobbly :( I've tried to balance it with self sticking tabs for under the metal base, but it's obviously bent. Poorly made.",0
Works well at controlling my dog who weighs 60 lbs and liked to pull me. Good quality.,1
It worked one day then jammed the second. I thought it was the battery so I replaced with another brand new one and it did the same thing.,0
I use this in my field of work as a dog groomer and it is hands down the best rotary tool for filing nails. I recommend it to anyone wanting to file their dogs nails efficiently!,1
"My pitbull didn't like it at first.  It was his first deer antler.  But when I came back in the house an hour later, I found that he was loving it.  He's been carrying it to every room he goes in for the last 24 hours.",1

"Sadly after having this same harness for 4 years with no issues the new one would fray at the seems after just a few walks. Got it replaced the first time, but the second time it was just past it's return period and we were stuck. Never even got a reply from the manufacturer on it either.",0
"Only one left of shock. And it is so low that my cat doesn't even care about it. She has learned to just run right past it down the hallway into the rest of the house. I've tested it several times, and while it works, the shock is so low as to not deter her at all. She's a 16-lb behemoth of a cat. I've made sure the contacts were right up against her skin. The only saving grace is that it also beeps, so I know to get up and chase her back to her end of the house.",0
Excellent for eye stain!! Others just do not work well.,1
Stitched well. Loud squeaker.,1

"This bed has been used by my Queensland Heeler for several months now, it is on hardwood floor. The edges are very fluffy with the bottom being very lightly padded. It would be a much better bed if the entire bottom was padded like the edge was, my dog will lay on it but still prefers the pillow-top mattress. It has been through the wash several times and comes out clean. It lightly sheds but nothing too extreme, some fleece shedding is expected.",0

"ShooTag is dangerous for older, ill or weakened pets since it can make them even sicker.
Hopefully this will help save some pets' lives! (see my original review,(below) about a tragic story of a friend who unwittingly killed his sweet 1 year old cat by using the highly toxic Hartz and Advantage flea killer products on her.)

Update 03/28/14: I used to use these cat flea Shootags with great success until the last ones I bought from Amazon several months ago which didn't work at all.

On their packaging, the manufacturing company, ShooTag says they have a product guarantee and that sometimes the tags are defective, so they suggest calling the company directly to get usage instructions, or, if necessary, a replacement. So I called the company to ask them why my tag might not be working when 3 tags that I'd used in the past had worked great. I had to keep calling them and leaving messages repeatedly until they finally called me back. They said that yes, I had been doing everything correctly and agreed to send me a replacement flea tag for my cat.

That replacement tag finally arrived a couple weeks later and after letting it charge for over a week on my very healthy, young cat (the same cat that the previous tags HAD worked on), I realized that THAT NEW one wasn't working either. I knew it wasn't working because every day I was still combing about 30 new fleas off my cat every time she went out into the yard.

I was beginning to think that the company had started to make the tags weaker so that they would need to be replaced more quickly since I'd never had any problems in the past and I was always using them on the same cat in the same state of great health. Or they may have had to make the tags weaker because they were causing too many animals to get sick from them.

By the way, do NOT use these tags on a cat or any animal that is not in optimal health. I discovered this the hard way when I tried to use the first tag someone gave to me as a gift, on my elderly cat (the cat I had before the one I have now). My 19 year old sweet cat was pretty healthy for her age except for a small tumor which had shown up on her abdomen 3 years before. It wasn't growing at all and the vet agreed that since she was already so old, and the tumor wasn't growing at all, that it was best not to operate on her to remove it since the surgery would probably kill her before the tumor would.

Back then, ShooTag was not including ANY warnings about not using their tags on elderly or sick animals so I had no idea that I would be putting my sweet cat in danger by trying out this new flea tag on her. Frankly, at that time, the company was not even aware that the tags could be dangerous for weakened or elderly animals. I actually alerted them to the fact after my 19 year old cat had such a strong, adverse reaction to the tag. What happened? Well, within 24 hours of putting the ShooTag on my 19 year old cat with the tumor that hadn't grown or changed in over 3 years. that same tumor swelled up to the size of a walnut and burst open. I can only imagine how painful that was for my poor cat. I had to rush her to the vet to get the wound cleaned out and have her put on antibiotics. I immediately realized it was the ShooTag that had almost killed her so I quickly took it off her.
I had already had some reservations about using the tag on her in the first place, knowing that the tag would actually be using her energy to charge itself (I've studied a lot about the science of living energy fields), but I erroneously assumed that the company would have been responsible and tested their tags on a variety of animals prior to selling them, and that they would have included any necessary warnings if the tags were at all potentially dangerous. At that point there were NO warnings whatsoever on their products or website (although now there are). So as soon as her tumor swelled up and burst open, I knew it was because the ShooTag was depleting energy from her energy field which she couldn't afford to give up. The fact that there had been no warning whatsoever on the packaging was extremely irresponsible. Clearly, there had been very insufficient testing done of this product before it was quickly rushed to market. Like I said, the company now DOES warn that you should not use their products on sick or elderly animals because they ""do not react well to our product"". I'll say!

Anyway, after getting the replacement tag that also did not work (on my new young cat (my older cat has since passed away)), I called the company again, and left a message asking for another replacement since the new one they sent me STILL didn't work. And I called. And I called. And I called, each time leaving a detailed message. But no call back. Ever. They basically just ignored me since they'd already sent me a replacement once. At that point, since it had taken so long to get the replacement tag, I couldn't even get a refund from Amazon since it was past the 30 day deadline. So basically I wasted the money on this dud of a purchase.

I recommend NOT buying ANY tags from this company. I've tried the mosquito and fly repellent tags for humans, also made by this company, and those don't work at all, either!

Save your money and buy something else (but don't get the toxic poisons! (see my original review below to learn why):

Original Review before the company and their products went downhill (2012):

I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this product. (Update: Well, now I know why!)
I'm on my second year (and my third tag) using this product now with my cat who spends most of her time outdoors in my flea infested back yard. How do I know the yard is flea infested? Because when I first started using these Shootags over a year ago, on this sweet stray (who I officially adopted 6 months after I started putting the tags on her and who is now my indoor AND outdoor cat), she had numerous fleas on her the first time I flea combed her. I saw her scratching a lot and thought I'd help her out by combing some of the fleas off of her. (Btw, the only way to know for sure if the scratching your cat is doing is from fleas is by using a flea comb on them. If they're scratching and you don't comb any fleas off of them, they may have an allergy to something (like their food, for example))

Since someone had given me a shootag flea and tick set as a gift (for my elderly 19 year old cat who seemed to have had a bad reaction to the tag when I tried it on her), I put that first flea shootag on the stray to try to give her some relief from the scratching. I combed her before applying the tag, found numerous fleas and then put the flea tag on her. Within 2 days, I combed her again and was now no longer finding any fleas. I combed her again every few days after that and still no fleas.

I was somewhat skeptical that this little tag could be working so well, so on 3 separate occasions, I removed her collar and shootag, and the very next time she came in the house, she had several fleas on her (again, I know this because I combed her). I put the collar back on her the following day after my test and by the next day, no more fleas again (the collar takes about 24-48 hours to 'charge' the magnetic strip from the cat's energy field. (Yes, this may sound bizarre to some if you don't understand the mechanism and how living energy fields work, but it's true).

Anyway, after doing this same experiment two more times (combing before and after removing the collar and sending her outside) I know it's the shootag that is repelling the fleas. (Update: this refers to the original ShooTags from before 2012 when they started to make the tags much weaker and ineffective).

For the record, I would NEVER use those toxic Frontline, Advantage or Hartz flea killing products on my sweet pet. After learning about the neurotoxic effects of them several years ago from my veterinarian while I was living in Italy, I stopped using them altogether (most vets here in the States are clueless as to how toxic all those flea killing products are (well, the vets in this country DO get kickbacks for every flea killing drug they sell through their offices, so you may be able to understand why they don't bother to investigate).

Sadly, last year a friend of mine in Lumberton, North Carolina, inadvertently killed his very sweet one year old cat by using Frontline on her. Well, actually, HE didn't kill the cat. His vet did. The cat had been picking up a lot of fleas from their yard and he wanted to keep her from bringing the fleas into the house so he applied Frontline to the back of her neck (per directions). But after he applied the Frontline, the previously perfectly healthy cat started showing signs of neuro toxicity (ie she started having slight convulsions and semi-paralysis).

He rushed the little cat to the vet and told the woman vet that he thought he may have poisoned the cat with the Frontline (since her symptoms started a day after he applied the liquid to her neck). At that point, the vet SHOULD have flushed out the cat's system and given her IV fluids to flush the toxins from her system ... if she'd had a brain and was using it, that is. (At this point they still could have easily saved the cat's life).

Instead, what did the stupid vet do? She applied yet ANOTHER neurotoxin to the poor cat's neck - this one was Advantage flea killer (she stupidly thought the cat was having a reaction to all the flea bites and thought she'd load her up with even more poison!?!) I was shocked and appalled when I heard this after the fact! Of course, within another 24 hours, the cat's system overloaded and by the following day, after multiple seizures and full body paralysis, the poor little cat died a terrible, agonizing death.

And if you can believe it, the vet took absolutely NO responsibility for her actions, even when my friend did some research on the web and sent her all sorts of documentation about the toxic effects of those flea killer products with the EXACT same symptoms his cat had been having.

Google it for yourself and see just how many people have inadvertently killed their beloved pets by using these flea killer products and/or shortened their pets' lives significantly by using these toxic products on them.

Think about it, would you go around 24 hours a day with your hands immersed in turpentine? NO, because you're not an idiot and you know how toxic that stuff is and how it gets into your blood stream directly through the skin. It's the same thing with these 'U.S. veterinary approved' neurotoxin flea killing products (and they ALL fall into this category). YES, they WILL kill the fleas on your pet, but a high percentage of these toxic substances get absorbed directly into your cat (or dog's) body through their skin. And guaranteed, if you're using them, you ARE shortening your pet's lifespan.

IN Italy, these products are not at all promoted or endorsed by veterinarians, although you CAN buy them...but ONLY if you have a prescription from your veterinarian! The vets there want to be sure that before someone resorts to using one of these toxic products on their pet, that they are fully informed of the risks. Then and ONLY then, will they write you the prescription to purchase any of these topically applied flea killing products.

With this Shootag system, they say there are absolutely no health risks to your pet (Update: SCRATCH THIS STATEMENT - SEE ABOVE - there ARE health risks that were not known at the time I wrote this original review which I found out firsthand with my elderly cat).

Oh, and one other thing, the tags are supposed to last for 3 months, but I've found that they actually last about 4-6 months before the fleas start showing up on her again. (UPDATE: this is no longer true - the new, weaker tags don't work at all).

UPDATE CLOSING COMMENTS AND SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES:
Too bad these tags don't work anymore... it was a great product until they made it so weak it no longer works anymore. I'm guessing there may have been some potential lawsuits from the tags almost killing or killing someone's pet, so they had to make them much weaker... but in doing so, they're now so weak that they don't work at all.
Of course this is just speculation based on my own direct experiences with these tags on an elderly vs a healthy cat, as well as my knowledge of living energy fields. But it's a pretty good guess.

In any case, the tags no longer work and I suggest you simply treat your yard with nematodes and use diatomaceous earth to treat the interior of your house. Both are completely non-toxic to both humans and pets. They are 100% natural and work to kill fleas by basically cutting through their exoskeleton, thereby killing them (you can google this for more info).

Using this method of treating your yard and home, even if the fleas jump on your cat from another yard, they can't survive in diatomaceous earth or outdoors in a treated yard. Fleas only jump on your pet to feed, and spend the rest of the time living in the dirt or in your floorboards or carpet where they breed and lay eggs (oh, and the Diatomaceous earth and nematodes also kill the newborn fleas so you completely kill off the cycle of fleas within about 4-6 weeks.

That's what I'm going to do this year. It's very inexpensive to treat the inside of your house (Flea Busters will do it for you for cheap. It's cheaper to treat your yard by yourself though. You can buy nematodes at Home Depot or online very reasonably and one treatment should last all season.

Just don't buy Frontline or Advantage or Hartz or any of those toxic products, whatever you do! :)",0

"this is the smaller version of their water fountain, and I like it even more; there was nothing much wrong with the larger model i bought some time ago, but it took a lot of water to fill up, and seemed a more appropriate size for a medium dog, although my cat was fine with it.  this one is great - the filter seems to be a better fit, so I think it may actually filter more effectively (the dark blue model had the donut filter sitting on top of the lower plastic platform, with gaps between it and the walls where water would seep through).  what I really like is the red floating level indicator (larger model has a cut-out in the plastic which is really hard to see).  the motor is a little growly, but only when the water is running low.  and it's easy to clean - the plastic clip that holds the motor cable pops right off, take out cone, filter holder, motor, wash, and you're done.  great product!

Four days later, my dog is still scratching. A week passes and my dog is still scratching, and so I gave her the second dose thinking that maybe I had given her the first dose too close to her bath (Her bath was 5 days prior to the first dose, by the way. The package says that's enough time). 2 weeks later, my dog has more fleas than ever and I'm left hoping I have enough money when I get paid to buy her an alternative treatment.

"UPDATE 9/4/14

I have been able to eliminate the problem of the wet mattress by placing it inside a large heavy duty garbage bag (making sure it was completely dry first), and then placing the cover over it. This has made a tremendous difference in the upkeep of the mattress. The cover is holding up great after multiple  washings. And our now 13 year old dog loves it. (So does the 17 year old cat.)

Original review:

There are many things to like about this bed, but one big one to dislike- this bed is in no way waterproof.

First of all, the foam mattress is wonderful- my husband joked that he was going to switch beds with our dog when we received the bed. We purchased this bed for a 12 year old German Shepherd and have noticed that she does seem to be able to stand more easily after sleeping on this product. I also love the heavy duty removable covers. I sew myself, and had thought about making my own covers for a bed, but these are as well made as what I would have done. They are easy to remove and wash well.

My only complaint on the product, it that the ""waterproof"" bed, is in no way waterproof. Our dog leaks urine in her sleep, and every morning, there is a huge wet spot in the middle of the bed that seeps through to the floor. Luckily, the bed is on a slate floor, or any carpet underneath would also be saturated. The urine is NOT leaking through the seams of the cover / liner, but rather going right through the taffeta liner. Trying to keep the bed free of urine stains and smells was manageable until winter hit, but now I have no way to allow the bed time to dry after cleaning. I fear that I will have to throw the mattress away after only having owned it for 2 months, and replace it with something washable, or something that truly is waterproof. I honestly don't know how this company can make the waterproof claim on this product.",0

"Great pet food container.  It actually fits more than 25 lbs. of dog food; at least 30 lbs.  Once the food gets down to the bottom its hard to scoop out because of the indentions from the wheels, but other than that it works and holds more dog food than is advertised.",1
"We recently volunteered to foster a cat and her litter of four kittens.  The kittens are now six weeks old, so we have five cats using three litter boxes in our spare room.  I had hoped that this litter, as opposed to the bargain brand given to us by the shelter, would help with the odor and make the job of scooping out the litter boxes twice a day a little easier.  It does not.

First, the odor control is not great at all.  While we do keep the room closed up for most of the day, there is a window AC unit that runs 24 hours a day (sometimes with just the fan depending on outside temperature), so the room is not stuffy.  It smells no matter how often we scoop the litter boxes -- and I am 100% certain the cats are using the boxes and not having accidents.  Odor control is no better than when we were using a litter made from recycled newspapers when the kittens were smaller.

The clumping feature for cat urine does not work well.  The clumps stick to the bottom of the litter box, and when we try to scoop them, they crumble into pieces too small to scoop out.

What we have to do now is, scoop the cats' feces in the morning, then change the litter completely in the evening.  It is the only way to keep the odor from being overwhelming.  Even though we have rather a lot of cats at the moment, with three litter boxes being changed twice a day, you'd think the odor control would be a bit better.  The clumping is a failure.  This is no better than a basic clay litter that does not clump.",0

Every once in a while my dog wants to play at night, and I can't see the other balls after I throw them.  He might be able to see the one that glows just fine, but it is hard for me to see.  The fact that he's all black, he and the ball disappear into the night.

Otherwise, these are good balls that he loves to chase.  I usually get them locally, but Wally World has been out of them for 3 weeks in this size (medium) which are large enough that my lab won't swallow them.  They last a long time and are a good value when purchased from Amazon.",1
About half the doses were already leaking out of container.  I don't really have anything else to say about this,0
"I bought these pet stairs for my 9 year old pekeapug.  She is starting to show some age in her knees.  We would put her on the bed or sofa but she has a tendency to jump off sometimes before we can put her down to the floor. She used them right away with a little coaxing the first few times just to let her know they were there. I do with the steps were a little deeper but they work and they are easy to move around and fold up.
I don't think they would work well for larger dogs even if they fall under the weight limit because they would have a hard time trying to control the stride of their feet as they maneuver each step.  Perfect for small dogs and small puppies.  Perfect height for my bed.",1
"Dangerous product! My cat's paw got stuck in the collar when she was scratching at it. I tried to release the collar but the breakaway clasp was VERY hard to open. Took me a long time to get collar undone. Not true breakaway, so scary...my cat could have choked herself. I threw it away instead of returning it. Be forewarned!",0
"These bands are awesome, I have a chubby chihuahua that gets excited and pees when he's indoors. This band helps a lot so he doesn't pee on his bed or our floor.  It has a pocket liner that I put paper towels in for extra absorption. The only thing is make sure you measure your dog, I ordered small and hat to improvise to make it fit for him. But then again he's a chubby little guy. The best thing about these bands is there washable and he doesn't mind wearing them.",1
These bones really do help with my dog's arthritis in her hips.  I can tell a difference in her when we run out of bones.  I highly recommend this product and starting out with their other products which are preventative.,1
Totally useless product an eye dropper would do a better job.,0
It gets the job done in a clumsy kind of way. Its ill fitting and bulky. The straps around the headrest do not stay tight. It does its job to just physically cover the seats. Spend a little more and get a better product. Its worth it.,0
At first glance the product looks fine but has multiple scratches on the product.,0
My standard poodle puppy was on the Natural Balance Limited Ingredients Lamb & Brown Rice canned and dry food. She developed chronic diarrhea. We subjected her to a battery of tests including testing stool for the DNA of parasites and several courses of antibiotics and de-worming to no avail. I have noticed that the NB food has disappeared off the shelves of the local pet store & when I asked have only been told that they were having problems with the formula. I now see online that other dog owners feeding their dog this product have had similar problems.,0
Awesome ramp for dog who has had leg surgery!! Easy to maneuver due to weight and handle.,1
"Not what I thought, very stiff",0
I have a 6/7 pound pomeranian (with lots of hair) and an XS fit snug enough so she can't chew on it (I've already gone through 4 harnesses in a few months) but not too tight that it's uncomfortable!,1
I love this bowl. I have a very active dog and he loves to eat his food really fast. This helps him to slow his pace and make from the expensive organic food that we buy him. The bowl is very cute and doesn't slide on the floor. I see Zeus leave food now and come back for more when he is ready. Before he just ate everything in less than 10 seconds. The only thing that I would like is if the edges were higher. Sometimes the food spills onto the floor. The owner contacted me and told me he would send another bowl if we wanted when they update that feature in the next round. That was very kind to offer. I am sharing this review in return for this item being discounted.,1
"It might be good for a smaller breed, but our Great Pyrenees destroyed this thing with haste. Funny, because it looks like a Great Pyrenees breed in the photo...kinda what clinched the deal for me. Again, for a smaller dog, maybe, but for a really large, obstinate breed, don't buy. Go bigger.",0
"In a pinch it would work, but it is cheap and lacks quality.  Easier to just carry a water bottle and use hand as a cup.",0
Doesn't seem to bother the dog at all. I guess I might depend on the dog?,0
My dog tore it up in about 5 minutes & had to send back for refund.,0
"I have a four month old Olde English Bulldogge, within the first two hours it was almost covered with blood. I looked in my poor puppy's mouth and she was missing a tooth. When I found the tooth, the bottom was very jagged and I remain concerned that some of the tooth roots might still be in her mouth and causing her pain. Maybe it's good for full grown pups, (though I'd say not because the warnings say it's not for dogs with permanent teeth) but do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR PUPPIES UNLESS YOU WANT THEM TO LOSE THEIR TEETH THIS ROUGHLY!",0
best litter!,1
This is a winner for squeak-aholics!,1
"If these things hold up to chewing, they will be the new best cat toy ever!  They are light enough that they fly across the wood floors, but have enough weight that you can throw them.  So far the cat they were intended for loves them, and has been batting them around nonstop.  Good thing they are quiet!

As others said, just remove the ridiculous catnip tube immediately.  I don't know why they thought it was necessary, or how they think it will actually stay in there.",1
This product works great on my dogs digestive tract. It helps keep them regular and avoid problems.,1
can't fit it in the washer to clean - replaced with a washable waterproof pet blanket (a lot more expensive but found it was worth the investment),0
"Liked nothing about it!
The granules sink to the bottom and after a few days the tank was so filthy was scary!
Was informed subsequently that is common with product",0
"The pump is generic and used for other pet fountains which is why, if you've ever had a problem with a pet fountain pump, definitely don't get this. It's probably the same one that gave you problems in the first place. It was ok for a while. My roommate is overly sensitive to sound so the noise it made bothered him but I couldn't really hear it. At it's lowest setting it still flows at a good pace which would be fine except in order to keep the sound levels down you have to keep the water nearly to the brim which is actually what they recommend. If it goes too low, it echoes off the top ceramic piece making it very loud. And if you overfill, the water flows right over the side of the dish. The variation for low sound to overflow is so small that it's ridiculous.

The cat using this dish loves flowing water so the sound doesn't bother her. But she's also a long hair cat which makes keeping this fountain clean impossible. I cleaned it after one week of use and the fur that had stuck to it wouldn't come off. I know I have hard water but that's a bit ridiculous as, for the most part, it remained wet for the entire week. So now there is a ring of fur around the top of the bowl as well as on the top piece. The set up of this item makes cleaning it daily a ridiculous proposition. Too heavy and awkward.

I loved how it looked before the ring of fur became permanent and the cat really likes it but it's driving me nuts. Definitely continuing the search for a decent pet fountain as this does not qualify.",0
"Fresh and clean. There's a big ventilation hole in the bag, so it leaks badly. Put it right into an airtight bag and keep it in the freezer.",1
"They worked for about 2 months.  The shock system died in 1 collar after that.  Then died in the other.  Then vibration died in both.  They were both charged properly.  In the trash, money wasted.",0
Definitely solved the problem of my GSP gulping food.  I hadn't noticed in any reviews that the bowl has small rubber feet which do a good job of keeping it planted. Will get another to keep at my parents when they watch the dog.,1
Love our doggie backpack,1
Good Price.,1
I measured my boxer puppy and all of his measurements fit within the listing for the large. Someone at the factory must have been drunk when sewing the costume we received because the large was way too small for my pup (the hat was wayyyyy too large also). It's a cute costume but there is no way I can squeeze my dog back into it for Halloween.,0
"This is THE BEST dog leash I've ever owned. I've had it almost a year. It is beautiful, soft and looks brand new. It IS real leather. It absorbs a little shock (which is nice). Truly love this leash. If I get another dog, this is the only leash I'll buy again. It looks just like the photos. Job well done to Zabbow.",1
"This litter is very good, and very reasonably priced.  I don't drive any longer so having it delivered to my apartment door is a huge plus.",1
"We are adding a female french bulldog puppy to our family and wanted to have a harness ready for her when I fly out to pick her up at the end of August when she turns 8 weeks old. I didn't have measurements when I ordered an extra small (stupid decision), and when I received it I realized there is no way an extra small would fit over her rapidly growing noggin. This harness has to fit over their heads, so really the neck size is almost irrelevant, and the material is NOT STRETCHY....AT ALL.

I returned the extra small and ordered a small after inquiring with another french bulldog puppy owner who advised her 11 week old frenchie's medium puppia harness was still a bit too large for her puppy.

While awaiting the small vivien harness to be delivered (and as part of my nesting phase) I went ahead and ordered the medium size as well for her to grow into b/c this style is just so darn cute and amazon has great prices.

So I end up receiving the small and the medium on the same day. You would think I'd be covered with these two sizes, but the medium is sure to be way too large for my frenchie at first, and the small is still too small to fit over her noggin. The breeder sent me measurements (per my request) after I had placed these orders a week ago and her skull was already 12 inches (the small vivien harness only has a 10 5/8 inch head opening) and based on photos I've seen she has grown like a weed since then has probably already has a 13 inch head (which is exactly the size of the head opening on the medium vivien harness). You would think the medium will be perfect seeing as her head might barely squeeze through the 13"" opening, but the rest of the harness is sooooo much bigger than the small and too big for a puppy body.

I don't have the x-small anymore to compare it to the small, but from my memory of the x-small they almost look the same size; but there is a HUGE difference between the small and medium. I was going to return the small, but I decided I will just get out my scissors and sewing machine and make some modifications (like add some elastic to the head opening) so her head will fit through and she'll have a nice fitting harness until her little frenchie body fills out the medium. I'm not sure what the large looks like, but I'm sure we'll be in a large before too long due to the nonadjustable/non-stretchy head opening; or we may need to try a different style puppia harness, as I'm not sure if my issue is unique to the vivien and I don't want to have to keep making modifications that will detract from the cuteness of this harness. I hope this helps someone trying to make a decision on sizes. I read many reviews before my purchases, but everyone seems to make reference to the breed or weight of their dogs, rather than the size of their head/necks, so most reviews were unhelpful to me. I will add a photo of the small and medium harness side by side so everyone can see the difference in sizes.",1
Works great on my beagle/shepherd mix with short thick hair.,1
I have a bunch of these dispensers but I like this one because of the rubber opening. It keeps the bags from just unrolling too far and helps seperate each one at the perferation. And I love a good deoderized poop bag!,1

I caustiously continued to use it for about 4-5 more months.

"Best litter box I've ever had.  I was worried about the flap (my cats weren't used to it), but after they figured it out they seem to like it too.  Keeps odors and litter dust in (which is very important in my one bedroom apartment).  Plus it's not an eyesore, so I don't need to hide it.  I normally take the entire lid off when I clean the box instead of using the easy open flip top, but I have a male that sprays and it's easier to get in the corners with the lid entirely off.  Easy to remove and put back on.",1
Plastic turns into sharp points after just a little bit of chewing and made my 3-year old lab/German shepherd mix dog's gums bleed (and he has extremely healthy teeth and gums).  I ended up taking it away from him soon after I gave it to him because I didn't want him to get hurt.  :(,0

Had no results with this product. Started as directed by dosing once a week. After that I tried dosing every 3 days and still no results. I then tried dosing every other day and still had no results. Finally I was dosing every day and this all lasted about a month or so and my nitrate levels never changed. Doing regular water changes helped the most.,0
"I own several different leashes from different brands and the clip from this bag dispenser does not attach to any. The clip is way too small! I recommend Earth's rated, but it only comes in green and is $1 more than this; however Its totally worth it and actually fits on many different leashes",0

I've been giving her one a day for about a month now and was quite pleased with them until tonight when I was lying with her eating one.  The round shape at top was the end she started on and all of the sudden she was jerking her body and pawing at her mouth. My husband and I left to rush her to the emergency room and  I was sure she was going to die in my lap on the way there.  After hitting her back and squeezing her stomach and feeling down her throat, by some miracle the lodged piece passed and my dog started to breath again.  I feel like I've been given a gift, my little Riley is okay but I'll never give her these chews or any like it again.  I have learned my lesson after the most terrifying night of my life.",0

This product has practically eliminated the vomiting and mushy stools one of my cats was experiencing and the vomiting from hairballs one of my other cats was dealing with. Digestive issues are now not a problem for them or for me when I clean these messes up. Everyone seems happy. I alternate this product every other day with Dr. Goodpet Feline Digestive Enzymes and they work together like a charm. Price is right as well and all 4 of my cats approve of the taste. Highly recommend.,1

"This worked perfectly for my dog after he had surgery to remove his spleen from cancer. He absolutely hated the cone so I looked for alternatives and came across this. The only difficulty was figuring out how to get his front legs in the first time, but went smooth after that.

"Barely 5 minutes into my initial session with my goldendoodle with this much anticipated VERY expensive brush, and the handle came off.  I saw another reviewer with the same problem but assumed it was a relatively isolated issue.  After all, these brushes have such great reviews, and are SO expensive, that surely a simple thing like a brush handle would be something the company would pay attention to.  The brush itself I believe would be quite amazing if one had a handle to use it.  Seeing how short the screws are that go into the handle, I imagine this happens quite frequently.  My guy's coat is thick, which is why I opted for one of these ""amazing"" brushes.  Bummer.  Here's hoping gorilla glue or liquid nails will live up to their claims.",0

In our case they lasted anywhere from a day to less than a week.  No thanks.

UPDATE:  Reduced to 1 star.  One of these is stuck on a nail and we can't get it off.  Looks like it resulted in a broken nail that's barely hanging on.  Dog looks to be in pain and will likely result in a trip to the vet.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.",0

"I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'

So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..",0

"The fan is awesome.  I'm using this for an aquarium.  This fan keeps my 2 x 96 watt compact florescent lights from overheating the water.  Without it, the water would rise 5 degrees F.  Just one of these keeps the temp fluctuations to under 1 degree.  Additionally, it's a 3"" fan instead of the more common 4"".  After custom building a hood for my tank, I'm glad it's small enough that I could squeeze it into the space on the back of the aquarium between hood and tank and not have to cut a hole in the side of my nice solid oak hood to install it.  The aquarium is in the living room so noise would be a concern.  A regular hang on back filter would be louder than this fan is.  The dishwasher is louder than it is.  I can only hear the sound of the air being pushed if I listen for it.

One problem, that is remedied with this review, is that it does not come with instructions on how to wire it.  I'm posting the instructions out of frustration in seeing review after review where people have complained about not having instructions-yet not a single soul has posted the instructions after talking about having to hook it up themselves *rolls eyes*

It's no big deal to wire.  Really.  Here's how (**use caution because you're messing with electrical wiring-follow these instructions at your own risk**):

INSTRUCTIONS:

You will need-
1 #6 machine screw less than 3/8"" long
1 Ground connector (if your fan doesn't come with one-mind did)
Basic electrical tool(s) so you can crimp, cut and/or strip wire (there is a cheap tool that perform all three of these functions)
Wire nuts or wire splices (wire nuts are better, in my opinion)
Your own mounting hardware

It's common sense to assemble this without it plugged in.  If that's beyond you, do yourself/your neighbor/everyone on your electrical grid a favor and just purchase a plug and play fan.

The plug has three wires, the fan has two.  The green wire on the plug is the ground (or should be).  Connect the ground connector to the green wire by crimping it onto the wire.  On the fan, you'll see a threaded hole (mine had two).  Put the #6 screw through the ground connector and screw it into the threaded hole for the fan.  The shortest screw I could find was 3/8"" which wasn't short enough.  So I held it with vice grips and trimmed it with a hack saw.  The screw has to come down and hold the ground connector tightly or else you'll have a problem.
The other two wires on the plug are power wires.  Connect one of the plug wires to one of the wires on the fan using your wire splices or wire nuts.  Connect the other plug wire to the other wire on the fan in similar fashion.  You're done.  Plug it in.
If you connected the wrong plug wires to the wrong fan wires, the fan will run backwards (there is a picture on the fan showing which way the air should flow).  If that happens, unplug the fan and just switch the wires.  No big deal.",1
"my 11 month old chocolate lab has destroyed this in less than 30 minutes.  I doubt that this material would ever qualify to be used for a fire hose, maybe it is the rejected material not up to snuff, regardless, avoid buying this for your dog if he is a chewer",0
Works great.  Happy with this purchase.,1

"As my puppy (now 6 mos) has gotten older, I don't think the pads are absorbent enough. I find some wetness on the wee wee pad tray I use. When she was smaller, I started off using Hartz brand and they worked well, but I have not tried them now that she's older. Maybe I would be facing the same issue with Hartz as I am with KAZE.
This last batch of Puppy Pads several had defects, the other 2 packages before this one were fine. They are made in China.",1

"I bought this carrier last year for my 8.5lb cat.  I like that it is top-opening, as it's very easy to get the cat in and out without getting bitten or scratched.

However, the handles are positioned a bit awkwardly; once the cat is inside, the basket swings a bit when you are carrying it.  If the handles were wider-set, it would be more stable.  Perhaps it is because my cat is fairly small, and moves around once inside the carrier?

Overall a pretty nice carrier that gets a LOT of compliments. However, I'm still planning to get a traditional kennel for my other cat, who prefers a side-entry type carrier.",1

"I have a slew of interactive ""keep-em-busy-while-at-work"" dog toys and this is one of the least effective in terms of challenge and play time.

The material is a soft bendable plastic which the dog can easily bend with paws/snout to squeeze out a treat, without ever having to ""unscrew"" the toy! defeats the purpose.

Screw threads difficult to screw on smoothly: if you're trying to stuff with treats and get out of the house quickly, you'll spend precious minutes aligning the threads of the center screw-on portion. waste of time.

The orifice that holds the treats (if you're buying the small size) is very narrow and shallow. This makes it more tough for you to distribute the treats. You have to spend time aligning the treats so they lie in the best way so that the dog will be thoroughly challenged.

Overall, this toy is too easily solved, and wastes a lot of your time when assembling and arranging. Instead i recommend the kong wobbler, biscuit block, iq rolling ball, kong for longer play and challenge.",0
"This sounded like a great idea. I carefully applied a strip to one of my stuffed chairs. It stuck fine. But my clever cat took her nails and pulled a corner off and then with her teeth, she pulled the entire strip off and brought it to me. So it's useless.",0
Was way too small for my sugar glider!,0
"I have a male dachshund that was showing signs of discomfort in one of his ears on 2 occasions. So I ordered the Zymox Otic with the green label as soon as I saw him start scratching his ear and a bit of redness the first time. I followed the instructions and put several drops in his ear canal without cleaning his ear first. Less than a half hour later, his entire ear was so red, a dark red and it felt extremely hot to the touch unlike Ive ever seen before. I almost died when I saw his ear and took him to the vet immediately without an appointment. The vet prescribed drops that worked after the very first dose. Youd think I learned my lesson, but no, I went back for round 2. Since I have 3 dogs, I ended up using the entire bottle of prescription ear drops over time and this time my mini poodle started showing signs of discomfort in one of his ears. I only had this Zymox Otic at home so I gave it another go and I got the same results as the first time when I used it on my Doxie. The entire ear turned bright red and felt extremely hot to the touch. My lil guy even cried out when I put my hand on his ear to feel the temperature. Back to the vet for prescription drops we went and his ear healed. I think I was fair in giving it a 2nd chance, but I won't pursue a 3rd. I don't know why both of my dogs had such a negative reaction to these drops. Ive heard that Zymox works well for many others but I cant recommend using it.",0
"my dog loves the squeak, and they were a good price",1
Popped squeaker in less than 30 seconds...not worth the money,0
"I bought this and with in 3 weeks energy bar stopped working. Had to contact neptune which took almost a week before they called me. Then i was told that they know of a bad circuit card and they would replace the unit, just i would have to wait two weeks for them to get it, and then for them to return in. Out of a controller for 3 weeks. Terrible customer service for a product that says it will control everything.",0
"I have a small dog. I purchased the collar because she's prone to bark at other dogs. Let me make this simple for you. My wife had the collar on getting ready for a walk. The dog started screaming and thrashing around. She was in so much pain that I had a hard time trying to get the collar off. I finally did. IT WAS STILL ON AND SHOCKED MY HAND WITH A STEADY ELECTRIC SHOCK. That poor pup was shaking like a leaf. I finally had to take her to the vet for a shot to calm her down. Your product is a piece of crap.
PLEASE GET THIS COLLAR OFF THE MARKET.
For those of you considering this collar, PLEASE DON'T BUY IT.
The single star is the only way to post my message. They deserve no star at all.",0
I tried to walk my two dogs with this leash.  One is 58 pounds and the other is 42.  It broke the first time I used it.  The build quality is very poor.  Do not trust this leash.,0
You have to clean the filter a lot or water will get dirty,0
good,1
"I just purchased two of these collars and I agree with those who have said do not buy!!! We will be returning them. We have used Martingale collars on several dogs for the past 15 years with no problems. But the design of this particular one is very bad. If you have it on the dog and have a leash attached it works fine. But when it is not on a leash the loop that normally should open up and loosen the collar stays in the same position as when it is on a leash. This appears to be due to the bad design of the metal rings that the loop is supposed to slip through. Based on what I see and the fact that dogs are being killed by these collars, they should immediately be removed from the market, and Amazon MUST take them off of their site. How the company selling these can be named PETSAFE is beyond me. These collars are anything but safe.",0
Great product reasonable price fast shipping,1
I used these bell to potty train my pups. I hang them right by the door. These are great and long enough for my dogs to reach.,1
This toy is actually the size of a large rat.  It was not very fun for our cat.,0
Very nice and comes with a fake fish that actually looks real floating in the water.,1
"The container I received leaked as I walked even until the water bottle was approximately half full.  I checked the top several time to make sure it was properly closed. It was.  Also, my dog will not drink from the bottle.",0
Very disappointed. It only came with the TrizUltra.  The Keto Flsuh was not included.,0
I try to use it with my baby in a bath and although the suction cups stick they don't stay in place and they slide all over. Works fine in a shower situation just not a bath.,0
Spud the hamster is a big fan.  :),1
This deflates within 30 minutes. It doesn't hold the air in it. Cute product but inefficient.,0
He loves his new house. It was super easy to build and it blends in nicely with the furniture in our living room. Quality crate.,1
We have a pit bull and it was way to small,0
Didn't retract fast due to being wider and to heavy for me. The Med size works best for me.,0
"I was so hoping this woud help with the tartar build up - it doesn't do a thing.  Makes the dogs breath smell really bad is all it does. Not sure why, but ever since I've been using it - their breath is horrible.",0
I'm glad I purchased the 6ft leash. It is strong and well made. I like purchasing products that are utilizing materials that need recycling. I love the color. The hardware seems very strong after several uses. It looks and feels as if the leash will stand up to my active Lab. I have used the leash for 3 different walks at least a mile or two each at this writing.,1

"I am NOT good at putting things together as a rule, however I did get this put together by myself. I struggled a few times getting the roof pieces to slide/snap together when suddenly as if by magic boom they were. Feels nice and sturdy once its all together. My dogs will go inside but I need to put some outdoor bedding in it for better traction. They don't like the bare floor. Very nice product for a reasonable cost and not terribly hard to assemble.",1
This is a ridiculous design... The ring to hold the tags is designed to be on the inside so it rubs on the pets neck and has to twist to hang to the outer side of the collar!,0
I have a German Shepherd/ Wolf Hybrid who was properly crate trained but still could not be contained in any crate you could imagine. I started to look at my options & came across this. It's been amazing this far! He cannot escape & I feel like he is more comfortable in this crate. Def worth the extra money!,1
The inflatable horn has the air valve sticking out so much that is imposible to conceal. In the picture the horn looks shinny and perfect. In reality is just a stupid blow up badly cut out super fake toy.,0
"After doing a bit of internet research, I chose these boots because they had a consistent high rating, were reasonably priced, and claimed to be durable. My miniature goldendoodle needed to protect his feet in the cold winter elements of Minnesota. Sidewalks are snowy and salty.  You betcha these boots are easy to put on and they stay on great, but the quality is absolutely terrible. Within 2 uses the bottoms began to peel and breakdown, showing holes starting to form. After the 4th wear, I took the first boot off and sure enough, a hole had formed and his foot was soaked and cold. I found a second hole in another boot. The boots are now useless and I need to look for another pair after only having them a week. I would suggest looking elsewhere if you are considering this purchase.",0
Worked great but broke fast,0
Not a product for Adult cats. Opening very small and a hassle to clean.,0
Works to keep our white dog white.,1
Wonderful product! My babies enjoy this toy so much! Especially the various textures. Excellent for teething!,1
we are amazed at the capacity to absorb water and its size is perfect for our dog.,1
The dogs loved the food!,1

"Got ""Froggy"" for my black lab puppy when he was 2 months old and it's been one of his favorite toys for over a year now! It's one of his top go-to toys for morning play and keep away. It shows signs of wear and tear, but it has held together remarkably well. Lots of other toys have come and gone, but this one remains. We will definitely get another when this Froggy finally goes to that Great Toy Box in the Sky.",1
A perfect cut for our dogs!,1
"Cheap. Half the bubbles didn't work, tried punching holes myself. Epic fail. Waste of money.",0
The product came as seen but was missing the bolts to attach it together.  There was no company name or number on the invoice that came with it. I tried contacting Amazon and got no response regarding the missing parts.  Zip ties had to be used to hold it together.  The crate is sturdy and of good quality for dogs that might try to break out of metal ones but I'm very dissapointed that parts were missing and my attempts to remedy the situation went unresolved.,0
The bags have a pleasant smell. They are thick enough to protect your hands. They are easy to tear off and find the opening. I reorder these every time we run low.,1
Two large dogs. One fence between us. This product won't work unless there is a clear line of empty space between the device and the dog. Returning.,0
"You have to shut the tank off to feed your fish, the food quickly drifts with the current and drops down to the bottom of the tank. The filtration system is not very good , the food will just sit on the bottom of the tank and next thing you know you have dirty, cloudy, smelly water. I saw the tank for sale and thought how beautiful, I did not think before buying, I am disappointed.",0
"This isn't super fancy, typical Suncast plastic material, but it still looks very nice! My dog isn't a biter or anything, so I know it'll hold up. The height is perfect for my smaller German shepherd, she no longer needs to bend down to eat! The bowls are of the large universal size, which is nice if you need to replace them or have extras on-hand.",1
"My number one dog treat, and my pups love them!",1
"Product fits in the backseat nicely.  Seems to be of good quality.  I haven't yet found something my dogs can't destroy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product is bad...  I hope it lasts!",1
This sign was too small for my dog even though it says adjustable she's 10 pounds and it's too small and I don't know about the return policy .,0
"I wanted to like it because it's using great ingredients but neither of my cats ate, not even my no-at-all-pickey eating cat.  I gave the unopened bag away to my co-workers for their kitties but haven't heard back even though they know I have more to give away if they liked....  :(",0
Dog just loves this when add it to her food,1
works fine,1
"I had high hopes for this, but it was just too inadequate for the task. I have two young cats, indoor/outdoor, and by Day 7 the cat box was so saturated the house REEKED. Cat droppings were always on the wrong side of the rake, which left me with smeared crud all over both ends of the catbox. I want something convenient, but also even just a little bit environmentally friendly, and this item is neither of those. I'd have to replace the entire bottom pan and man-made blue crystals about every 4 or 5 days, which would be expensive and just more toxic waste for the dumpster. In addition to de-pooping the mechanisms twice a day. Not a win-win.

(And, as an ""In My Humble Opinion,"" a lot of the posts here talk about ""fake reviews;"" that's probably the new trend with a lot of products and services out there now. Remember all those ""work from home!"" ads? People pay others to manipulate product reviews and approval ratings. So that's just my take on how the world works.)

"Maybe this would be a thing for all crates like this, but my puppy is able to let himself out by punching the zipper. Not exactly fun to come home to a puppy on the loose!

"We've been looking for a good healthy choice for our dogs. When I saw salmon from the kirkland brand cheaper than the Blue Buffalo brand I was excited. Now I know better than to go from a brand for price. When I received this and opened the bag it smelled horrible, but I thought I was just being squeamish due to the salmon. Just in case I looked at the expiration date, but it had not yet passed either. I proceeded to give my 2 curious dogs a bowl. These two dogs are not particular at all about their meals. They even like the Ol Roy and kibble sort of food that is mostly corn  and other crud. Immediately when I set the bowls down they took one whiff and looked up at me like I had set down something completely abhorrent and was trying to torture them. Thier little eyes looked at me so sad. I thought maybe they needed to get used to it. So offered their old brand. Several nights tried to give them a bowl. I even added some gravy on top - they still would not eat it. Ive given up, going to try to return it. Not sure I would even give this away. I have a feeling I could leave this stuff out for the starving coyotes that roam our neighborhood and they would not even eat this.",0

I just got my dogs a couple months ago. They are rescues that were crated for 4 years in the garage and only let out a few times a day. Housebreaking has been disff,1
The chickens love it!!  It is fun to watch them chase it around.  There favorite treat to put inside are meal worms,1
Manly smell! Definitely only recommend if your dog is a male. But smells great and I use it after most walks to freshen up my pup.,1
Looks like I got a used one that someone got paint on.,0
"I used to give my kitties dry food to graze on (grain free) and grain free packets. My almost two year old was getting overweight and vet said I should really just give the wet food and put down dry only if I'm going to be away for the day etc. Well for anyone who exclusively feeds grain free wet, you know that gets expensive. So fancy feast caught my eye and it's a lot of fun to buy because there are so many choices. They love the gravy varieties but the classic salmon they love to. My seven month old kitty was throwing up a lot on the kibble. Vet said just give wet, easier to digest. He throws up an occasional hairball but no more undigested food like he was doing with the kibble now that he only gets wet. I still give the grain free packets but alternate with the fancy feast because even though it's not grain free it looks like a good quality food and is saving me money.",1

"My cat is 11 years old and did not take to this system.  I thought if I added more pellets than what came with the starter kit maybe she would use it (she did use 1 or 2x to urinate) but after following the instructions of leaving the new box by her old box for 2 days then remove old box she wouldn't go to the bathroom I was afraid she would make herself ill or cause an infection so I put her old box back down.  And now have all the pellets that are I can't return so I am trying to sell on some of the apps otherwise will donate to a shelter to give to someone that adopts a kitten that can be started with this program from the beginning.  My friend box the system and her younger cat took to the system but she needed more pellets added than what came with the box as well, unfortunately I wasn't able to sell mine to her as she had already gone out and bought more.",0

Awesome shampoo and it smells amazing!! I use this in between grooming appointments for my Shih Tzu and her coat is shiny and smells great!,1
"Bought these and although aware of the height, found after delivery they weren't tall enough to help our Yorkie get up on the bed and also the steps were not deep enough.  However, because they were from a third-party provider, returning them was ok'd but the cost was on us - and the cost was within just a few dollars of the cost of the stairs.  So we kept them, not worth returning and only getting about $10 back.  Will never use third-party supplier again!",0
Plastic ripped at attachements after about a month of use. The dog did not pull and rip off just going in and out of dog house and flexing.. Not good quality plastic.,0

"This toy was gifted to my dog who absolutely loves it!! She loves to chase, fetch, play tug, swing it around by the rope...  She goes bonkers for it. Some days it is much better than food for training.  I should say that she's not keen on chasing balls, the rope seems to make a big difference.",1

"I have a mini Golden Doodle who has coat that is a wonderful blend between a poodle and a golden retriever. Her coat has a good amount of curl to it but is also very soft and fine. Needless to say with that combination she gets matted easily especially on her ears and in the fur where her legs and her chest or abdomen meet. After a particularly rainy month where I had to dry her off with a towel every time she came in from outdoors she developed some very serious matted tangles. I had been trying to use a slicker brush, but it just wasn't getting the job done and my puppy got irritated with the constant tugging and pokiness of the tines. This tool did an amazing job of working through her copious tangles. My dog didn't seem to mind me combing her with this tool either since the side of the tool that touches her is not sharp and doesn't poke her like the tines of the slicker brush. Just be aware that the tines are sharp on the side that you pull toward yourself enough to cut through the tangles so use caution while detangling.",1
"When I placed this order, I was fully aware that I would receive two Tick Keys in colors I did not choose.  I assumed that I would get two of the colors displayed in the wheel image connected to the product.  However, one of the tick keys I received was BLACK.  It was not displayed in the color wheel as an option and it seems like a ridiculous color to use when trying to remove a black tick.  I wrote to the seller, Happy Dog Place, and they said that ""assorted colors"" was made clear in the description and that I could return the Tick Keys for a 15% restocking fees.  That's not worth it for me, but I won't ever do business with this seller again.",0
"I absolutely LOVE this pet product! I have had dogs all my life, and now have seven small dogs, five of whom battle me something awful in nail trimming. I never bought one of these, thinking it would be far worse. Not with this great little gem! It runs quietly and does the job quickly yet smoothly. I love it. I am thrilled I got this at reduced cost for my review. I would have paid much more for this had I known how great it has worked. Sturdy, 2 AA batteries is all that's required. LOVE IT! 5 stars for sure.",1

I you put your rats' food below on the bottom shelf, they may try and chew though to the food, through the plastic bottom of the cage.

"nice, but not so great for a chewing labrador!  He pretty much destroyed it quickly!",1
"It didn't work for me and now that it's past 30 days I'm stuck with it. It didn't faze the neighbor's two dogs at all - one a boxer type and the other a Jack Russell terrier type.  The vendor said it needs to be in their line of sight (no solid fence barrier) and doesn't work on 10% of the dogs.  Either they have down pointed ears (they don't hear it), or they are too stubborn.
Neither of those conditions were present. I was within 8 feet and pointed the birdhouse directly at the dogs.
I heard a sound when it was supposed to be working and I have high end hearing loss.  The vendor was still convinced it wasn't defective.",0
This bathing suit is absolutely adorable! The top fit me perfectly! Very good deal.,1
Broke a month after I purchased it. Wish they could replace it. The length was great.,0

Just what I was looking for.  The pack slides off a little too easily but I'm sure I could fix that easily if I put my mind to it.,1
This piece looks really good in my tank. My fish love this piece to swim through or hide in more than all my other pieces. Looks amazing but it's a little fragile. Had a couple small pieces broken off during shipping but didn't effect how the piece looks at all.,1
"Both my cat and dog love pure bites. I will often buy the chicken in the dog section for both because it's a much larger bag than the cat section.

However these make the cat throw up. Everytime I give her one she throws it and anything else in her stomach up. Thought the first time was a hairball then the 2nd time figures out was these. Withon 5 min she was vomiting. The dog loves them though.",0

"This works great in the back seat of my car, and is of much higher quality than some of the other dog hammocks that I've used in the past. Install and removal is easy, and takes less than 2 minutes.",1
"I received this item fairly quickly and installed in about 40 minutes.  This includes the time to take out the dog door, replace the flap, and install.
I guess my only gripe is that this is an extra large dog door.  I have a 15 lb. dachshund mix that uses this door.  The original flap should not have broken off with only 15 months of use.  I can't imagine having a 50 lb. dog use this door every day, several times a day, and lasting.  I don't know that I would install this same dog door knowing what I know now.
I would give the flap 5 stars but seeing that it's made the same way as the one that broke, I don't expect this one to last much longer than a year, either.",1
"BEWARE! These rubber Chuckit toys cause depigmentation of the lips and mouth/gums (actually any skin area that comes in contact with the product).

We used this and other chuckit products for about 2 years.  One of our dogs played with this ball almost every day.  In the last few months, all skin in and around her mouth up to the nose has changed color from deep black to light gray brown to pink.  Her twin litter mate, who prefers other toys, doesn't display any discolorations.

This rebounce ball and similar toys may be sturdy or near indestructible, but they apparently cause depigmentation of the lips and any mouth area that comes into contact with the material.

This likely occurs faster if your dog retrieves these toys a lot, or likes to keep them in his mouth to walk with or chew on them.

The depigmentation is caused by the chemicals in the rubber (e.g., p-benzylhydroquinone).  Such chemicals also occur in 'natural' rubber and recycled rubber materials, and cause depigmentation of the skin by inhibiting melanin synthesis.

As far as I know, depigmentation/los of melanin can cause problems such as reduced sun protection and skin cancer.  So, I sincerely suggest to:

Look for alternatives and BEWARE of the health problems rubber (and plastics) can cause for yourself and your pets.

We will use the chuckit bounce balls we have as object 'bumpers' or in ways that do not cause contact expose to living beings.",0
"This product was recommended to us by a good friend. We have used it a couple of months with our two dogs. They recently went to the vet to get their teeth cleaned (as they don't go for tooth brushing very well). I will continue to use this product to see if it will keep the tarter from forming. Currently, the dogs' teeth are very clean (since the visit to the vet), but this will be a good start as a baseline to really gauge if the product works or not. Very easy to use... I do have a question though.... Is it ok to use  a little bit of water when preparing their food plus adding this supplement or does it diminish the effect ? Also to know, the Evora Pet supplement is the same product however a bit less expensive... we have used both.",1
Pad is too small. My pup smells the bullseye then pees on the floor.,0
"Purchased this for my aunt's dog, a Pomeranian-Chihuahua mix, for Christmas in a large size since he's a barrel-chested little guy whose adorable ""look how cute I am"" facial expression doesn't match with his desire to be left alone. From what I heard, it seemed to fit and will hopefully get the message across though I think it made him look even cuter so there's that. The bandanna felt like decent quality fabric and printing, also. Now if they'd just make these in different color options for humans...",1
"Really amazing! I have 2 cats who are brothers. I feed them great food and treats. One  of them eats like a champ, but the other one throws up often after meals. They have both been to the vet recently and are healthy as can be. Quite by chance I saw this online and thought that it something  that might help. Well did it ever! I could not be happier. Since adding this to the food my boy who threw up has not done so in five days. It is pretty miraculous. I could not be happier!",1
Terrible! One board doesnt match with the post. So I cant set up it,0
After I used this product my dog has not have had fleas after being infested in them. I also has greatly reduced shedding. I also like the fact that is a totally natural product if you are concerned with using harmful chemicals. Just use 1 pill per each 10 pounds of your dogs every day.,1
Doesn't work and is very very expensive,0
"This is junk. It shocks my dog when she runs. It doesn't seem to work when she actually barks, but it goes off randomly, making my dog scream in pain.",0
I've been feeding my 2.5 years old tabby this food for more than a year. He loves the flavor and I've gotten repeated compliments on how soft and shiny his coat is.,1
"I never realized there was such a quality difference re: prong collars.  The Herm Sprenger is, by far, the best. (I should not have tried to go cheap on this). The Guardian prongs are flat which prevents a smooth flow on fur. The rubber tips exacerbate this poorly designed collar.",0
The small is not appropriate for small dogs,0
"Some batteries seem to have a full charge and others dont
Real bummer",0
My parrot loves these.,1
My dog was constantly knocking this bowl over and ended up selling it.,0
"Giving this toy 2 stars when it should really receive one, just because the toy is amusing.  The toy lasted about 30 minutes before the squeaker broke. I didn't let my dog chew it , just played catch and release with it at the lake for about 30 minutes. Had another squeaker toy that lasted months, should have bought that one instead. For the price, it should have come with a better quality squeaker. Don't waste your money on this",0
I purchased this for my cousin that has barn/porch cats.  Her cats seemed to realize right away it was for them - and they all piled inside.  She said they seem to love this shelter. I told her to put straw in when winter comes to help keep them warm.,1
My cats go through these pretty regularly and they're reasonably priced!,1
Disappointed- my dog had one of these torn up in less than an hour. Not up to Kong standards,0
This hasn't worked AT ALL. I've bought some before and it worked great. Maybe this was a bad batch?,0
"Works great, quick shipment.",1
I just tried to use on my dogs but it won't work.  The battery doesn't fit in the space correctly so you can't use it .  I was able to get it started one time and that was after about 6 times trying to get the battery to fit.  It was a wast of my money and i am very disappointed.  Of course I have thrown away the packaging so I can't ever return it.,0
too big for cat..doesn't fit on collar,0
"Fall off easily, too small for a giant dog",0
These things are amazing! I would give it 10 stars if I could.  My bulldog was shedding everywhere and he smelled really bad.  After a couple of weeks he barley sheds anymore.  His coat is amazing and best of all he doesn't stink anymore.,1
"Very happy with these tags. I've ordered so many tags that have bent and had the engraving wear away over time, but these are deeply etched and very sturdy. High quality - you can't go wrong with them!",1
"I really like this litter scoop.  I had been using for years the DuraScoop (which is also metal with a non-stick coating) and I like it but found it to be a big too heavy and large.  I saw this scoop advertised and ordered it.  I really like it because it gets into the corners of the letterbox and it's not clumsy or too heavy.  I liked it so much I ordered another for a box I keep in another location (have 3 cats).  My only concern is that a purchaser showed that his iPrimio Shovel handle broke away from the scoop.  I hope that does not happen as I really like this and, as one knows, litter is a bit heavy and you need a strong handle/scoop to do the job.  So far, so good, though.",1
Half the plant was bronwed (dead). Rubber band from bag was off so most of the water from bag fell out.,0
"Prescribed by vet for stomach trouble, cheaper thru Amazon, dog loves it sprinkled on his food.  Can't tell if it has helped his stomach  as rarely has diarrhea but has been diagnosed with IBD thru biopsy.",1
"Package was opened.  It was not an accident, but a corner was clearly, cleanly cut and wasn't resealed. The bag was a little light, too.  Beware you may get a used/ returned or opened product.",0
Way larger even after I measured my dog. So I had to reorder another brand. Gave big one to a friend.,0
as shown in the photos,1
Did not work for my 8 pound Shihpoo. He was still scratching constantly.,0
"Totally bummed.  It is advertised as fitting a chinchilla, but NO WAY!!! Too small for rats and chinchillas!  Totally worthless.",0
Wonderful,1
cute and fast delivery,1
"Bought this to curb my dog since he wolfs down his food like he's starving. It says it will stick to any bowl, but after several tries, it wouldn't stay in either the stainless steel, not the plastic bowl. I tried to return it, but they do not offer free returns, and the shipping cost was almost what I paid for it. Would not recommend.",0
Its the perfect size!,1
"My dog HATES this brush, and I can understand why. The bristles do not have a pleasant feeling, a little scratchy. It barely removes any hair. I like that the bristles tuck back in, but that's really about it. I would not recommend this product.",0
"I ordered the large size (24""), it came well packed and with instructions. I assembled the cat window perch in less than 10 minutes, there really was not much to it.
What I was most worried about based on other reviews, is that it wouldn't fit for our almost 30 year wooden windows. Well, it fits perfectly!!!
And boy, is this perch sturdy.... when the window is open and when the window is closed.

I highly recommend this product, you get what you pay for and this one is worth every penny. It's a one time investment.
I will definitely order another one for another room.",1
"Soon as it came out of the package he went right for it.
He Loves it.",1
This smells great and has been very gentle on my sensitive Shih Tzu.,1
Great quality.  Great price.  This coupler will last a lifetime.  Very satisfied.  Quick shipping too.  Thank you.,1
Extremely pleased with how it cleans. I was able to do my entire home (3 bedrooms) and all with one 48oz cleaner.,1
This product worked great on my dog!  My dog had fleas.  I purchased and applied the Frontline on my dog.  Within 30 mins - my dog stopped scratching.  I'm happy with this product.,1
While this crate has served its purpose it did arrive slightly damaged. Some of the latches don't line up correctly due to this and makes it difficult to lock to doors.,0
I have been using this product gor years and none of my dogs suffered ill effects.,1
One pump stopped working one month after purchase,0
Henry loves them!,1
"I used to have a Tetra Whisper HOB filter but then I switched over to this. The motor is a little quieter than the Whisper and I love that this one is customizable. My only cons are have you have to prime the filter after each water change and  that if I change the flow to the lowest setting, the motor will make some noise (a little louder than the tetra whisper)",1
This is a great product just need to make sure that it fits your dog I had to get an extra large for my boxer he weighs about 75 lb and has a white chest which is difficult to find jackets for him that fit.,1
"I got the correct paw size for my lab, but these wouldn't stay on.  The velcro doesn't tighten up enough and she shook them off.  Had to return them.",0
"I just sent an email to Purina about this litter. I am using it as the bulk of my review.

""I recently got 2 large bags of  Tidy Cat Pure Nature cat litter. I chose it because of the scent, the lightness, the dust-free statement, and because it is natural. Well, I got the scent, the lightness, and the natural. What I didn't get was the dust-free. I just scooped out my litter box, went to wash my hands and discovered that washing my hands just wasn't enough, I needed a full shower! I was literally covered in dust: my hands, arms, face, hair, and front of my blouse were white with dust. I have used litter boxes for my cats for more than 20 years and have NEVER had a cat litter as dusty as this litter. I would like to know how you determined that this litter was 99.9% dust-free? As I said at the beginning I bought 2 large bags, I will be returning the 2nd bag to the store as soon as possible, just wish I could get my money back on the first bag. I will NOT be recommending this litter to anyone, if I say anything to anyone about this litter it will be ""Do NOT buy this litter, it's terrible for both you and your cat(s)!"" Considering the long-standing reputation of Purina products I am totally surprised, and dismayed, that you would even offer this litter to the public.""

What I didn't include in my letter was the fact that, while this litter tries to clump, it just doesn't clump strong enough to scoop it out intact, much much worse than other clumping litters I've tried over many years. The scent is strong, enough to make my eyes water but I can deal with that since my son isn't complaining about the smell of the last litter we used.

Even though I really liked the weight, a scent I can live with, and the natural factor, the problem with the dust is a such a huge issue, I can only give it one star.

UPDATE: I did receive a response to my letter to Purina.  The company expressed concern about the dust issue, asked me to send them some of the litter I had (they paid for packaging and postage) and sent 3 coupons towards future purchases on any of their litter products. I did as requested and sent the sample of the litter. As of this date, August 22, I have heard nothing more from them nor do I expect to.",0
"I clicked a different size but when I ordered it, somehow the size changed. ):",0
I am so glad that the filters are individually wrapped inside the box.  My cats love their cat mate fountain.  Easy to clean and change out filters.,1
"The sweater was not the same one in the picture, at all. The print was different and it came with a hood. We live in a cold region and our puppy needed something for a winter storm we were dealing with, otherwise I would have sent it back",0
Best price for this package of filters around! Definitely my go-to!,1
"So it was great the first couple of days, then my kitty figured out how to unscrew the cap off the top.",0
I wasn't sure if this would help keep the litter in the box but it certainly does. My cats had no trouble getting used to the higher walls.,1
Holly likes here new bed.  She said it is comfortable & is also pleased that there are 2 sides--one for summer & one for winter..,1
You gotts be kidding. I put one of these and puppy around it. I put three of them down and the puppy pooped everywhere except on the pad. I put five of these down and the same thing happened. If I were to cover the whole room the puppy would become constipated.,0
Horrible product! Lumpy and poorly designed. I sent it back.,0
excelente,1
Cats love it,1
"Our 70 lb, 11 month old Boxer has chewed on his new Hurley bone every day for over a month. So far it only shows a couple of small chew marks. This is unreal when you consider how fast he has chewed through other toys we've tried. We are sold! We will without doubt buy other Hurley toys in the future.

To add to my first review; after 7 months of continual chewing his first Hurley, our Boxer only made a few deep chew marks. That is much, much better than any other toy we purchased for him. We did not want him to work pieces loose, so we ordered him a new Hurley and tossed the original.

The new Hurley is noticeably lighter weight than the first. Our Boxer has now chewed on the new toy for 2 weeks, and it shows no signs so it must be as tough as the first. We are impressed enough with the performance of these toys that we've shared the information about them with our dog-loving friends.",1
My cockatoo is a picky eater and she loves this product.  Very healthy and balanced diet.,1
Did not work.,0
My cats love this. They ruined one after 2 years or use and love their new replacement even more. I put it  near my couch so they scratch the post instead of the couch. Such a lifesaver.,1
Really good quality. I just wish that they were available in a smaller size.,1
"Adorable little dress for my mini Aussie at Christmas.  Cute Cute Cute!  Runs a little small, but luckily I had ordered up a size.  15 lbs - size large.  She looked so cute in her pictures.",1
We use this scoop everyday to help measure out our dog's food. The lines are intuitive and make it easy and consistent. Very sturdy plastic material. Would highly recommend this scooper for the pupper,1
"I bought this product after losing the one I used to have for my dog. Initially I bought the first one from Walmart (worked perfectly, I've never seen my dog so well behaved) and I checked 3 local Walmart's to find that exact one again but no luck. So, instead I searched amazon and decided to buy this one which is absolutely awful. It doesn't work. I tested it several times and the test say it's working. Never actually works when my dog is wearing it. Doesn't even work as a scare tactic anymore. Also, this product is obnoxiously big. My Shiba Inu is 25 pounds and this collar is half the size of her head. Really wish I could find that old collar from walmart. They don't even have it online. GOES OFF WITH MOVEMENT. My dog was petrified from moving because the collar was going off for no reason. The beep would sound so you know that's the reason.",0
"does not amount to a hill of beans, pull the string and it moves for about a second, my cat pays no attention to it and I don't blame him, cost too much and does nothing worth talking about would not purchase again.",0
My dog would not eat them...they smell very bed!,0
My fat cat just ended up eating more of the dog's food. This cat food is like sawdust and crumbles everywhere.,0
Solid construction and heavy duty material provides excellent protection for the rear seat of our Dodge Ram pickup.  Installs easily and resists stains.  A must-have for the well-travelled pet!,1
Doesn't remove the smell. I've used this multiple times for puppy accidents. Terrible for cat urine. Only removes part of the smell for dog urine. I've moved on to a much better product.,0
My dog shredded it in about 2 weeks. Compared to his old one that lasted 2 years.,0
great product,1
My dogs love this mat. It is a cool soft relief in hot Arizona summers:) It is great for long and short haired dogs-you will love it too because you know you are doing something nice for them.,1
"No complaints from my dogs, but they are not picky.
High quality ingredients.",1
"It is very colorful, and durable.  This has turned into her favorite toy!  Due to the fact that it is very well made, I expect this to last many years!",1
My small cat used these and her urine soaked right through.  Don't waste your money.,0
Great Product and super fast delivery.,1
"The perfect dog bed, I have bought two.",1
Did not hold up very well to a power chewer. Might hold up to a dog that chews less/softer. Otherwise it seemed like a decent product.,0
"While there is nothing technically ""wrong"" with the bells, I followed instructions and they don't seem to work with my dog.  BTW, if you have a ""lever"" type of doorknob, these will not stay put.

It's almost january1st and after two weeks of taking our dog to the bells, pawing at them with her paw in our hand, and rewarding with a treat...NOTHING!  I really want these to work!",0
Great product,1
"Stopped my cats vomiting.  My 7 yo rescue cat has always had periodic vomiting.  I tried special cats foods for sensitive stomachs and grain free.  No change.  He came down with gastritis and the Vet gave me this for him.  He stopped vomiting.  Once his treatment was over and I stopped giving him the Fortiflora, he started vomiting again.  Restarted the Fortiflora and he quit until I again stopped giving him this supplement.  Now I give him Flortiflora every day and as long as he gets it, he doesn't vomit.  Also, I don't give him the whole package.  He refused his food with this much mixed in.  I sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon once a day with his canned cat food.  I have two other cats, also rescue, who also occasionally vomit, but not as often.  They have also stopped vomiting.  The packets last a lot longer by giving a smaller amount.  My guess is that the mfg wants you to use the product faster so that you will order more sooner?  Anyway, a small amount works for my cats and well worth the money if you don't like cat barf.",1
They just don't fit!,0
Adorable. Well made . Good service. True sizing!,1
My dogs love peanut butter. This has no scent. My dogs ignore it.,0
This made it one car trip with a seventh month old dog before it broke. The material tore so easily where it latches.,0
Inaccurate. Flimsy. Suction cup doesn't even work. They do however provide a second battery if you'd like the POS to work for longer!,0
"This stuff really helps.  I had a problem with my latest rescue kitty being insecure.  Over the years, I have had several rescue that had health problems which required them to be indoor all the time and they made mistakes.",1
Too small.  Very poor value.,0
"love the box it comes in my cat always finds it and pulls feathers off, but the handy box saves it !! I will buy from this seller all the time now",1
"Gave these to a friend who has adopted several free roaming cats.
She says they all Loved the treats and mewed for more.....",1
"My Peach and White Teddy Bear Syrian Hamster named Rex, simply loves these. They last a very long time, whereas I only  give him one half of one a day. And since I have been giving him these, he comes to me more and trusts me more. These and walnuts are his go to treats. I bought the three packs this time, because they are a better deal, and with my prime membership they had no S&H, but the single pack was an add on, and would have cost me S&H unless I spent a lot more. I love my prime membership ...",1
Not much more to say.  They love these and never get bored with them.  We'll continue to purchase.,1
"Have purchased this food for my pembrokes for the past several years...The pembrokes and myself really liked the food. The food purchased this time was delivered with 1/2 the contents CRUSHED and food littered with BURNT pieces. I use this food in a treat training machine, plugs due to fine particles even after using a kitchen sieve to sift out crushed kibble(worked with past purchases)  My daughter(Certified Dog Trainer)also experienced the same poor quality in her last shipment, a friend also orders this food for her giant schnauzer again the same situation.  I can't use water with the food due to the fact that it sets up like concrete.  I would appreciate an explanation from the manufacturer. Unfortunately this excellent food will not have continued market success with product such as myself, daughter, and friend received. I will not reorder this dog food nor tell anyone to purchase the food until manufacturer produces a quality product.",0
We were sure this stand would hold our 150 gallon aquarium but it would not.  Much smaller than we thought.  Returned it.,0
It fits and keeps my puppy warm.,1
After a lot of trouble with businesses my son was beside himself concerning his service dog in training.  These helped a lot.  They at least give him more security concerning his rights.,1
My cats adore these. They're especially good for my old boy with bad teeth who has a hard time chewing crunchy treats.,1
"Bought this muzzle because my dog keels killing out free range chickens. This muzzle keeps the nose exposed which you would think is good but if your dog isn't in love with it they will try to get it off. My dog was bleeding all over the place. Eventually had to remove it because our dog opened up nose wound every time.

Was able to bark ans drink, just needs nose protection.",0
Works perfectly I don't lash my dogs anymore,1
"The very best distance I could get with this thing was 41 1/2 feet, and that only when I used a different ball from what they provide: AND I haven't been able to replicate that, so would have to call it a fluke. The balls provided have a gummy rubber trim around them (kinda dumb, if you were to ask me). The ball I used had no gummy trim, so was less sticky. It is extremely loud and my dog is a bit afraid of it. I think she would overcome that, but with an average range around 22' on the thing and the significant difficulty of pulling back the spring to fire each time (put my neck & shoulder in painful spasm after about 5-8 shots), this thing is pretty much worthless and not much fun. Considering that a major reason for buying it would be a desire to play fetch with your dog despite shoulder, neck, and or arm problems; it defeats a major purpose in using it with it's difficulty and amount of strength it takes to cock it. Their claim on the box of 75' is absurd. I returned this poorly designed waste of plastic (Won Lane was awesome about the return process). I then bought the Nerf Dog Tennis Ball Launcher which is much, much easier to cock and consistently launches the ball around 32'. see less

UPDATE:  I said above, very soon after purchasing this item and seeking a refund, that Won Lane was ""awesome"". I have to revise that, because, though they refunded my money without making me return the K-9 POS, they later called me repeatedly and pressured and pressured me to give the K-9 a good review though I hated the thing and repeatedly and firmly told them I would not lie to help them ""launch this product"". They wouldn't stop and I finally had to hang up on them. So, beware, some of the reviews may not be that reliable.",0
too small,0
"Great for wet food, not so much for dry.",1
"The large shown is about a medium sized. My dog hangs half off and is just a large breed.
Also goes flat fast and doesn't have much ""cushion"".
Not happy with the purchase.",0
"A little disappointed. Kong product showed many teeth marks after a short amount of playtime, first use. In addition, the spherical treat dispenser no longer rotates freely. (Guess our dog is a ""vigorous"" chewer.)
Great idea, though perhaps better suited for a ""moderate chewer"" type dog. Good size for 50pound dog.",0
AWSOME,1
It broke in two weeks.  I don't think this was a genuine Gentle Leader.  You can't return it either!!! I would have given it 0 stars if I could.,0
"I bought a few different toys to try out because I use these to feed my cats their dry food and this is the one I liked the least. I feel like there are other toys at the same price that are better.

Pros: it's easy to fill, easy to clean. could be better with a more challenging treat like a big piece of cooked chicken.

Cons: It's too easy for the cats. the hole is too big for dry food. It feels flimsier than other toys like it.",0
this product is garbage and i will NEVER use it again. i now have to wait 3 weeks before applying advantage to my dog to get rid of the fleas and flea eggs. i did bathe her but unfortunately i had waited 5 days after i applied this. i do not reccomend this treatment for dogs or cats it does not work. don't waste your money.,0
"Very easy to use, works great.",1
"Complete waste of money. 0 stars if possible. My 5 MONTH old setter puppy nearly escaped on the side of the road when she jerked and the ring ripped right through the nylon and came off! Crappy stitch job. Super unsafe and a rip off, literally.",0
"Yes, love it.",1
I have an anxious dog and this product did not help.,0
"We have used this size gate for years with great success.  It keeps our Pomeranian out of the laundry room where we keep the litter pan.  The cats jump over it like it's not even there and we easily step over it. After a while you get so used to it I think we'd probably still do a high-step maneuver going into the laundry room even if it wasn't there. Besides, high-stepping is good exercise. In fact we are so used to it that we took it with us on vacation to keep our little dog from going downstairs and completely forgot it when we packed up to leave. It was right in front of us as we were packing yet we didn't see it so we had to buy another.",1
"When buying a lab puppy I had no idea the amount of hair and slober he would leave behind on the furniture. The vacuum wasn't enough and spot cleaning with a wipe wasn't fully removing the slober stains. This product is very helpful in doing both. You MUST put a little work in to see results. From the pictures attached you can see how the tool grabs the hair and balls it together, making it easy to vacuum up. Also, you can see how it pulls and draws out slober marks from the pillows. Very helpful tool, I recommend anyone with animals should have one. :)",1
Thin but good for temporary  bed,1
I got this for my dog during the summer going into fall.  My dog continued to be infested with fleas. I would not recommend this product for pet owners who walk their dogs close to water ways.,0
My 10 pound yorkie-poo broke this one in no time. The red loop came completely out of the clamp.,0
Seems to leave a fish tank odor to the water.,0
"I have bought several of these collars, and for the most part, they work very well for the price (less than $4).  I also have the Nite Ize and the AKC version of this collar, and I wouldn't say they were that much better and they were at least 3-4 times the price, if not more.  Unfortunately, though, this collar (and the other brands as well) doesn't work especially well for small dogs because their small size is are probably what most companies would consider a medium, and it is impossible to adjust the collar small enough for a 10-lb. dog.  However, I don't consider that a huge issue since I just put the collar over my dogs' heads to wear over their primary collar when we walk at night (I have black dogs).  I have had one dog lose a collar by it slipping off of his neck during our walk (when he was no doubt sniffing something interesting), and on the last batch of collars, the electronic gadget that powers the light for the collar was apparently not affixed to it and fell out during the walk, rendering the collar useless.  I'm waiting to hear about returning the collar as I type this.  Even with these issues, though, I will continue to buy them as they are cheap and do the job I need them for.  Just know that you are not buying a high quality item that will last you years and years.",1
Has survived quite well.,1
It was delivered on time. The cost is much cheaper then the vet. The product works wonders for my dog.,1
Love these harnesses,1
"We bought this as a replacement for an existing puppia harness, but we had to return ours as the quality of the stitching was much poorer and the sizing was off. I am not sure if the harnesses quality went down since we bought the first one or if the ones online differ from what you can get in the store.",0
Got this for my lab had to put paper towel in the hat for it to stay up and it lasted a whole three seconds for a picture before she took it off but it was worth it,1
"This works wonders. I get easily grossed out by bugs and don't like to touch them. This removed all of the ticks easily off my kids, my parents when they came to visit, and my dog.",1
"My pitbull had a lot of fun tearing this toy apart in less then a day.... I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet to have it replaced, hope their service is good.",0

"Rejected by 16, 5, and 3 year old cats.",0
"Kittys loved it first night, now its in the way lol",1
dogs liked them,1
The design seemed nice but the front buckle strap broke extremely easily the FIRST time I used it.,0
"This stuff is awful. I bought this last year in a desperate attempt to get cat urine out of a couch of ours. The reviewers that say it smells gross are right. This stuff resembles cucumber/cotton candy and butt. It literally does not get out the urine smell but instead ""covers"" it with cucumber smell...leaving you with a sweet cucumber cat pee odor. It's awful, just awful. The positive reviews have to be faked.",0
Product arrived somewhat damaged. One of the four pins was pushed in. Appears to work although I am not sure for how long.,0
broke immediately,0
"Wipes work well, but the listing is bogus. The picture shows a container of 100 wipes, but sadly you will only receive a sample-sized plastic envelope of 28. Will not purchase again.",0
This should not even be sold for large dogs.,0
It stopped her from pulling me but ripped her nose open. .,0
Product disceiption is very misleading! Unless you want a smelling house/room you have to clean the litter box everyday! When we bought it we thought yay! An extra day not cleaning the box so 3 days in total we could only go 1 day so annoyed! Be careful what you buy could of saved money and bought a regular litter box instead of this misleading product,0
"My dog was just starting to show signs of hip problems when we started him on this product.  After about 3 weeks, he is back to his normal active self.  We will be giving him Synovial for the rest of his life.",1
Have been using it for 2 weeks now and the algea is not green anymore.  Seems to be of good quality.,1
It's a nylabone...the dogs love it.  It's standing up to my pitbull and border collie.,1
The piece that attaches to the cage is very large and will not work with my rabbit's hutch. I can't use it.,0
Do NOT buy if your dog likes to chew they will fall apart quickly!,0
Good concept but my turtles didn't mess with it at all. I wasted my money.,0
This is my second purchase of these. Every year I take an extended vacation and I have a 75 gallon fresh-water tank. The tank is made of up small to large Cichlids and I had zero issues when I returned last time. I was surprised to see that there was still half of each left when I returned (They ate half) and I dropped in 4 or 5 as I recall... for about 15 Cichlids.,1
My black lab puppy broke the leash loop off the collar within 5 minutes. Not worth it!,0

"I'm pretty good at putting things together but anyone should have no problem putting it together.  It took me about 45 minutes to get it ready.

We have a big cat and he can use everything, the ""house"" part is only big enough for about half his body and he doesn't use the net area, but he might if I added longer rope to the attachment points.

Its sturdy and there is no way it could fall over even when he is ricocheting off of it.  The upper level will wiggle a little but he likes the sketchiness I think cause he always goes up there heavy footed.

Overall great product at a very good price.",1
The non adjustable neck didn't work for our Yorkie. XSmall was a touch too small and she's 4 lbs. Seems well made but fit might be tricky.,0
I now buy this product on Amazon with subscribe and save as I save about a dollar a can from the supermarket and this is the only food my wife will feed the dogs. They are small shih tzus.,1
"Poor quality, but you get what you paid for.

It worked fine as long as it worked.  After a few weeks the collar and remote stopped sycn'ing.  I tried new batteries etc and nothing worked.  Item returned.,0
"I had a sweet puppy that would only sleep with her giraffe. I had to find it each night and she would sleep with it. In the morning she would cry until you got it off the bed for her. Then she would hide it under a pillow until she was ready for another snooze with her baby. My puppy passed away at 9 months and my heart is still broken a year later. When. The anniversary of her death came, I had to buy another ""baby"" to keep with me forever. I have 2 dogs now and they absolutely love these toys. It's so cute to see them running with these in their mouth like they caught the animal themselves. They love the squeaker and no stuffing!! Perfect little toys for your fur babies and maybe a special baby for a puppy. Enjoy!",1
Every time I used it there was a lake in my kitchen,0
It did not meet my expectations at all.,0
"After only 4 months, the unit stopped working.  The plug into the wall AC to DC converter is very hot, and the pump no longer works.",0
Too small to give to my cats. I threw them away.,0
Our horse has shown some improvement after using this product.,1
The dog travel hammock worked great for my dog on a recent long trip. It is soft and sturdy and fit great in my Volkswagen. It was easy to attach and unhook.,1
"This review is for the Flipper Nano size. It's pretty good compared against a MagFloat. I guess I'm slightly disappointed in the razors strength. It needs to be at a slightly steeper angle and that would likely give it more umph. It certainly scrapes coralline off better than the mag float (magfloat barely touches it), but you really have to work at it. If you've got a dime-sized circle of coralline on your glass, expect a dozen passes before it's gone. And then there's that occasional spot that too much for it. No matter how many passes you make, it's not completely going away. The razor just doesn't have the strength. But yet, I know for a fact a handheld single-edged razorblade can take it off with one pass. So that speaks volumes. This just doesn't have the scraping power I thought it would. Note to the creator if you're reading this: I think if you made the small rubber bumps opposite the blade a little larger, that would give the whole tool a slightly steeper angle and maybe more power?

The magnet strength on the nano version is sufficient, but just about maxed out. It holds very well, but the two sides don't ""suck together"" with the force you'd expect. I would say the 1/4"" glass spec they list is accurate. So if your glass is thicker than 1/4"" (yes, even 3/8""), don't get the nano version. Note #2 to the creator: Maybe if the magnets were stronger the blade would have more power bulldozing across the coralline? I mean, aquarium glass doesn't get much thinner than 1/4"" and these magnets are about maxed out for a design/use like this.

One sure positive it has is it's low profile. I bought the Flipper Nano and was previously using the MagFloat Nano. It's lower profile than the MagFloat. This means it has no problems squeezing by rocks that might be close to the side glass. Overall it is wider and taller than the MagFloat nano, for those wondering.

Overall, neat design and better than many on the market, so 4 stars.

EDIT: After owning it about 2 months, the magnet inside the ""handle"" portion of the Flipper has come loose/unglued. Everything still works, but as you're sliding the flipper across the glass the magnet inside the handle jitters and makes noise. Kind of annoying.",1

"I have a toy fox terrier, these balls don't last a day with her. I like the size but not worth the price. I bought regular tennis balls at wal-mart for much less and she still has them. Yes these are smaller but she like the regular size balls just as much if not more, and they last longer.",0
"Nice and big for our boxer, but she has been able to bend the bars apart with her nose. She cannot escape the kennel, but we don't use it as we are afraid she will hurt herself or get her face stuck since the bars are so easily manipulated.",0
"Too small for any kind of fish! Even a betta needs a 2.5 gallon at least. Try somewhere else, even a small $20 3 gallon starter kit from Petsmart will work better than this. With this small amount of water the fish will not only not have enough space to swim, but the ammonia levels will rise too quickly and hurt the fish. You'd have to change the water every single day to keep ammonia low. And there's no way to set up a nitrogen cycle in the tank with no filtration media. Please research before buying a tank like this or a fish!",0
One of the best toys for my dogs who are strong chewers. This is the second one Ive purchased and either my dogs are sharing with the other dogs in the neighborhood or they are buring it. I can't find them!! Will buy another one.,1

I can't rate five stars and I can't rate it bad either as I have not used them yet. I just got them in the mail about twenty minutes ago. I chose the arm and hammer puppy pads because I have severely sensitive skin and arm and hammer products are usually the only products I can be around. When I opened up the package I immediately started to itch and get small bumps on my lower lip. Not big red noticeable bumps but the small red rash like bumps. The fact that I had that reaction makes me weary on using it on my puppy. I'm not sure if I'll continue to try and use them but if I do I will update this review. :),1
Great price,1

"I am so glad I bought this cage! I sometimes foster cats and this is perfect for the temporary quarantine of new fosters or for housing litters. It is also useful when you are trying to acclimate a new cat to other kitties. It can be assembled by one person. The assembly is moderately challenging, but it is a big cage after all. The directions are very easy to understand. I would definitely buy a second one if I need it.",1

Pretty much a giant pillow. Material was too soft and comforting. Not enough cushion to support my dog.  The few times he climbed on it he seemed to not be able to get comfortable,0
"Took about a week and a half for my 3 month old German Shepherd puppy to learn how to use the bells. Now he alerts us when he needs to go outside to go potty or to play. All we needed to do was take his paw and hit the bells before going outside each time for him to learn. The only negative is that our bengal cat thinks he can go outside if he also rings the bells, silly kitty.",1
I ordered this DVD for my 87 year old mother who is having trouble with her minature pincher biting.  Mom said the video is boring and has bizarre suggestions--like putting your hand in the dog's mouth.  Disappointing based on what was written up.,0

Any other toy she's had (cloth/stuffed chew toys or alternative bone chew toys) she has demolished within minutes, so she can definitely do some damage quickly and this toy stands up to that. Kong toys seem to be the most durable for her teeth.",1

"While the piece I received is, in fact, 6 inches (if you roll it along a ruler - it is curved), it is only about 3/4"" in diameter at one end and tapers to about 3/8"" at the other end.  Not at all the big, evenly sized chunk pictured (and yes, I know it's antler so each piece will be unique - the one I received was especially small and tapered).  My 50 pound dog will destroy this in a few weeks - but I will have to take it away from her sooner as it will quickly become a choking hazard (I will probably give it to my friend's 24 pound dog).  I have purchased other elk antler pieces (from dog shows) that were bigger and cost less.  Not a good value.  From now on I will stock up at dog shows.",0

"Comparative review of Petttom Cat Dog Pet Carrier vs Becko Mesh Pup Pack Soft-sided Outdoor Travel Backpack Pet Carrier (Large)

Quality: Petttom>Becko
Design: Becko>Petttom
Major problem: Both the bags collapse even if you are wearing them on the shoulders. They don't have pipping on the sides. Very uncomfortable for the pet. One has to hold the top of the bag to make sure the cat/puppy is comfortable, which while you are traveling is uncomfortable for you.

I like the idea of carrying the pet in a backpack BUT not at the cost of pet's comfort. Both these bags have absolutely no hold, they collapse and all that space inside the bag thus makes no sense. I travelled from India to US with my cat. She was in a custom made standard design pet carrier. It was very difficult to carry her around. She was approx 12 pounds then. I ordered this bag for my 4 months old kitten. I thought that the backpack would make it easier for me to carry my cat around the airport but I guess I will have to carry two tote style carriers. Otherwise my kitten would be hitting the walls of this bag as I walk swiftly at the airport. Constantly monitoring the hold of the bag will be impossible and stressing him before he is on the plane is definitely not a good idea.

Buy neither!",0
My dog loves this ball...carries it around with him all the time....is good size for him as he is a big rottweiler,1
"I have big goldfish and the other pellets I bought were too small (API Goldfish sinking pellets). API is full of great ingredients but I wanted them to munch on something a little bigger. So I bought them the Omega One and they are so happy and satisfied!!! Omega One also has great ingredients so that's more of a plus. It makes me happy. I only put four stars because not all of them sink (2 out of 6), but I really don't care about that. I will be buying this one again. :)",1

I was so excited to get this for my dog because he is a bit energetic and unruly. I thought it would help me train him. I used 6 6volt batteries in a week. This collar is terrible it doesn't work. I should have researched this product a little more before I purchased it. Don't waste your money.,0
Well made and great product. It was guick to arrive and so comfortable for my little puppy. The expandable carrier idea is fantastic. Why didn't I think of it?! Definitely would recommend it.,1
Smells really good and the smells lastest for a long time. I have a wild coat jack Russell and his coat looks and feels silky after I apply the conditioner.,1
"This is a DO NOT BUY!

The good side: Tank looks fantastic! Much better than the traditional configuration.

The bad side:
1) Filter is beyond inadequate. Low volume after a few days of operation. Not easy to remove and clean with power cord in enclosure in back. Hard to find replacement that will fit into the small opening in the top. Have an alternate in place at the moment. Solution is an external filter.
2) Lighting is also beyond inadequate. Mid-level light plants were not thriving. Lots of aftermarket light kits to compensate, but at this price, why didn't the included lights meet the basic needs of aquarium plants?",0
"Great natural alternative to calm my hyper boxer/beagle pup of two years.  He gets one every evening so that he can easily be ready for bed when the rest of the pack is.

"This is the best leash I've ever purchased, and as a long-time rescuer, I've purchased a lot.  My husband and I gravitate towards large dogs, and we both have issues with our hands, so I found the bungee-type leashes work best for our purposes.  The previous one we had for years was a little too short, but served it's purpose well.  It also came with a hands-free attachment, but it was a little tight and uncomfortable.

The Pet Fit for Life Hands Free Dog Leash really is PERFECT!

Things I really love about this leash:

1.  At 72"" long, not only is it twice the length of our old leash, the hands-free attachment has ample room for a variety of waistlines, from 24""-48"".  Walking our dog hands free is so convenient and comfortable with no stress on our hands and arms.  We are free to focus on the walk, not on keeping the dog in line.
2.  The bungee cord is securely covered by very strong, weather-resistant nylon material.  Our old one didn't have a covering and was looking very tattered with the elastic threads popping out.
3. There are 3 handles you can hold to control your dog, including the very nice foam grip handle, which is easy on my arthritic fingers, thank you very, very much.
4.  Reflective threads are sewn into the leash for night time visibility.
5.  Extremely reasonable price for such a high quality product, even if it wasn't on sale.

UPDATE 3/21/2017  One Con that's easily hacked:

In my experience, the long elastic leash is too long to easily maintain control of a dog inside a store.  Tying a quick knot or two in the leash takes care of the excess length, so it still gets a five star rating from me.

And just so you know, I am not affiliated with this company and received nothing for my review.  I honestly love this product!",1
Great brush!,1

"I love these tags.. I was able to choose my font, and personalize both the front and the back. The crystals really sparkle. It is a gorgeous tag, and it gives me extra peace of mind, on top of my cat's being micro-chipped.

"i went through 2 of these crappy things, after the 2nd one broke down after only a couple of months, I decided enough was enough.  Did some research and found the litter-robot.  I was a bit put off because of the price, but didn't want to go back to hand scooping and damn sure wasn't going to buy another piece of crap littermaid, so I broke down and purchased one, called them up and told them I needed one ASAP!, the customer service lady was great, got me one out in the mail the next day.  This thing works like a dream, bought a box of 500 8 gallon trash bags at Sams club for $7.00 and i am good for at least 2 years, quite an improvement over the $13 dollars for 12 receptacles that littermaid sells. And its easier and less messy to change than the littermaid.  I think the litter-robot also has an 18 month warranty, It would take 3 or 4 littermaids to last that long!  I will forever be a litter-robot customer",0

"This toy is a very cute idea, and one of my cats, which is a very petite 5 lb. (although fully grown), was instantly drawn to it, and was having a great time repeatedly smacking the little mouse, which does spin quite easily. Unfortunately, it couldn't stand up to more than 1 day of her playing with it. The carpeted portion was completely pulled off, and the little mouse was tail-less before much time had passed. I also noticed before the carpeted part was pulled off, that when kitty was sitting on the top section, it was noticeably bowing in the center, despite her slight weight. I wouldn't have much hope of it handling my larger, and much heavier cats (which she wasn't allowing to have a turn until the ""fun"" parts were gone, and she wasn't interested anymore). I suppose I could get some fabric adhesive and try gluing the carpeted portion back on, and figure out a more durable tail for the little mouse (which while it lasted, grabbing for the tail was apparently the biggest source of excitement for my cat) but it is stuck in a cabinet for now, and I'll have to decide whether to bother with that as opposed to just throwing it away.

For $15+ this was quite a disappointment, for me, and the cats.",0
"Loved the idea, but the ball material was too soft and pliable and my lab mix ripped the ball apart in half a day.  One day I will probably buy her another one but not put treats inside because she loved the ball itself.",0

"This heater's temp setting is as loose as a goose - not accurate at all. Tested on an EMPTY (no fishies or plants thank goodness) aquarium that had a heater already in it. Temp was 74. We have 3 thermometers - one digital, one float-about, and one glass sticky (which I don't depend on too much, but it gives me a quick reference). Anyway, we put the heater in and let it acclimate for 3 hours. We turned it up until it clicked on. You'd think we'd be around 74, right?  WRONG! It was closer to 66. (Maybe it's because we're back on standard time?...just kidding!! It just made about that much sense.) Anyway, thinking maybe the response was just delayed, we turned it down again, and went much slower - giving 5-10 seconds between adjustments. Still turned on at around 66.

But that isn't even the worst part. This is: We removed the old heater and watched the temp. The heater didn't click on until the temperature (measured by our thermometers) dropped to around 65, and it stayed on for what seemed to be forever - until it reached 76 degrees!! I was just ready to unplug the thing when it finally clicked off. That is one mighty big swing, folks! I'm glad I was being methodical and patient about setting up this new tank, or my fish would have been seriously stressed.

If you care about your fish, and I'm sure you do or you wouldn't be looking for a heater, DO NOT get this one. Move on.

As a side note:  Heater is advertised ""fully submersible"". When you first open the box, the cardboard insert has a sticker on it that says ""fully submersible"". However, when you read through the booklet, it says clearly to leave the top above the waterline. <head scratch> I found a YouTube video that says they don't recommend fully submersible use. Frustrated, I found Aquatop's email and wrote to them asking if it's fully submersible or not. They said yes.  ...for what it's worth!",0

"This harness has been very helpful to walk my dog, instead of my dog walking me.  It is comfortable on him, and I really like the reflective trim for evening walks.  My only dislike, and the reason for not giving the fifth star, is the plastic clips that attach the top of the harness to the bottom.  I wish they were more durable.  One got chewed and mangled to the point that it no longer will clasp (not while the dog was wearing the harness).  I was able to permanently glue that side together, and have learned to keep it out of his reach when not in use, but still I figure that items intended for large dogs would be designed to be a little more ""chew resistant"".  Other than that, I love this harness, and so does my big pup.",1
"The ""smart"" part of the door is the only smart thing about it. Not well made, doesn't fit a standard outside wall. The ""adapters"" they sell to go with it don't fit well and are flimsy. After carving a gigantic hole in my wall, I was committed to installation. Thank goodness I have sufficient home improvement skills or this could have been a disaster.",0
"The material they use for the bed is very cheap and it doesn't even close securely on the frame.  I was hoping there was a pin or something but there's nothing, it's just a sock over a frame.  It's not taught and sags when your cat gets on it.",0
"Collar does not work,difficult to adjust the settings. Battery has to be charged all the time. The correction was very minimal,does not work on a large breed dog.  I expected a lot more for the price,the walmart collar for $40 works better. I do not recommend.",0
Awful. Dull and hard to hold.,0
After reading the reviews I bought a medium size for my 18lb puppy. Its still a little baggy on him but I think I think its a better fit than a small would have been. Like other reviews mentioned its not made for boy dogs so I had to alter it but after I did that its a very nice little jacket for cold days. I like the material its soft but still warm. Pretty good product except its not made for boy dogs.,1
"I have a 7 month old yorkie terrier and decided to use this on him to prevent fleas and ticks. Before using it, he would scratch a lot and he's end up with scabs on his chest and head. Fellow dog owner friends thought it might have been a tick or something but, he really was just scratching too hard. So, after the nail clipping, he would still scratch super hard and super often. I decided to get this product and was hopeful that it would help with his itching along with flea and tick prevention. Since using it, I've noticed a significant change in his scratching habits. He still scratches but, it's not nearly as much and is possibly also caused by dry skin issues. We've also never had a flea or tick issue and he goes outside quite a bit.  His hair is also a bit more mat than it was but, it's still soft and shiny. I have this product a 4 because, I don't know for 100% sure that it kills the fleas and ticks as he's never had them. But, it's a great shampoo and so far, a great prevention.

Also, one of the negative reviews left was about using it on some cats. The product very clearly says ""do not use on cat. So, obviously, that user's review is irrevant. Please, follow the instructions and use on your dogs!",1
"I have 2 HAIR BALL of a Dogs. One is extremely furry and the other is like needle hair. The clippers took to the task and made them look lovely!

Very Happy Camper!",1
I just looked up this purchase so I could recommend it to my son. I read some of the reviews complaining that it broke or was poorly made. I first bought another brand off Amazon and it did break after a month or two. In comparison this scooper is well made and durable. I leave it outside in the winter and I was afraid the plastic would get hard and break. It has held great all winter in the Alaska cold.,1
"The most irritating was the sprayer leaked and had to wear gloves to use it.  Saw a a couple dead fleas after spraying, but ultimately did not do much to get rid of the fleas.  The smell as in a lot of reviews was not overwhelming.  A waste of time and money.",0
MY CAT HAD NO INTEREST IN THIS TOY AT ALL,0
"Easy on/off, super visible day and night (w light reflection), and quality construction. Perfect for making my dogs highly visible during hunting and snowmobile seasons.",1
I have red spots in my carpet AND my puppys fur is reddened from these treats. He also took his time and hasn't even finished the second one. If I didn't have to pay for return shipping I would return these. Very surprised considering who makes them. Never had a problem with the bully sticks.,0
"My cats love this!  It holds more weight that I expected just based on the suction cups, although I have not tested it up to 30#.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was not able to have in on my window in the winter, when it's freezing or colder outside.  The suction cups didn't stick, which my cats weren't too disappointed since it was too cold to be that close to the window.  Maybe if you have better quality windows it would work in cold temps.  But the rest of the year it worked great for me and I would like to add another one.",1
Only worked for two months....don't waste our money!,0
The foam looked a lot thicker on line. It is not an orthopedic mat.  It didn't last long before the dogs chewed it up.,0
Well made,1
"I'm no longer ordering this product, because of the increase in price.",1
It didn't work.,0
Lasted 2 minutes!,0
"I have 3 cats and they only eat gravy-based cat foods, so I thought they would like a gravy supplement.  None of them will eat this product, nor will they eat any cat food that is on the same plate as the SuperGravy, even if it is not touching it.  I mixed it with boiling water, and it is NOT the consistency of a gravy.  It contains chia seeds (why would pets want to eat chia seeds??), which are not ground up and prevent the mixture from ever achieving the consistency of a gravy.",0
It's a great car seat for my dog,1
Great thanks,1
Best pooper scooper I've ever owned. I love my dogs but I hate picking up their poop. This product makes a nasty job a lot easier.,1
I have been very pleased with EVERY Halo product I have purchased for my dogs.  I love that they use only the best ingredients and have never EVER had any recalls!!  Nice to find a healthy well balanced treat!!,1
No match for our pup.  Has chewed all the green part off in a matter of days.,0
Very sturdy and quality of the material is great. Cats used it immediately. Sets up in 10 seconds! I would buy again and may buy a few for around the house. Definitely worth it.,1
As expected,1
"works as expected, wish for better color choices",1
"This litter matt was kind of a pain.  The idea of it is really great, but when it came time to pull it out from under the box and dump out the litter it caught, it always made a HUGE mess!  Plus, my cats did not really like stepping on it.  Cats can be really finicky though about the weirdest things. We used it for about six weeks then found something different. It  unfortunately ended up being more trouble than it was worth IMHO.  I hate giving negative reviews, its not my thing. I always try to find something positive about a product. But this one just made such a mess.",0
My cat loves it.,1
"I love the product. I have been using it for months. However, it seems that there is no consistency in quality. Last order I received the litter was not clumping.",0
"My dogs love their Pegetables.  Since one of my dogs has some digestive problems, I needed to find a snack that is good for him. I found it in these! Evidently they are quite tasty, because both my dogs look forward to receiving one every morning. They know the routine...out to the bathroom; in to get your Pegetable! They are a semi-hard treat that has also done a fantastic job on keeping their teeth clean. The vet has been very happy with their teeth.",1
"These caps seem great at first. They took a few attempts to get them to stay on the first couple of days, but eventually they stayed in.

However, they have since refused to come off. It's been about 3 months and both of my cats still have half of their caps. There is visible litter and feces stuck in them, and you can see where their claws are splintering all the way down to the root. Worst of all, my cats keep getting them stuck in things. My boyfriend has already had to use scissors to cut my cat out of our blinds and the lace shower curtain because the cap was so stuck we couldn't free her. I'm so glad we were home when it happened, because she was yowling and trying to bite us as we tried to free her, obviously in pain and terrified.

 I tried trimming the end of the plastic, as the sites FAQ says this will ""loosen the adhesive"" and help them come off, so hopefully that works.

Even if you don't care about hurting your cat because you're an inhuman creep, they don't even fully work because you can't put them on the back claws. It prevents scratching, but not running around the house or across furniture, which still leaves scratches and puncture marks with their back paws.",0
it fit thank you,1
very good well made product.,1
"My vet asked me what I was using to keep my dogs (pugs) teeth well maintained...I told him of this product and he was surprised....I even bought one for his Vet Tech and she, as well as I, can't afford teeth cleaning every few months....this product doesn't allow the tarter to stick to the teeth and so I can remove a lot of the tarter my hand with a toilette...works well.",1
"Great item. Got several different hair-type cats, and it works well with them. Better than using noisy clippers, and cheaper. Doing the whole body really sucks with them though, naturally. Always get a blister on my knuckle from it but thats okay, its better than letting a huge cat with long hair be in a hot spot. I trim them fully down using the #3 near the beginning of warm weather, and again right as the deadly heat of summer arrives. They love it! Well, some love the process, and others dont, but in the end they love how light and cool it makes them feel! Currently looking into actual Silent Clipper though for the ones that don't mind the scissors, now that they're used to being trimmed!",1
Have a great dane and this is perfect for him. He loves it.,1
"I had previously received a very good product, twice, from this company. But this time I was very disheartened when I opened the box. About 3/4 of the hay upon receipt was old, dry, yellow and curled. I think the company knew that the hay was old and going bad because they stuffed about 2 times the normal amount in there. But twice as much hay my pigs won't eat is not worth any more. My guinea pigs would only eat about 1/4 of the box. Waste of money and a big disappointment from a previously good company.",0
"I have two cats: Skinny Girl and Fat Boy (not their real names). SG has kidney issues and is on an expensive prescription food. FB is overweight and is on diet food. You can guess what happened every single day at my house. SG would eat some, as she's very much a grazer, and then walk away. FB would arrive minutes later and scarf down the leftovers.

But no more! I got the SureFeed today after shopping around, and I honestly can't praise it enough. After darting out to get some C batteries, I set it up in a matter of minutes. Batteries in, swap the bowl, lay down the mat. Place where SG's feeder normally goes. I put SG's rx wet food in the non-split bowl and spread it out a bit to avoid the flap catching it. SG was raring to go, and once I put the bowl in and closed the lid she walked into the hoop readily. I pressed the Add Pet button, the flap came up, SG happily ate and the SureFlap memorized her microchip.

(As an aside, the microchip was what won me over to the SureFlap - SG has a bad habit of escaping and a worse habit of losing her collar. She bricked a $30 rfid key-based feeder by losing the key outside. With this, I don't have to worry at all.)

I pulled her out of the hoop and let her watch it close, and then gently nudged her back in so she could see it open. SG is a dangerous combination of clever and confident, and picked up on the whole 'approach and food is available' trick in a hurry, so I didn't need to use the learning mode. Can't remark on it as such, but if it's half as good as the setup and memorize mode, I wager it's quick and painless.

And finally, the piece de resistance! FB arrived right on cue a few minutes later and started eagerly sniffing around. He did manage to steal a few tidbits that had fallen on the mat, but to my delight, he couldn't figure out the SureFlap and left (mostly) empty-pawed. (Grain-of-salt addition: FB is not very aggressive or destructive. YMMV if your food thief is more prone to knocking stuff over or pawing/clawing).

Yes, the SureFlap isn't cheap. But in less than 15 minutes it has solved two problems in a clean and easy way. FB can't steal his sister's food and will finally lose some weight, and SG can actually graze and maybe put on that pound or two the vet's been nagging me about. After trying for well over a year to keep FB out of SG's food (and failing, no matter what we tried), I'm glad to say the issue's finally been put to bed.

Thank you SureFlap!",1
Overpriced for quality level. The rings that hold the bowls in are flimsy. When the water bowl is filled halfway up it leans so much that I really could fill it up more with out it spilling out. I would have returned it but it solved my issue of my shorter pet stealing the dog's food.,0
"The cats love to be combed with this. No pulling, and really gets off alot of hair.",1
"After trying other brands and forms of this much needed 'Joint-Eze' this is the best I've found!  My picky, spoiled dog loves them and they have helped her so much.  She has trouble with her hips and these keep her active without pain.  THANK YOU!!!  Jean",1
Works very well for a short period of time and doesn't seem to cause health problems with our dogs.,1
Terrific product! Works great on cat urine.,1
Dog Loves the food,1
These things are so great!  If you have trouble with your dog pulling you too much...this does the trick. Would remind you of a horse halter in that if he pulls too hard his head turns instead of pulling your arm out of its socket. Something about it calms my energetic Husky the minute I put it on him.  Makes our walks a pleasure for both of us...instead of an embarrassing struggle. I got this one for my daughter's huge Shepherd...it worked! Now she can walk him again.,1

"I am a veterinarian exclusively making house calls, and this clipper has the power and minimal noise to be very useful in the field.

"Be extraordinarily careful when buying these extensions to make sure you're getting the right one.  According to what it says in the description, these extensions are supposed to fit ""Extra Tall Gate, Model #0941PW"".  However, while this extension is 41"" tall, gate Model #0941PW is only 36"" tall.  That's another thing... Carlson apparently labels more than one height of their pet doors as ""Extra Tall"".  So, I strongly caution, regardless of what model number they're telling you their extensions fit... DOUBLE CHECK GATE HEIGHT TO EXTENSION HEIGHT to avoid the same issue I had.  I've inserted the product link for the gate I purchased below so you can see which one I'm referring too.  I've also included a photo of the box the gate was sent in showing that Carlson labels Model #0941PW as ""Extra Tall"" even though, as you can see by the photo, that specific ""Extra Tall"" gate is only 36"" tall.

"Almost immediately on the first day the collar began to leak after being filled. When the collar is full, it will shut up your annoying barking dog who barks constantly.

"I don't ever write reviews, but this warrants it. I am a new cat owner, and for the last year have struggled with litter boxes, liners, hoods, mats, deodorizers, litters, etc. Not only was the smell awful, but walking on the litter that gets scattered on the floor drove me nuts. So I saw the video for this system, and decided to give it a go. We put it next to my cats old litter box and even put some of his poop in it. We put him in the new box (which they say not to do), he sniffed, then jumped out, and then we left the new litterbox there next to the old one for 3 days. He still used his old box religiously but would occasionally go into the new box and smell around. Finally, I removed the old litterbox and put the new one in its place. He meowed and fussed a little bit, but he used it nonetheless. Finally after a week, he was enjoying moving all the pellets around and really liking the texture of the new litter.

Now all we smell is poop right after he goes. So we scoop that out once a day, and presto, the smell is gone. I change the pad once a week. About 1 pellet finds its way out of the box every couple of days, so I just pick it up and throw it back in - and I'm actually getting so spoiled that even that little tiny bit of effort annoys me.

No dust, no vacuuming, no litterbox smell, no scraping the clumped litter off the bottom of the box. I honestly don't know how I lived without this. It is worth the time to switch your cat, don't rush it.

UPDATE: 3 months of use, and I love it even more. It is the easiest and cleanest litter box ever. I can't believe how little effort it takes, and how clean it is.",1

"I have 2 girls, a catahoula cur dog & a pitbull. My pit has had horrible allergies since we got her 5 months ago when she was 7 months old. She'd had been missing patches of hair on her face & tail area. I had taken her to my vet & he said it was flea dermatitis, she was allergic to fleas & tearing herself apart. I had gotten them an all natural flea treatment called flea away I got it on Amazon & after 30 days it finally started working & by the 50th day no more bugs (didn't have to bomb the house or treat my yard !) BUT she was still covered in hot spots & was getting frequent skin infections which worried me to the point where I couldn't sleep because she was so miserable. I was feeding them purina beyond pumpkin & salmon which is only a few dollars cheaper then this food. My vet suggested she could have food allergies & to look around.

"I have had three E collars over time and I have found this collar to be the best by far. I had an old pre-Garmin Tri-Tronics which was nice but lacked adjustment. It ran 1 to 7 high/low. I then had a Garmin Tri-Tronics Pro550 which is allegedly the most powerful (not that I needed it) and consistent delivery collar available. I found the delivery of the correction was terrible and the hand control unit was ridiculously large and a little complex. I use the collar on my patrol dog and a cumbersome remote is not an option.

The Super X gives me all that I need in a remote collar. Power, consistency, adjustability and a remote that you can deploy with if it's for a working dog. I would definitely recommend this collar.",1
Chipped away very easily while my dogs were chewing on them. So many sharp pieces I had to take them away from my pups. If you are worry some about obstructions in your pups stomach I wouldn't recommend these bones. I threw the rest away.,0

"Though these were the most reflective collars I have ever seen, all five outdoor TNR cats were collar-free in less than two weeks.  I understand they need to be able to escape from being hung up on anything but the clasp appears to be easily opened.

Was really hoping to use them on the rest of the colony in hopes of keeping them safe from being hit by cars.",0
My little Cavalier looks great in this little turtleneck.  Perfect fit and easy to put on too.,1
The collar is well constructed but the cinch wasn't able to hold its adjustment when being pulled by my energetic dog.,0
"I bought this product about two and a half years ago and it's still going strong. My cats LOVE it. I've noticed that they drink a lot more water with this than they used to with just a normal water dish. It can be used with or without the filters (though it's nice to have them). Cleaning is super easy, it may be a little tricky to take apart the motor but it does come apart. I have well water and all it takes for me is a little vinegar soak and scrub and it's just like new again. It's also nice that it holds so much water so you won't have to worry about refilling very often. As far as noise I don't really notice anything maybe a slight hum, but that's usually if the water level is getting low. I have and would recommend this to anyone. Your kitties (and smaller dogs) will thank you!
EDIT: I've included a picture to compare the size of the fountain to my smallish (about 7lb cat). Also another pro that I did not mention was how high up the water stream is, which is something that I really wanted in a pet fountain since my cats always seemed to enjoy drinking from the faucets.",1

Extremely disappointed I have had two of these filters 55/75 less than a year and have to keep fixing both of them.

Works great as a chicken waterer so they have fresh water all winter long. Keeps the water from freezing so far but we have only had afew really cold nights.,1
"I was so excited when I received this to put it my catio. Excited, until I opened it and saw how tiny it is. My cat is only 6 pounds, pretty small for a cat. There is no way that my cat could fit on this. Disappointed. Off to the trash bin......",0

"Good keeps the dog from being a torpedo and killing everyone in the car if theres an accident.  Hooks right into the car seat and is adjustable so the dog can't jump into the front seat or off of the back seat.  Make sure you use a harnass on your dog though, I would not attach it to a collar around the neck unless you want a dog with a broken neck.!.",1

My cat Quincy loves this ball! So much so that I bought many of them. He chases it all around the room and then he hides it. We cant find it so we pull ourt,1

Is perfect,1

"As many have said, the clamp does not hold horizontal bars onto the vertical bars.  The horizontal expanders move freely, allowing your dog to go around the barrier.  The vertical adjustment does not hold, requiring daily re-tightening.  I'm very mechanically inclined and this product is POORLY DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED.  The only way it will work is to modify it and that is a mark of a poor product.  Will return.",0
"I have a German Shepard mix with hip issues (surprise) and have had her on Platinum Performance (and other products: Cosequin). I originally received my first supply from the vet...I still love Platinum, but the price of this item is so reasonable and she does so well on it. I can tell a difference when she's on it and when she's not. She's no spring chicken and this product certainly helps her joints in the cold winter months. I simply sprinkle this on her dry food and swish some water on it - she gobbles it right up.

I would recommend this for any pet owner looking for a little relief and support.",1

Thats 2 shorter in width than advertised. Also the side door is not flush with the rest of the cage which makes it difficult to slide into spaces.",1

"The earlier reviewer who questioned this product's safety is absolutely correct. My dog vomited the bones back up, resulting in one of them becoming lodged in his throat.

"I LOVE THE LITTER GENIE!!!! I have two indoor cats and two litter boxes. Keeping up with cleaning regularly has always been tough, but the litter genie has completely solved that problem. Now I scoop a few times a day, no ordeal, no mess. Definitely worth the money.",1
"I got this for my 8 pound cat who is on the small side. The description says that the weight limit is 30 pounds. Any animal that weighs 30 lbs will be WAY too big for this. My cat could barely move and kept escaping out the top - even with the leash attachment hooked to her harnass. I ended up just letting her wander my car instead of making her stay in this tiny thing. This is maybe big enough for a kitten or a very small dog. If your animal is too big to carry in a purse, they are probably too big for this.

Also, no way to really strap this in in the car. I tried sliding my seat belt through the back strap, but it wasn't very secure. It's definitely not something I would feel comfortable with my cat in for a long ride.

The top opening doesn't have a way to stay closed - the velcro comes up easy, and my cat could make the zipper open just by poking her head up. Using the leash attachment didn't help, and she kept getting stuck trying to get out.

I'd heard a lot of people love the soft sided carriers and that pets are more comfortable in them, but after how stressed out this made my cat, I will stick with her hard plastic carrier. This is going back in the box and getting returned today.",0

I have been buying this brand for a few years. The most recent shipment of these was disappointing. They are much lighter and not as dense as they used to be.

Also my do g is fluffy right now as he hasn't been groomed and it's still a little big.  But overall,  great buy and the price point is to die for. Ordered black and blue in xxl for my Jarvis.",1

"I am on my second order as I don't ever want to run out.  Love the scent and these little bags make my clean up efforts so much easier  I have a small dog, but he still needs to be cleaned up after especially if I can't keep him out of someone else's yard.  Great product!!",1
"I wanted something to help keep my dog's mind off of me leaving the house.  I'm glad I ordered the Large as it's smaller than I expected it to be.  My dog is 53 pounds and this works well, not sure I'd want it much bigger to be honest.  I drop in several treats, give it a shot of easy treat, and then finish it off by adding a Kong cookie hanging out the end.  This combination works well and keeps him busy for maybe 10 minutes.  :)",1

"We bought this for use with a foster dog who is on crate rest. She's a good dog without behavior issues, but crate rest gets boring and we were having some issues with barking/whining. This collar kept her calm and quiet overnight. I took it off this morning, and she was back to her whiney self! It's definitely useful for certain dogs in certain situations... I'm not sure how it would work for a dog with serious anxiety, but for our bored pup, it kept her calm and let her get some much needed rest so she can heal.",1

"I thought we were going to lose our Buddy for sure when I first noticed he had signs of Wet Tail. His bottom was wet and he wasn't eating. Even after I started the drops I thought he was going to die for the first few days because he declined so quickly. It took several days of days of treatment but I started to slowly see signs that he was getting better! I gave him the drops directly, with the medicine dropper. I know you can put them in the water but I wasn't sure how much he was drinking. After about 7 days, he made a complete recovery! I feel a few key things helped him as well - 1. Make sure they are getting water. If not, then put some water in a dropper and get it to them that way. Otherwise they will get dehydrated very quickly. 2. One thing I found he loved and also helped him stay hydrated was baby oatmeal mixed with milk or water. He wouldnt eat his regular food while he was sick as it seemed he was too weak to eat anything that took a lot of effort.",1

Together the total cost was something like $13. Great value.",1

"I've owned exclusively Sportdog collars for both my invisible fence and field training devices for years and need a bark collar for my 1 year old puppy as my neighbors were becoming annoyed with her.  I figured I needed a SportDog collar as I wanted a quality product.  When I opened it, it was like every other SportDog collar I've purchased before, it seemed like quality.

However, after a few months of use it now does not seem to work.  No matter what setting it is on it does not correct my dog.  Also, there have been a few times where it just randomly will begin shocking her multiple times and caused her to whimper in pain until I was able to get it off and take the battery out.  This concerns me as I like having the collar to make a correction when my dog is barking, but not when she is being quiet and literally laying down.  This is just confusing for my dog.  I'd love to say this is another great product by SportDog, but unfortunately here I cannot.",0
"I bought this at Amazon for under $50 and it's a great product. It's probably not as great as the $150 clippers on the market, but it is definitely better than items in it's price range, and I just didn't want to put down over $100 without knowing if i would even stick to clipping my own dog. But after receiving these and now having done 2 hair cuts, I am very happy I chose this one. I don't recommend spending over $60 for it, and usually it's less here, so if it's more, just wish list it and wait, i'll come down.

First of all, i LOVE that it's cordless, love. SO glad i got a cordless clipper. As for the clippers, I use them on a dog with fine, cottony hair and it does a great job. My cuts don't come out looking great because I haven't really taken the time, so i can't say whether my fine cottony haired dog needs expensive clippers to get there, but I am so happy with these. My dog is 8lbs and it takes me less than half hour to cut his hair down from over an inch long to a half inch all over. I live in nyc where it costs $75! for a grooming session! Ridiculous. My dog is scared of the hair dryer but not these clippers! that is great. If you go on Wahl's youtube channel they have tons of videos on how to use them. I never even bothered with those, i just aim to make the hair shorter and it works. I Would definitely buy these clippers again. After much research before buying, i know I made the right choice. Oh, and the rest of the kit, i tossed the scissors, the mirror and the case, they're pretty useless.

Update: I just finished my 5th home haircut and it is the best cut so far, actually looks pretty decent! Yay! that means i've saved 75 x 5 - 40, $335! : ). If this one pooped out at anytime then and only then would I even consider getting on of the $150 high end models, but I am so glad I got this one my first go around and may even buy it again if it poops out.

update: i just learned that the battery in this is replaceable! That is great. It is $20 on amazon. But I also see that you can get an Andis AGC single speed (not cordless), which are supposed be better, on *bay for about $90 and $100 on amazon. The andis gives you more options, like more blades that fit and the ability to use Wahl stainless steel combs but they get crazy hot!!,

Andis $100+ Single Speed heavy duty vs. $50ish Wahl Pro Series

-The biggest difference (and the biggest benefit) is that the Andis can use blades of different lengths, instead of plastic comb attachments, and blades by themselves are always better than plastic attachments, especially if you have a few knots. I really liked using a 4FC blade, i was able to take off more hair with each run of the clipper than the wahl because of the dedicated blade and i was able to push through knots.

-But my goodness, the blade on the andis gets hot soooo fast. At least 2-3x as fast as the Wahl. It got pretty hot after 10-15 minutes and then had to stop every 5 minutes and take off the hot blade and put it under a bag of frozen peas. A serious pita.

-Using the Andis made me realize how much better it is to have a cordless clipper.

-The $100+ Andis is about the same sound volume as the Wahl pro series. The Andis is about 50%+ heavier than the Wahl and I can feel it, blech.

The haircut with the andis didn't seem to look any better than with the Wahl (maybe a tad because with dedicated blades there are few tracks than with snap on combs), and although the motor is slightly better on the Andis, and even though it cut faster, really wasn't a big deal, esp since my dog is small, and i feel like the amount of time i had to spend cooling this thing off negated most of my time saving. During the haircut, while waiting for the blade on the Andis to cool down i did some scissor work on the face and used the Wahl without any attachments to do the sanitary trims (or whatever i needed that #10 blade for).  That being said, I have a single coated dog. For those who have dogs with a thick undercoat, i can't say for sure that the wahl will do what you need.

I wouldn't necessarily give up my wahl for the more expensive, professional andis pair; the heat and the cord are a real PITA. And for the Wahl to be as good as it is, and actually be cordless, it is exceptional for the price. I actually like having both.

Oh, AND, the cordless wahl is great because 1/2 hour after finishing my dog's haircut i saw something i wanted to even out. No problemo, the Wahl was easier to just grab and cut, no unravelling a cord, plugging in, etc.

Update 3/13. I've done quite a few haircuts now. If you are looking for a clipper under $60, the Wahl Pro-series is so great, but if you are looking for a slightly faster haircut, and want a more professional look that plastic combs can't always give (unless you know how to use a pair of scissors well), don't go for the Andis, look into the Wahl Bravura (cordless) instead.

Oh, and btw, if you want to go that extra step in your grooms, as in, an adorable haircut on a malt or yorkie, westie, whatever, I recently bought a few of Jodi Murphy's dvds and my grooms are so much better. They're $35 on cherrybrook, petedge and jodimurphy.net (and the resale value is pretty high on ebay/amazon). My last groom i only used my $50 Wahl Pro-series, and a $20 pair of scissors and he looks great.",1
Fits way small and return policy is horrible.,0
"My cat doesn't like them, which is the whole point, so in that respect they work great. She has given up on trying to shred the arms of the recliner I put them on. The only problem I had is that I couldn't use the furniture screws because of the way my chair is constructed (there's wood under the fabric on one side) so I've had to tape them to chair with clear packing tape. So far they're staying in place. They're sturdy and they protect the arms of my chair well. I'd love to have one bigger one to put on the foot rest of my recliner since the cat is now going after that.",1

"****Update***** Shortly after the 30 day return period ended, the collar developed major issues with inconsistent stim. Dogtra would not return or exchange, even though it is such a new collar and I send video showing it malfunctioning with the testing light on. Instead I have to wait for an unknown amount of weeks with no ecollar for my dog when I just forked over $230 for a collar that says ""Proven Reliability"" on the box.
Compare this to the customer service that Ecollar Technologies provides: if you experience any problems within the 2 year full coverage period, they will immediately ship out a replacement and send a prepaid return slip for the defective unit. I'll be buying ecollars from them from now on.
I would highly recommend against buying this collar, not only for the terrible customer service and potential inconvenience, but also because I wouldn't trust in the reliability (of this model at least). What if the collar happeens to fail on you when you need it most.
I've been a loyal Dogtra customer for years and this is such a disappointment.

---------------------------------------------------

I have owned numerous models of Dogtra collars, and currently have a dogtra arc and this 1900s. Compared to the ARC, the dial is a little more sturdy and less easy to accidentally move around while its in your pocket. The rubber cover thing for the charging ports is more firmly covered (the seal was pretty loose on my ARC). I really like that they added a button to turn off the receiver rather than having to touch the remote to the collar to turn it off. Much more convenient. The other improvement is that they made the vibrate/pager more noticeable to the dog than with the ARC. To me it doesn't seem that much stronger of a vibrate, but its a little noisier if that makes sense.

Its a lot more bulky than the arc though, and would definitely recommend the arc if your dog doesn't need the higher levels (most probably don't).

Overall I've been happy with it, but after my new dog is fully ecollar trained and I can be sure he won't need the higher levels of stem, I'll buy the Arc for him instead because of the smaller side. Im just sticking with this model because he's very flighty and had an extremely intense prey drive, and I want to be sure I have the higher levels in case of emergency during the beginning stages of off leash training. :)

Another note: I don't find these streamlined collars to have a more comfortable fit for the dogs like they advertise. They are actually not as great of a fit because the entire bulk of the receiver is under the strap,  pressing into the dog's neck. The pressure is less evenly distributed. In my case, the streamlined design is worth it because of people in my area's perception of dogs with ecollars. People here are more likely to be scared seeing an off leash dog with an ecollar, and also in a small community, rumors might spread about my dogs being unfriendly and dangerous (even though they are actually overly friendly). With this design combined with my dogs' fluffiness, no one can tell its an ecollar. Also as someone who is very into photography, my pictures look a little nicer as well.

If you don't mind the boxed receiver look though, I'f highly recommend the Dogtra 2300 instead. The fit is better and the quality of the remote is much nicer(especially the dial)! Its as good or better in absolutely every way besides not having that handy off button on the receiver.

Also some good resources for ecollar training: Jeff Gellman, Sean O' Shea (EXCELLENT new DVD out), and Lou Castle. All of these trainers have a ton of good free content online thats easy to learn from. :)",0

This coupler works very well. My older dog, who prefers to walk the full length of the leash behind me is not being rushed or pulled by my younger dog, who likes to be exactly at my hip. We are not getting tangled in the leash when we walk. The quality of the leashes and coupler are super - definitely durable enough for the 140lb of dog that I walk.",1

"Despite some dismal reviews we ordered this product anyway due to the price. Shipping time was good, quality is excellent and the product performs perfectly. Some of the reason for this is the quality of the product but a large part of the success for us is that we had reasonable expectations from the start. This is just a strap to clip my dog's collar to the seatbelt to provide some security. I did not expect it to function as a leash, as a harness or for any other purpose.",1
Does not work!! Pictures look great but the actual product I received looked like a kids toy and did I mention it DOES NOT WORK!!!,0
"I was very disappointed. We have a busy family and I did not get around to watching the second disc in the series for several months after we bought it. Bottom line, the disc does not work. I contacted the seller, they told me they could do ""nothing"" and to contact Amazon, and I checked the Amazon website and all they told me was that the product was out of the return window.  In the past, I have been able to get a replacement disc, so this was a very disappointing response.",0
"I have bought a number of these and the most recent snapped off second or third use--the tape then vanished into the handle, making it unusable.  I am now looking for another kind of retractable leash.",0
Used this when I couldn't find Malaseb. Works just as good. My new go to for my dogs Schnauzer bumps,1
"the best ,cleanest ever,last much longer. EVEN THE CAT LOVES IT.MUCH CHEAPER IN THE END ,BECAUSE THERE IS NO WASTE.",0
Extremely dried out and had no scent at all. Our bunny would not eat it.,0
It worked to remove the smell of cat pee after like 5 applications.  We solved the problem by identifying why the cat was not using the litter box and fixing it.,0
"I have their horse size for my Morgan and it works great.  The Arabian size is a bit big except for the ears which are too short. I didn't strap it overly tight because it then bent the top inch of her ears and as a result she was able to slide the whole thing off.  I guess someone forgot Arabs have longer ears than other breeds. I gave it 2 stars because the horse size is excellent and has never come off, is sturdy, and fits great. It is easy to clean and can be used over the bridle when I ride too. I will have to alter the Arabian size to fit her better because the other aspects of the mask are excellent.",0
"Bought this for son's dog.  It broke the first time he used it.  May be cheaper, than the top brand, but not worth it.",0

"This toothbrush is not really small at all, yet the product headline claims that it is for ""Small Breeds"".  It doesn't work for Cavalier King Charles spaniels little mouths.  I can't say how well it would work for any other breed, however I can't imagine this large-head, hard base toothbrush. with multi-directional bristles would work for any small or medium breed dog without hurting their mouths.  I've found that a child's toothbrush works much better to brush a dog's teeth, using an enzyme-based toothpaste.",0
Great product,1
"This automatic feeder was exactly what I needed with my current situation. I work very early mornings and having an automatic feeder reduces the amount of things I need to take care of before leaving for work, as well as giving me peace of mind. It also keeps the kitties from bugging me when they want to be fed. They no longer associate waking me up with getting fed so I can sleep in a little more!

I also chose this specific product because of the ability to easily change how much food it dispenses. One of my two cats is overweight and I needed a way to measure and slowly reduce their food to the proper amount. Although it is not intuitive, with the help of the directions it is very easy to change the amounts dispensed. On top of that, the feeder holds a LOT of food, which is great because it means I'm never worried about it running out. I check the amount once a week and refill it about once every other week with two cats.

I am very happy with this pet feeder. I'd definitely recommend it for others.",1
Half full. Didnt know Id be buying air...,0
"It was broken and in very poor condition. Because my mother needed it for her small dog, we glued it back together rather than returning it, but I suspect that it will not hold because the areas we glued were so thin.

It was broken in both places where the small gate attaches to the larger gate with dowels. We glued it there.

thanks.",0
Perfect crate for training a puppy.  Well made and easy to fold up.  I use it every day and would only buy Midwest .,1
"High Tech Express Train Collar

First of all, the tons of complaints you read about in the reviews are all true.  To make a long story short, there is NO customer support. You have a problem and you are just screwed.

As well as no customer service, this thing is junk. Biggest problem is the collar with its little plastic cover over the LEDs, on/off switch, and DC Jack for charging. This cover is held on by two itty-bitty little screws that don't even have an insert of brass with threads; it's just screws into plastic. In order to charge the unit or just turn it on or off you have to remove these itty-bitty screws. How long do you think this is going to go on before you lose one of the screws or strip out the plastic threads? Worst design I have ever seen in my life. Obviously not built to last a life time. The strap on the collar is very thin and the hole I used started to rip out with only part of a days walk. I also found out that even though it states on the box that the collar is waterproof, it is not and the company will even tell you ""no, it's not really waterproof"". Aren't there laws against that?

The transmitter is very big, won't fit in any pocket and is very inconvenient and cumbersome to use. The two rows of tone and shock buttons are very close and I find it very hard to keep an eye on my dog and at the same time hit the right button. I couldn't understand why I was getting no response from the dog but then realized I was pushing the #2 shock button and not the #2 tone button. That is how I found out that the shock buttons weren't working. I strapped it on myself to see what the dog was getting. #1 & #2 shock buttons do nothing! A couple of times I think I could feel #3 but #4 did work a little. I have a very strong headed dog and this does nothing to help with training. I like the tone idea but I'm sure there is a make out there with the same idea only it will work. I have a smart dog and he was starting to respond to the tones so I'm sure this idea will work if you use another brand.

I have never been so disappointed with any product that I have ever had to send back. Search the web and read the reviews before you buy this product. Here is a link to a bunch of reviews: [...]
Take a look at all the 1 star reviews. Then rethink doing business with High Tech Pet!!!

Now I'm trying to send it back and can't get anyone to answer my e-mails and the phone calls are all answered with a busy signal.",0
Great idea in theory but clumps get wedged in the grate. Also not very tall and litter was everywhere. Awkward to empty into container. Bought litter boxes with higher edges and went back to scooping. Less problems!,0
"Although a top notch high quality food, it's very rich. Be sure to take at least a couple of months or thereabouts to wean your dog off of his/her original food. (For dogs with sensitive digestive system.)",1
"We have two large dogs who love their toys to death (literally). These are the only toys that last and last. If your dogs destroy their toys, give these a try.",1
one swipe of a paw and off it came.,0
"I was so excited to have a screen with an opening for my vertical tank crested gecko setup. Sadly, the package arrived with multiple holes in the box and the screen twisted completely out of shape. I would love to reorder again - just with more padding in the packaging.",0
It's a really small but she loves it.,1
Did not work when arrived. No idea how to replace battery if possible? Just using it as a regular ball I guess.,0
I love the puppia harness. It fits my 10 month old shorkie perfect. I tease her and say she looks like a super hero in it. She looks so adorable in it. I got it in the pink color. Its the best fitting harness for her and I tried a few until I found the right one. She sits in a carseat and I don't worry if she uncomfortable in it because its so soft and doesn't move around and choke her. I recommened this harness to everyone.,1
"EXCELLENT COMPANY! SUPERB HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS! ( I have purchased 2 different things from them) No cheaply made items here! So buy with confidence. The rep Thank you Abel, could not have been more helpful. I WILL BUY AGAIN!",1
"I can't understand why the reviews are so good for this product. You can clearly see in the seller's picture of the product how poor the quality is. The loose middle fabric and the uneven seams are apparent in the product photo. The material is thin and the whole thing is sewn in a single stitch around the circle. I don't want to be accused of being another brand's promoter, but I ordered another type of soft dog Frisbee and it came double stitched and the center had a lot less loose material. You can definitely tell that this product is inferior in quality. This Frisbee flies a lot shorter than the other one I bought, and my dog loses interest in this one a lot faster.

Buyer beware. Do some more research on this item. That's why I love the internet shopping for convenience, but sometimes you take a gamble on unknown products that you can't see in a store.",0
Very bad don't shave good stop working after 3 week,0
I got this toy specifically for my beagle because I figured he would have trouble tearing it apart and disembowling it. It didn't last ten minutes of his enjoyment and I kept finding bits of it every where.,0
"We bought this large leash after our 70-lb dog broke a similar leash from another manufacturer while chasing a cat.  This one is definitely stronger when it comes to its ability to withstand a sudden force like that.  It reels in smoothly, the buttons work well, etc.

I was a little disappointed in the softness of the plastic, though.  I accidentally dropped it one time, it hit the pavement, and got dragged about 20 feet.  It now has 3 very large scrapes on it from this one incident.  Obviously I don't expect the thing to remain spotless, but two of the three spots are where I put my hand - one on the handle, and one on the button.  These rough spots were so annoying that I took a knife and cut them down smooth, but they're obviously still very noticeable.  It's a small issue, but it's not something I expected to have to deal with on an item at this price.

Other than that, the location of where the leash leaves the handle is kind of awkward - it comes out right in front of your hand, which has a tendency to cause the entire thing to rotate forward somewhat.  It would be more natural and comfortable for the leash to come out on the opposite side from your hand.

Both those are fairly minor things, though, and are really the only problems I had with this leash.  Those issues aside, it's a much better leash than others I've used.  4 stars.",1
"I do not know why, but these little plush toys are great. I have a 36 lbs Aussie Shepard Mix rescue and a Golden Retriever of 76 lbs and they love these things. They seem to endure all the play time and the pups never seem to tear them up. They love the squeak and toss them around almost daily. I do like them for play inside the house without any damage.",1
"I searched on the picture of the packaging and the description before I bought it and it us labeled as a dura chew.  When I received it, I flipped the package over and the back of the box says ""up to 50lbs"".  I'm annoyed because I thought it was a super durable toy.  It was impossible to see the rating before I bought it.",0
"Totally annoying wobbly front wheels! So bummed. 2 stars because both my Havanese and Dachshund  fit fine. But, not happy about the wheels. I have to walk very slow or pick up the back of the stroller to get the wheels in front to STOP WOBBLING! Grrr...!",0
"It turns into concrete at the shear sight of cat urine. I had to throw my cats box out due to this product, it may work for an auto scoop litter box but for regular boxes no way.",0
"Heats well, no light emitted",1
Item arrived on time and as described.,1
Great food for cats that have diabetes,1
The light arrived broken the whole reason I purchased it. I had requested to return just the light portion since I already opened the rest but never heard back. The lease works fine but I could've bought a retractable leash anywhere you can tell the light wasn't properly sodered.,0
"I've tried a couple of different dog bag brands and dispensers, and none really work that well to me.  Unless I take the time before the walk to get the bag open it's always a struggle to detach the bag from the roll and then to get it to open up.  Maybe there's some trick I'm missing, but especially when I have 2 dogs pulling on their leashes while I struggle to open up a bag I'm going to go with what's easiest, and for me ziplocks are a thousand times easier to open.  They do have the disadvantage of being see-through, but garbage cans normally aren't too far away.",0
"My dog was able to pull the covering into her crate, and got tangled up in it.  Very scary!",0
"I was really disappointed in these. We have an Old English Sheepdog puppy and I ordered these to begin keeping the hair between his toe pads and around his face tidy. The size was great but the scissors were not very sharp at all - meaning the blade had difficulty cutting the hair, despite his puppy fuzz being super thin and soft. Additionally, the small screw that holds the two parts together sprung out of the scissors during the first use and we couldn't get it back in again! What a waste! Despite these being inexpensive, we just felt the value for the money was nil. So we returned them.",0
"Ziwipeak changed by dogs health.  He looks so much better and healthy.  Especially for small dogs, the portions are perfect.",1
Tasty good quality dog treat. I chose it because it is made in the USA. Kind of expensive for a small bag but worth it.,1
"This harness is near impossible to adjust and the material its made of gets hung on the poor lizard's spines and scales.

I didn't see any difference in the nitrate reduction which is why I purchased. I will not purchase again. since that is why I bought it for.,0
"By far.. This is our cats' most beloved toy. Both cat and kitten are enthralled by this and the leather is so durable that the toy won't break in 3 days like all the other wands. Best toy purchase I ever made. On a funny note, our visitors always wink and smile thinking it's my ""toy"" left out accidentally. Let them wonder ",1
Did not work at all for my dog..,0
This collar has potential for certain dogs with certain areas that need protecting.  My medium size Lab could easily reach stitches on her back leg wearing this collar and could reach many other places that a traditional plastic cone would protect.  If there had been any disclaimer to that effect I would not have purchased it.  Her neck falls into the XL category but it seemed a bit large on her so I went out to a store and bought a L which was more stable but provided no more protection.  This would work well for protecting areas close to the neck on dogs who are not determined to remove the collar.  So far I am out $60+.,0
"My Persian likes these treats. and they don't give her digestive problems the way some big brand treats do.  If the texture matters to you, these are not crunchy; they have a texture that is more like licorice.  If the size matters to you, these are tiny.",1
The price is not worth the size of the package. I can go to my local pet store and get for 50% cheaper.,0
This cat tree arrived with THREE MISSING PARTS!!!! The box was damaged when arrived but the inside box containing all the parts were unharmed . I laid everything out - three pieces not there and they were giant boards for the bottom of the base. Very irritated - will buy from a diff seller  now .,0

Sadly disappointed in a defective razor.,0
"my dog loves the food, however most of the cans were dented on the bottom from my last order, My dog wouldn't eat any food that came from these dented cans, opened one this morning and food was shrunken and pulled away from the can on the inside. The handling and shipping method is lacking in proper care.",0
"This snaps together and every time I tried to use it, it would come apart.  I threw it in the trash after trying to fix it many many times.",0
I have an aggressive chewer and this was great!,1
"Fancy to look at, but too small for a cat to use. The box is tight and the cats hate it so much that they started to urinate on the carpet around it instead. When I asked to return for this reason, my request was denied. Not recommended!! Poor design!!",0
"This Cat tree is a hazard and should be removed from the market. Unstable, wobbly and tips over very easily.

Assembled pretty easy, however, we could see once it was together it was unstable. The first  time our cat jumped on it, it tipped over and fell. Luckily, my cat was able to get out of the way in time or else it would've fallen on him. He is not a big cat, he just turned a year old. I would be afraid to leave this standing while we were not home because we'd probably come home to find it on the floor or one of our pets injured by it.

I recieved it on 6/16 and put in for a refund on 6/17. This should be labeled ""Kitten Tree"" because that's the only animal size I would trust on this thing. Picture is deceiving as well. It looks like it would be big enough for an adult cat. The round barrel on top is tiny. I couldn't believe how small the cubby hole was.

It's covered in a cheap muppet-like fabric that was shedding everywhere. If my cat made it through the carpet on his current tower in less than a year, then it would take him a week to get through this thin fabric.

Skip over this one, I thought I would save some money but the old saying is true, ""You get what you pay for.."" spend the extra and get a quality one that's covered in heavy duty rug and well built.",0
great!  large size and perfect for a bed protector when the cats want to invade that space.... cats love love this.,1
"These things work well on both my cat and dog, and make brushing their teeth so much easier than with a standard toothbrush. Highly recommended if you want to improve the dental hygiene of your pets.",1
Finally the perfect size to fit on our pantry and holds a large bag of dog food.  Air tight which is noticeable even when the food gets towards the bottom.,1
"I was a bit skeptical of the belt because I had bought a similar one at Sam's that wouldn't actually stop the dog from pulling the leash out, but this one has a much better braking system on it and does stop him in his tracks.  It's a bit heavy, but it's worth it to be able to let the dog explore a bit more when we walk through trees and fields.  I am very satisfied and will buy a backup to keep in the car.",1
"Most of the pads were not sealed at the edges and the filling fell out. I didn't order seconds!
Pads were flimsy and non absorbent.",0
My dog loves these. I keep them in stock bc they are cheaper then the other pill pockets. Ill buy these always.,1
It works but the motor vibrates the plastic some which can create quite a loud buzzing noise. It started on a hardwood floor and quickly got moved to a rug to try to dampen the vibration.  It helped a little but is still too loud for me.,0
Easy to feed. My Guinea pigs love them,1
Cat stopped throwing up!,1
"Great price for a nice bed. It's not the most cushioned, as you can tell the filling is adequate (vs nicely overstuffed), but for the price and overall value, this is a nice choice. When I put it next to my Jax and Bones doggie bed, there's clearly no comparison, but the Jax and Bones one was also $100. So, if you want a very decent bed at a reasonable price, this is a great choice.",1
"This took FOREVER to get to me, but It works great!!!! I have 2 small dogs and can usually pick up a weeks worth of poo in one scoop.",1
"Very effective, my dog barked one time after I put the collar on her.",1
"Tubes are great, connector bands could be more durable.",1
These do a nice job of protecting your car seats from hair and scratches. Stay in place if you tuck a bit between the seat and back.,1
This product said that it was completely SAFE to use with plants.  I have 2 live plants in my tank that I have had for 3+ years and now they are turning brown and dying after I used this product. I followed the directions exactly. I am very disappointed with this algae control and deeply saddened that my poor plants are dying. DO NOT USE WITH LIVE PLANTS!,0
Good price.  My Vet has a hard time getting this but I did!,1
Water bottle and wheel do NOT work. Bought for our 2 gerbils. Large cage but not worth price if they can't drink or run on the wheel. Disappointed!,0

It was a WASTE of 5$!!",0
"I was rushing around for Christmas presents and didn't even realize it was a dog toy - LOL.  I thought it was a travel pillow and got it for my 'biker' Uncle.  Anyway, I do have a dog and my uncle enjoyed watching her play with it :).  It makes an awesome motorcycle noise.",1

Light is perfect for my 15 gallon column aquarium.  I read another review saying it was too bright so I thought it would be better if I glued it inside the original cover housing of the neon light the tank came with and it works great!!!,1

"Two of my cats were attacked and killed on my porch last month in the middle of the night, so I've been trying to keep all the others inside at night. Two of them, Doc and Miss Priss, are NOT adjusting well to their loss of nocturnal freedom, so I thought I'd try this. I gave it to both of them on their treats, 4-5 drops each, for two weeks. They continued to howl and pace around the house. Miss Priss did seem to fall asleep for about 45 minutes a couple of nights, but that was it. It may work for some cats, but did NOT work for mine. Of course, I even tried melatonin with my two, and that only had a marginal effect, as well.",0
"I like this style of canopy personally, but this particular one arrived with a scratch in the glass and the handle was completely smashed. Chose to return it.",0
I don't like the smell it leaves.,0
"A little lighter weight that many other single ply collars, so it slips around more and you might need to keep adjusting it.  It will also twist more than the heavier nylon collars.  But, it is a nice design that is has not worn off and looks like it will retain it's brightness.",1
"I bought this despite the horrible reviews regarding its toxicity for cats. I lightly sprayed the rug in my living room and them vacuumed after. I waited about 30 minutes before letting my cat back in the room just to be safe. When I went back into the room 10 minutes later, my cat was sitting on his cat tower in the room and excessively drooling all over himself. Never in his life have i seen him drool at all. Clearly, I should have taken the advice of all the people who said that this product made their cat sick. I can't even imagine how he would have reacted if I would have directly applied it to him. I cannot believe that this product has such good reviews or that it is even legal. So angry and frustrated that this product is claimed to be ""Vet's Best"" and ""Natural"". No vet in their right mind would recommend this product, it is not worth the risk of harming your animal.",0
Animals love it!,1
works good,1
"I got it's because of its good review, but it did not work on my dog. He got worse. I got it because his coat looked dull. I used it for 2 weeks . He started to get bumps and tried him out even more. Didn't work for us. It smells good tho",0
It does not hold up. It takes forever to get the air bubbles out. Looks real nice when done. But after 4 weeks it is bubblng awayfrom the glass. And peeling off the sides. Better off not using this.,0

I hate give a two star but my three dogs wouldn't eat them at all. They didn't like them but my mom's dog did. I really hate that mine didn't like them.,0
The gate broke after about 2 weeks. I am very disappointed. It is unfixable.,0
"My dog chokes on these.
I thought these would be safer, but still a hazard.",0
There something different about these than with the ones you would buy at a pet store or an actual known brand. They seemed baked like the skin on the leg has air bubbles baked. My dog didn't like them and ever since he tried one of these he wants nothing to do with a chicken foot from any brand since.,0
"I purchased this for a cat. The 24"" size is really too big for a cat, but the price along with the top door made it irresistible. I mean, a third of the price of a big box pet store! It works great and makes loading up a cat so much easier for the cat and me. Both of my dogs have Petmate crates and they've held up well. I've been very pleased with this brand over the years.",1
"These bowls are so perfect! They make clean up easy, the don't get soggy or leak, the fit perfectly inside my cats bowl, or I can use them alone with out a bowl. Cosima and Ava had no problem.

"My lab mix broke the buckle on the neck closure the first time she wore it. She didn't like the jacket but she needs it in the pond. We were playing water fetch and the neck wrap thing would confuse her and she was able to grab. She thought it was her fetch toy and pulled it until she broke it. It's plastic so that isn't hard to do. I wrote to the manufacturer and they wanted pictures so they could ""evaluate"" it. I'm sure I could have received a replacement if I had followed through. But that's why I HATE buying stuff online. I don't want to have a discussion about it just replace it. Lessons learned.
She was right on the borderline between M and L so I went with the large. It was probably too big which is why she was able to grab the neck part. However, it would probably be good if they improved the quality of the buckles these are dogs. It did float and had a great reflective stripe.",0
Birds love this!  Fast service.,1
"I use this box for several weeks now and cannot believe that I hesitated for so long. This is fabulous! And I paid full price plus tax in the brick and mortar! It is not cheaply made. It is plastic, but sturdy. Just make sure you align the top well before sliding the locking clips in place. If it is well aligned, there should be no leakage of litter whatsoever.

For cats with digestive issues use crystal litter - it will absorb moisture and leave even the most liquid deposits solid and ready to sieve. Every few days, after initial cleaning, I open the box and sort out any small particles of poop that were too small to be trapped. About twice a day I shake the box to help the crystals do their work, flip the box over any time I see any hard deposits and we are all very happy. The cats have it as clean as it can be, no offensive odor in the house and no dust.
Just use this box in combination with crystal litter

"Decent quality collar and I really like the reflective material that allows me to see my dog when she goes out in the yard at night.  The stitching is clean and no visible issues.  The buckle is the standard plastic one that most other collars have and hopefully it holds up for awhile.  I'd be more concerned if my dog like to pull on the leash more but no issue in my personal situation.  The biggest issue is that only the largest size collar comes in the 1"" width.  The medium sized collar is only available in 3/4"" width which looks too thin for my dog.  For reference, my female dog (mutt)  is about the size of a small lab but has a thicker neck.  Would have like to have the 1"" width like her previous collars.",1
"Installed in minutes, really like the black color, looks indestructible.",1
I just thought it wasn't for my domestic cats.  It's too big.  More for a lion or lioness.,0
"I got this for my 1 year old 65 lbs mutt. It's comfortable, fits nicely and she likes it fine. But she's not leash trained and this is what I got to train her. It does not distribute the weight of he pulling to her chest and shoulders, it chokes her when she pulls as if she had a regular collar on. I do not recommend this, I wish I  hadn't gotten it.",0
My two cats just love to snuggle and hang out in this cozy bed! A good product and the cover can be removed and washed which is a big plus!,1
"I bought three cat trees with my tax refund to help my cats be able to escape the toddler, be able to look out the window with out destroying my blinds & also for scratching post options. We have a very hyper probably 6lb 1+yr old cat and a grouchy 9lb 8 yr old cat. I put it in the corner& braced it in by tieing part of it to my end table which did help with stability.
 They absolutely loved this. The gymnastics that started to occur in my living room as the youngest cat would try to fly to the top without touching the floor or climbing any part of it was hilarious & she was bothering me a lot less in the middle of the night because she's be busy on this.
However after a little over a month of use, the middle hammock literally fell apart from the older cat sleeping there every day :(  Then a couple weeks later the top started to wobble & tilt no matter how we re-tightened it then it soon started falling over all the time no matter how we tried to brace it.
So now at 2.5 months it is laying on it's side. The cats still love it & now the toddler does too - it's kind of his obstacle course. I use the square base as a foot rest. When I remodel the living room in a couple months will explore the option of anchoring this to the wall by the window with l brackets or maybe take apart & mount the individual pieces independently with shelf brackets or something. The other two cat trees look bran new & this one is a pile of rubble... as I type the yuonger cat is popping her head out of the tube part :)  ....so if you get this be prepared to re-engineer it  handle the heavy use it will draw and make sure you put it next to the wall or in a corner where it's harder to fall.
I would not buy this again but due to the laughs we've gotten from it I don't totally regret it",0
Have a pit terrier mix and he cannot year these balls apart like other toys.  Worth the money for dogs that are hard on toys,1
This product probably would be fine IF it had been new. The harness I received was damaged so badly as to be unusable; one of the main straps is cut or chewed through 3/4 of the way in two places!  Product NOT new/unused! (although packaging appeared brand new ...hmmmm?),0
"not so good for a red eared-slider turtle, ok for lizards",0
I purchased this in September and have been very satisfied witt it ever since. It was delivered fast and in a normal flat box. Set up was a piece of cake and much easier then I anticipated for sure. It literally just came out and all you had to do was fold it out and pop a few things into place and you were good to go. It is also for sure sturdy and true to its size but yet spacious at the same time. It handled our second dog teething on the wire door and at least a 20 pound box sitting on it for a few weeks or so with no problems. This I will for sure be recommending to my family and friends. Also I will be purchasing one again when the time comes when I am in need of a 2nd one.,1
"My Kitty LOVES these toys! Very good quality, they don't fall apart like other toys I have bought.",1
"We love this cat food because it doesnt smell terrible. We were using the wellness brand which we also like, but it smells so bad it makes me gag. Love this product!",1
Delivered on time! Nice leash,1
Easy to put together but i received a used one that was dirty and had another animals haor all over it,0
I am taking this back!!!  My cats has been able to pull out the tray that the food goes into and the food ends up on the floor under the feeder. Like someone else said tap it and food comes out.,0
Collar does not work as stated.  Have a 16 lb dog and collar does pick up her barking very well.  Would not buy this brand again.,0
Works as expected.,1
"I ordered Large and it was soooo small!
Very cute but could not use",0
My dogs really liked these but they don't last long. They molded after just 2 weeks so I had to throw them away. It's a shame because they seemed to really enjoy them.,0
Great durable quality! I love that there are so many panels as you can make the enclosure as big or as small as you want!,1
I wish there were different speeds. My cat is so disinterested unless I take it and play with him with faster.,0
I would have given this product 5 stars because worked great for about 30 days. Then both the collar receivers stopped working and it is useless. I have tried contacting customer service but I can't get through to anyone. I am REALLY disappointed with this product.,0
"I don't know what else to say about this tag. My dog has two clips on her collar so this was nowhere near her leash, she wasn't playing hard, in fact she was sleeping on the bed when the tag fell apart. Don't waste your money.",0
The dogs face don't fit well in it.,0
arrived quickly.  Two cats that have both turned their noses up at various other fish-free foods love this one!,1
its ok,1
"Crocodile is an all-time favorite of dog! Many squeakers, lots of fun!",1
"I used this for cat urine----she pees on piles of laundry.  It did not remove the smell, even after 2 washings!",0
Still in one piece after almost 3 months and lots if tug o war games!,1
Doesn't fit the Tetra 36 in long 40 gallon breeder tank. It's about 1/8 of an inch too long,0
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PRODUCT FOR MY 2 YORKIES WITH ANXIETY!,1
"This play pen has worked fine for a year except for problems with the zipper on the door.  It has always been ""sticky"", but now it just won't zip at all which means, of course, that it's no longer usable.  Other than that, the pen has held up well.",0
Metal look on the bell broke through and it's only been 10 months. They cannot be re-attached,0
"My cat is picky but used to solid OTC cat food.  This stuff is soup.  Pookie gave it an immediate ""ON NO"" as she pranced away from the bowl.",0
none of my cats will eat it,0
"My lab puppy absolutely loves these! They are soft and chewy and spot-on for our training efforts. You can squeeze them in your hand and make them even smaller when you are doing repetitive training. I even asked our dog trainer what he recommends, and he told me these! We refuse to buy unhealthy treats for our puppy, and these fit the mold of exactly what we were looking for! Will buy again! AND they don't have an awful smell to them. They actually smell good! (But I do love cheese)",1
These bags are hard to separate.,0
My dog doesn't like them. What a waste of money.,0
"I add just a bit to their dry food for a bit of variety and they chow it down. I have a wheaten terrier and a terrier mix, who eat this with the Natural Balance dry food. I've been told wheatens are susceptible to gluten allergies so I feel better giving her the gluten free food just in case. Both dogs are healthy and active and neither has any trouble with this food.",1
Awesome! It works! This is the first review I have ever written and I'm writing it for whomever was as frustrated as we were!,1
"Now part of a class action lawsuit because their food contains metal,  and arsenic.  Discontinuing feeding my dog this food immediately.",0
works great,1
Cheap looking and flimsy not what I expexted,0
Our gentle lab LOVES this toy. The german shepherd shredded it,1
EXCELLENT TREATS FOR YOUR PET,1
"Very cute, looks great on my cat's new collar.",1
"This silica crystal is very fine. My cats tracks the crystal right out of the box. Moreover, it really doesn't absorb odor well. One bag lasted about a week before the odor got too unbearable.",0
My gecko lizard is happy!,1
"My Saint Bernard loves it. Very sturdy construction, great price and delivery. I recommend to anyone.",1
Would not recommend,0
"My boy loves the multiple squeakers - He takes them out one by one over several weeks, and is proud each time!  LOL - At least it last longer than most of his soft toys - I purchase a different one every few months",1
"Still trying to get our 7 yo, 65 lbs.  lab retriever comfortable in this to go for a bike ride, but the wagon is of very high quality and easy to set up, and easy to attach to our bike.",1
Our lab destroyed it in a few hours...though she played with the inner balls for a few weeks,0
"The price for these bully sticks is unbeatable.

The smell is a bit strong, but not horrid.  Always a great treat for dogs as these are 100% digestible.  They keep my dog busy and her teeth clean, she never gets sick of them.",1
I originally bought this for someone else's dog. The product was thinner than I thought but much much larger. Its made really well. Think soft ski wear. When I took it out to examine it my dog took to it immediately. We decided to use it when he was being boarded to stay comfy on top of his regular bed. He decided he was going to use it now...pulled it to his bed and lay down on it. It does keep him warm but he will choose an electric warmer over it if he's coming from outside.,1
"This is a good quality tag. It's pretty thick, so it's not like a cheap flimsy tag. It's very attractive also. I got the pink bone shaped tag. I liked being able to add so many lines of engraving, so we could put her name, and our phone number and address. We also added the word ""microchipped"" on the tag in case for some reason the person who finds my pet can't reach me. Next time we need a tag, I will be using this seller again.",1
They don't at as pellets or as a clumping litter. Just a smelly in between that fall apart. There are NOT a substitute for pellets!,0
All-in all. litter Genie is the best thing since clumping cat litter. I can't believe I ever lived without it. I subscribe and save every 4 months - so I never run out and I don't even have to think about it. Best. Thing. Ever.,1
Cute enough and he loved it but he destroyed it within minutes.,0
Do NOT buy size large as it is way too big.  I tried to adjust it but was unable to do so.  I had to cut through the collar and trim the plastic lighting element at least by 1 1/2 inches to get the strap to slide through the plastic buckle.  I then made the adjustment and had to use gorilla tape to seal the area where I had made the cut.  I did not feel like hassling with returning it and then have to buy size medium as I don't have the time or patience to run to UPS.,0
"These are great for our dog that loves fetch.  We just have to keep it stored away from our other dog that loves to chew them up.  We've gone through probably 6 or 7 in 4 years, worth it.",1
I bought this for my turtle and she loves it. It took her about 24 hours to know the contaner and now she swims right to the top of the tank when she sees it.,1
"It has been a lot of trouble finding a harness small enough to contain our 5 lb white hot ball of canine terror, but this has done the job. It is very sturdy and the little guy loves to join us on all our walks now.",1
My Ferals took this with no problem.  I believe it really helps them avoid flea infestation. I have not noticed any negative side effects.,1
Battery springs popped out,0
Good starter light but doesn't have the full spectrum of light for all corals. Also the programmer is on the frits after a couple weeks owning it. The daytime led will not turn off,0
"Starting my first tank, so just providing my experience as I still can not get a direct consensus on the use of this product with the API test kit.  After 7 days of ammonia testing, my results showed .25.  I then referenced the reviews stating the API does not read this product.  I decided to continue to add 4 drops to a 5 gallon tank everyday after skipping a few days waiting for results to post.  Thinking this would get me to 4-5ppm.  Starting testing for nitrites, assuming if the API does not read the ammonia, I simply was going to wait for the nitrites to read to see if the cycle was starting.  Nitrites at zero after 14 days.  I did more research to determine if I need to get another test to get an ammonia reading.  I came across this video which gives some tips on testing the water.

How to Use Water Test Kits - DrTim's Aquatics
http://youtu.be/ZPiDRid_Km8

Based on this video and other research, at 14 days, I made sure I tested the water at the bottom of the tank (I was taking water from the top).  The reading with the API test finally read very dark green - beyond 7.0.  At this point, I had been adding 4 drops a day for at least 5 days.

PH - tested PH level to ensure cycle had not stopped also, if it drops below 7.0, that means you have a bigger problem and might have to do a water change and start over.  PH was above 7.0 so I that was good.

Nitrites - still do not show.  I have read that there is no window on how long it will take to cycle, some citing a week, some citing a month, so I am hopeful now I will hold off on adding more ammonium to try to get to drop to the 4-5.0 level.  I have read mixed reviews on if ammonia spikes too high (above 8) that good bacteria can not live and you need to do a large water change.  Some cite to wait it out, so I am going this route for now.

Other helpful tips - I had a carbon filter (fluval), this might absorb some of the ammonia.  Removed it.
Heat - increased to 84 degrees.

Based on the above, I am not convinced the API test does not read this product.  If I would have been pulling water from the bottom, it might have been fine from the start.",1
"These are very thin (think grocery store produce bags), black bags which are great for small, neat messes (dogs under 30lbs with firm messes). Because these bags have very short sides, they are not appropriate for picking up large messes or messy messes of a medium size. The way you tie these closed creates opportunity for poop residue to get onto the exposed portions after tying and since they are black you may never notice. For medium-large dogs or situations where children will be picking up after the dog, I much prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bags-on-Board-Rainbow-Bag-Refill-Pack-120-Bags/dp/B001ZWHGFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bags on Board Rainbow Bag Refill Pack, 120 Bags</a>. These colored bags will show the contents which is disgusting, but the color contrast helps ensure you get a clean pick up and tie off. A thick-walled (for odor retention), black bag is always the most pleasant option for situations where you have to carry the full bag past other people.

I too notice there is no mention of these being biodegradable on the box. What's up with that?",1
"this is really hard plastic. not sure how safe it is for a dog, but our dog loved it - just had to take it away because we were concerned he would chip a tooth... hence the 2 stars... we decided that kongs are the better chew toys",0
Too difficult to adjust when you 're walking as the correction has to be immediate.,0
My dog really loves these and keeps him occupied too.,1
Great!,1
"The collar is so pretty.  I absolutely adored it when I first got it. It looked so cute on my cat. But, the knots that slide back and forth so as to fit the cats neck loosens after about a few weeks. Now the collar just falls off my cat. Had to throw it away.  sucks, too, because like I said the collar is super cute.",0

All the cookies came as promised.  We buy these up North and couldn't find them in Florida but there's always Amazon!",1
This is great for small dogs.  I have one in my house that my papillons stay in at night and when I'm not home.  I put together two of them and they stay in it in the front yard on a pretty day when I'm home.,1
I have been feeding my dog this brand since I adopted her (4 years) their ingredients are straight forward and grain free. The vet always comments on how nice her coat is and that she is perfect weight- they always say I must feed her well :),1
I used the chemi pure blue and after 10 days my tank was crystal clear but it lasted for 6weeks so then I order chemi pure elite and now I sorry I did my tank wasn't testing safe anymore and it's not clear ...so I'm going back to chemi pure blue,0

The fish loves it but I am afraid eventually it will get him sick.",0
"Overall, I think this is a good food and an absolutely amazing value as far as grain-free foods go.  My cat certainly enjoyed it, I saw an improvement in her fur, and she became leaner and more active.  On her prior diet of Science Diet Light (high carb, filler food - shame on me!) she was becoming fat and lethargic.  The difference in feeding a grain-free, high protein food was almost immediate.

My only problem with Taste of the Wild is that the amount of vegetables after the first ingredient (chicken meal) seems excessive.  Too many pea proteins and potato proteins.  The next meat ingredients, venison and salmon, don't appear until the sixth and seventh ingredient.  Recently I decided to switch my cat to Orijen, which I believe is the very best dry cat food out there - the first 6 ingredients are all meats!  Orijen, however, is also significantly more expensive.  For those who are on a budget, I think Taste of the Wild is far better than the vast majority of commercial dry kibbles out there.  Taste of the Wild is certainly better than the by-product and corn filler loaded (not to mention expensive) Science Diet that I fed my cat for the first 3 years of her life.",1
the dogs liked it alot.,1
The little spring loaded clasp broke after a few months. I felt it should have lasted much longer!,0
Terrible collar.  My dog somehow got out of the collar and ran into the middle of the street.  Almost killed himself and me running after him.  I'm done with this thing -straight in the garbage.,0
Provides support for lifting my dog into the car.,1
Okay,1

My dog loves this toy.,1
My friends dog loves these balls so I bought them for him.  My dog doesn't like the way they feel.,1
I read the reviews and was hesitant about buying it. I have a malti-poo (small dog) and the size and thickness was just right and it also fit perfectly in his crate. I've washed it a few times and so far it's held up.,1

"This are to thin and to small for a normal size litter box. There are just somethings you cant get based on the price. However, they were delivered on time and the product was intact. Just not what I needed.",0
i received a 'returned' fountain. the packaging was just shoved back in the box and i had no idea if this had been used by someone else and returned or who knows what they did with it. i didn't feel comfortable letting my cats drink out of it. very disappointing purchase.,0
"Wife loved it!  Very delicate, perfect to wear for special occasions!",1
"The light itself is fine but trying to turn the light on or off...  SUX BIG TIME!!!  It requires a stylus to push the button.  You CANNOT push it with you finger.  And then the instructions says something like to turn it on push and hold the button for 5 seconds.  5 seconds IF YOU ARE LUCKY!  And try doing that with the collar ON THE DOG.  Yeah, good luck with that.  Now what is even worse is that even though the instructions state that it takes like maybe 10 seconds to turn the light off, it literally can take 20-30 seconds to turn the light off!  ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME?!?!?  Yeah and you can forget about doing that with the collar on the dog.  THERE IS JUST NO FREAKIN' WAY TO TURN THE LIGHT OFF WITH THE COLLAR ON THE DOG!  So while you are using the stylus to try to turn the light off the light will go from constantly on to blinking to constantly on to off...  take the stylus off the button...  no wait...  the light is blinking again...  it didn't turn off... it cycled back to blinking...  ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME?!?!?  So start the 20-30 second process of trying to turn this stupid light off AGAIN!  I HATE THIS LIGHT!  I have thrown it down more than once in frustration trying to turn it off.  And I bought a shock collar from this same company.  Just like this light, the shock collar is water proof.  And it is not anywhere near this hard to turn the shock collar on / off.  I like the shock collar.  I would like to like this light as well.  But the difficulty in turning the freakin' light on and especially off will not allow me to like this stupid light.  If you waste you money on this light...  have fun with it...  as you have been warned.",0
"It was good for the first 5 months I owned it then it just stopped taking a charge. For whatever reason it will only charge about 15% now.  It was never dropped and only used it when traveling.

When it was working well, it would hold a good charge and it was nice to be able to charge 2 devices simultaneously.

I would have given it a higher rating had it lasted a full year; but 5 months is not acceptable.",0

I've used it on the carseat, the couch, and a mattress, mopping it up and manually drying the areas when I do.",1
Was really disappointed when I the crate arrived with no handle.  I needed this to crate my dog with stomach cancer at night (who had been vomiting and had diarrhea) and used it right away without realizing there was no handle.  Two days later when I needed to bring my dog to the vet I realized there was no handle so I checked the packaging and nothing.  Pretty disappointing.,0
Very stinky. We wouldn't purchase these again.,0
"Got the item very fast. Big problem though with the voltage on the bulb which is 110-120V not 230-250V.

Either it is not advertised correctly or maybe not investigated properly by myself.",0
"This collar came off in the woods when I was walking my dog with a harness.  Luckily, I found it.

"My cat drags her water bowl around the floor and spills water everywhere, so I was looking for a bowl heavy enough to stay put when she starts her antics. Amazon puts weight selections in the description, so I thought I was buying a 4 pound bowl. This bowl does NOT weigh four pounds. It HOLDS 64 ounces. Big difference. Thanks for the misleading description, Amazon. The top ring may have helped with the spillage problem, but the rubber ring absolutely would NOT stay on the bowl. So, this was was wasted money. Into the trash. Resuming search for a bowl that is too heavy to be muscled by my feline.",0
I have two Chihuahua mixes who love that security and comfort from being either underneath the covers or in a cave bed. I purchased this in hopes to provide more comfort for them. I was excited when the package was delivered to my door but to be quickly disappointed after opening it to see the size of the Igloo. My 12 lb. Chihuahua made an attempt to get into the Igloo but his shoulders stopped him from entering. My 6 lb. Chihuahua could barely get into it. She had to squeeze her whole body into the small opening. I also have a cat who tried and failed to get into the Igloo. It appears this was intended for toy dogs with very little comfort and very small cats. I love the design but very disappointed in the size.,0
Super annoyed with this product. I bought it intending to use it as part of a Halloween costume for my son and then giving it to my dog. It showed up today and is blue instead of white as I need for the costume. Why would the picture be of a white product,0
"NO HANDLE.  I received this.  Everything looked except.  it doesn't have handle that is in the picture.  I'm not the first one who complains about this.  I wish I had seen those review first.  The picture is misleading.  Without handle, it's a problem when it is filled up with seeds and heavy.",0
Really Good for Bull Terrier.,1
"First off, we didn't have splashing or spillage issues. No issues with the top, crescent-shaped portion slipping off, either. The sound of the bubbling water is a tad bothersome, but only because we can't escape it given that we live in a loft. My biggest complaint with the Raindrop is that the area where your cat drinks from isn't very large. If your cat is small to average size, then this probably won't be an issue for you. Our cat isn't small. I referred to her as ""zaftig"" in the title, but she's actually not that plump anymore. She's still a big cat, though (we think she's part Maine Coon). And I remember seeing online somewhere that cats don't like the edges of their food and water bowls to touch their whiskers. Apparently it's extremely annoying for them. So we purchased a big, white ceramic bowl -- probably about 13"" in diameter -- to use as her water bowl. And she drank happily from that bowl many times a day. I bought the Raindrop not with the intent on getting her to drink more, because that was never a problem, but because it looked cool, and I wanted to get her a Xmas gift. : ) But the Raindrop's opening is drastically smaller than what she had before, which resulted in her drinking less. So after two days -- yup, only two days of use -- I disconnected the Raindrop, and put back her old water bowl. More often than not, practical trumps cool.",0
"This removes cat vomit and hair balls.  BUT recently one cat was diagnosed with allergies and asthma.  He always lays on the carpet I have used this on. My other cat does not.  I got rid of the carpet because the Natures Miracle smell never seems to go away.  He has been in bronchodilators and steroids. And he has been doing great.  I spray some of this on a couch, and today he is exhibiting signs again.  I think this product is causing his allergies.  The ingredients are not fully disclosed.  Avoid if u dislike heavy scents.  I will never use it again.",0
My dog brings this to me when he wants a snack. We have had it for two yesrs now.,1
Exactly what I was looking for! Excited to for my pup to try (toy shih tzu). We are bringing her one this week. Didnt want puppy pads everywhere or a mess. We currently have carpet so I needed to set expectations quick. Confident this will help me. Put a puppy pad under for easy clean up,1
"I have an odd set up at the bottom of my stairs and had trouble finding a baby gate for that space. (There is a wall on one side, a spindly banister down the other, and the bottom stair extends beyond the wall.) After MUCH searching I purchased this KidCo pressure-mounted gate plus the Y-spindle attachment, and installed it on the first stair, instead of on the ground. It was the perfect solution! The gate says it fits spaces up to 37 inches using the enclosed extensions, but I found that I was still able to use it in my space, which was actually 37.5 inches. (UPDATE: Because my space is 1/2 inch wider than the widest setting on this gate, the latch on the gate does not latch properly. I can still close it thanks to the prongs that hold the gate door across the bottom bar, and just lift the whole swinging door part. My now 20-month-old still has not figured out how to open the gate on his own.) The gate looks nice - my in-laws didn't even notice it at the bottom of the stairs, despite my staircase being right inside the entrance to our house. My 9-month-old is just beginning to pull himself up, and has given the gate a good shake a few times. It remains steadily in place. Added bonus: It keeps my dog downstairs too. I refrained from giving this gate 5 stars only because the handle is a little hard to use with just one hand (you have to press a button in the front and the back at the same time, lift the handle, and also lift the gate door a little). However, it is very likely I will purchase a second one to use in the doorway of my son's room.",1
"My cat developed antibiotic-related diarrhea, and I quickly ordered these chews as I figured chews would be much easier to get my cat to eat than a powder. My cat does love these chews, but after finishing off the whole bag, he still had no change in stools. Fed up, I bought one of the powders from a well known, vet recommended brand, even though I do not like their products, because I figured that would would be the best chance of getting live cultures. After one packet of that powder, my cat's stools are back to normal. Clearly these chews have no benefit as far as probiotics go. However, they do have prebiotics and digestive enzymes as well, and I can't speak to how effective those are.",0

"Ouch.....sorry....I'm not willing to poison my dog with canola oil.

It comes from the rapeseed plant.....it was genetically modified in 1995 by Monsanto to
tone down the unpleasant taste.  Doused with Roundup.

It's banned in Europe.

Known to cause heart lesions.

I could keep going, but, if you want to feed that to your dog....go ahead.

Added information about canola oil from Natural News:

Canola oil comes from highly toxic genetically modified rapeseeds. In the past, rapeseed oil was used in candles, soaps, lipsticks, lubricants, inks, biofuels, and even insecticides. Somehow this industrial oil found its way to our dinner table.

In 1956, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of rapeseed oil for human consumption due to the high levels of erucic acid. By the early seventies, rapeseed growers had found a way to genetically modify the seeds to produce an oil with reduced erucic acid.

The oil was reintroduced on the market under the name ""Rape Oil"" or ""LEAR Oil"" (Low Erucic Acid Rape), which was later changed to canola oil for marketing purposes. It was touted a wonder oil, low in unhealthy saturated fats and high in healthy omega-3 fatty acids.

While this GMO seed may have a lower erucic acid content, hybridization and genetic modification also increased the amount of oleic acid. Oleic acid has been linked to stunted growth, abnormalities in blood platelets, free radical damage, and an increased risk of several types of cancer.",0

"It does not work. I have 3 dogs a pit bull, jack russell, and a Maltese.  they bark in the house and I have high ceilings and it echoes so bad,.  i thought for sure this would work, I was praying it would work, but they still continue to bark with no hesitition..",0
I think this has been good for my cat.  Slows her down a little and makes her work.  She figured it out pretty quickly!,1
"I recently purchased this item as a Christmas present for my 28 lb Cocker Spaniel as was very disappointed.  Why the fabric is a decent quality the padding is almost non-existent.  My dog like to sleep like the Lab in the picture but the padding in the donut part again is so soft and of little his chin sits in the ground.  The picture is very deceiving and makes the bed look a lot nicer than it really is. I purchased the bed because the company's track record however I emailed them about returning the product a week ago (12/29) and no response.  There price was only $5 cheaper than similar beds from Lands End, Ovris, LL Bean, or Dr. Foster and Smith. I have since replaced his bed with a much nicer one from one of the company's listed above.  Bottom line don't waste your money.",0
"Very happy with this treat jar, it's cute, it has a seal for the lid!  Just the right size for a little box of milkbone marrow treats.",1

I have two cats that both refuse to eat this. When I ignored them for one day over the food they ate it... and threw up on my coffee table.,0
I have used many different companies in the past for my soft claws and this one falls off almost immediately with their glue and with left overs from different companies. Within two days every single one fell off.,0

I ordered Prozyme for my Greyhound because I read on various veterinary websites that this product would help with gas as well as prevent my dog from eating her stool. I received the product and used as directed and my dog wound touch her food when this product was on it so I feel it was a waste of money.,0
this is the most beautiful urn and is perfect size for my two little pom. dogs ashes i am crazy about my fur babies final resting place,1
This didn't work for me.  It pulled my dog's hair too much and hurt him.  It would probably work for some people.,0
I went thru 3 of these in about 4 months and then bought a bigger one.  Even the bigger one doesn't last.  The mechanism inside that stops the leash when you push the button cuts thru the leash over and over til it makes the leash unusable and the company doesn't allow you to return them for a new one.  Don't waste time or money with Flexi.,0
I have heard several stories where dogs tried to get food out and got their tongues stuck and suffocated.,0
Given as a gift. Was received promptly and the receiver loved this item. I highly recommend this item for use on cats.,1

"Product seems well made, however, it does not fit most american toilet seats!  It did not fit my toilet seat so I went to Home Depot to purchase a new toilet seat and tried it on every single one in the store and it did not fit a single one.  I ended up buying a cheap toilet seat and using a jigsaw to widen the seat.

The company appears to be Australian, so I imagine that it might be set up to fit toilet their toilet seats.  So be warned!  Seems like a good product, but you will likely need to make some modifications.",0
Didn't last anytime at all and my dogs made a mess tearing them up.,0
"Does very well on my thick haired blue healer. Only drawback, if it really is one, is that you need to keep the blades oiled even during mid cut.",1

"I've been very disappointed with the Kurgo Hammock.  I have a Mazda 3 and it fit's perfectly, and protects all the seat surfaces well from a wet 60lb lab.  The issue is with the materials used/construction.  This was my third Kurgo hammock in less than a year that has torn just above the Velcro opening in the center.  One of the others tore just above the Velcro opening on the side.  I've brought all three of the torn hammocks to a seamstress, who fixed and reinforced the area, only to have all of them tear again above that.  With very little intermittent weekend use, the grommets started to separate from the material on all of them.  I've been very careful to fit the hammock so that there is plenty of slack so that the seat under the material is supporting the weight of the dog, rather than the material.

My lab is pretty sedentary in vehicles so they haven't been destroyed by hyperactivity, but in my experience, it can't handle heavier dogs.  If you have a much lighter dog, I think that this item could work for you.  On the plus side, I never had any strong smells for the material that others have noted.

I should have stopped trying to make this work after the second one, but I like the look and fit and really wanted to make it work.  Oh well.

*This is my experience with it, others have had great experiences, your mileage may vary.",0
We get an abundance of birds year round in our yard. This is the feeder they all flock to. Well worth it.,1
"This produce only seems to work when I'm ten feet from the dog. When he starts chasing a car, it's useless. Three hundred yards, my a$$!",0
Too small despite it's measured sizing. Disappointing.,0
Bought this for my cat hoping it would be more comfortable than a cone. It worked great for a couple of days until it deflated when i wasn't home one day and my cat tore her stitches open. I would NOT recommend this product at all.  Very poor design considering animals have claws that can easily puncture the innertube.,0
"We have purchased this cat tree twice.  The first version, purchased in January 2010 was great and the cat's loved it. Very sturdy.  They literally wore it out.  So we just purchased another and it is NOT made the way the first one was.  It is not nearly as sturdy, the posts are narrower and the platforms are thinner.  We haven't had it up a week and the pile is already coming apart.  When one cat jumps off the whole thing shakes.  I will not be buying another product from this manufacturer again.  No problem with the seller.  It was delivered fast, but the item is a piece of CRAP!",0
Very loud I had to return it.,0
I filled the water to the fill line and it leaks.  BTW the seal was fine.  When I put it down and the water went into the bowl it did come out.  When I picked it up to move it to the back of the car the water didn't go back into the bottle but spilled out of the bowl.  I tried filling it below the water line and the same thing happened.  What a waste of money.,0
"Ended up throwing it away, as it seemed it was welded shut.  Couldn't open it.  I now buy locally.",0
My dog loves this however he has had it for 2 minutes and it's started to chip already!,0
"I have 2 rowdy shelties, they love to pull. After reading the instructions I put it on my dogs, I walked one and my son walked the other.  It seemed OK at first but as the walk progressed and my pups got more excited they just choked themselves. The leash would get tight around the belly and pull at the collar. They where hard to manage because dogs are led by their heads not their middles. It did make a good leash after the plastic handle was removed. .",0
good for the 4th of July,1
Well made-reasonably priced-a bit smaller than I expected.,1
i got this on discount and would recamend this to anybody who has an anamial,1
"This collar was total junk, the first time I put it on my dog, it tore and the light unit came out. WOULD NOT RECOMMWND!",0
It lasted three days before snapping. I had to purchase a sturdier leash.,0
"From the description I thought this was one of the toys with the voice box, which my dogs love.  Instead, this has a strange noise maker that only makes a sound when the toy is shaken up and down vertically, not squeezed, an action the dogs rarely make when playing.  Additionally, this was torn apart very quickly compared to other dog toys.  I would not recommend.",0
"my dog loves the taste! he thinks he is getting a treat. he is still a puppy though, so it remains to be seen how the product will help him.",1
"They can have this one star. I ordered two for my dog babies. The large fits my Buddy Love perfectly.  It's beautifully made. I don't like that there is no  button hole opening to attach a leash to his harness. I took it to have one sewn in.

My other baby, Oh Mickey You So Fine (Mickey to his friends ), his was too small. I also ordered two by mistake. Requested return, was sent authorization.  After spending just under $25 to return these jackets, STILL WAITING for refund!!!! Contacted company, only to be told they haven't received anything!! It's been a month.....",0
"Very cheaply made.  The collar is made more out of fabric and I do not see how it could last very long.

It does serve the purpose of having a small light.  The light is not secure in the collar and can fall out.  Overall I am very disappointed in my purchase.",0
"I overnighted this bc my Great Dane just had surgery and needed it quickly before I left for thanksgiving. He's had it on for 15 minutes then began to bite it and pull. Now is running around with it in his mouth. I paid 29-30 bucks for a new chew toy... my puppy isn't even a big 'licker'.  It's almost like having this on made it worse, his skin is red and inflamed from more biting and licking than he was before I put it on!!! I will be asking for a full refund.",0
"This is a cheaply made tiny ""blanket"".  It arrived in a plastic envelope and felt squishy from the outside.  When I opened, the blanket was dripping wet. When squeased, a brown liquid came out of it.  I through it in the trash.",0

I didn't notice a difference in my nursing dog at all.,0
"The bed disappointed me, but more importantly, it disappointed my dog.  He ended up sleeping on the hardware floor next to the bed.  When my dog (a 6 1/2 pound Chi) tried to get in it, it flopped over on him.  When I first placed him in it, he was content.  But then he tried to get up and resettle himself, the bed flopped in on him, and he got out.  Then he couldn't get back into the bed becasue it would flip over on its side.  He tried all sorts of maneuvers, then gave up and laid down on the floor.  The bed that I received does not sit flat on the floor as shown.  It's rounded and causes the bed to be unstable.  I'm not sure if mine is defective, but I read one other reviewer who said the bed flopped in on his dog.  I've thrown out the box already and hate the chore of returning things.  I'll take it to the shelter this weekend and donate it.  I think it will be good for a cat, not a dog.",0
"I have a large blood red parrot fish and she cannot eat these medium pellets. The poor thing, she cannot even get them in her mouth. I would suggest getting the small size, no matter the size of your fish.",0
awful product that does terrible job.  waste of money.,0

Worked great to contro' my over barking issues. I'm now able to walk my dogs or have the inside door open without all the barking.,1
"Our bullmastiff mix puppy just turned one year, and she has enjoyed playing tug or fletching the big red ball through the winter months. We decided to use the toy as one we play with her, not for solitary chewing or mauling. Our strategy has worked: she loves playing, and the ball remains in one piece. I highly recommend the Kong Jumbler Ball for big puppies who enjoy playing ball with their family members.",1

She's a sweet loving protective very smart little lady.",1
"I've gone through atleast 6 of these with my puppy, first I thought she was breaking them but I saw it for my self without her in the kennel moments after I had put it together the connecting pieces cracked and the bowl fell and I had to throw it out yet again, I tried not having it as tight and I tried it as tight and I could get it either way each bowl broke in the same spot every time. Will not buy it again, given enough chances. Don't buy it!",0
"Great slicker brush for the price. When you press to release the hair it can still get a bit scratchy, I wish the bristles went down just a bit further. But for removing hair from your cat this is a good tool. Seems safe for their skin also. I like to furminate, but only once a month since it's a more harsh tool. I use a slicker and a flea comb for weekly brushings.",1
Our dogs absolutely loved these Bully Sticks and they were at a more reasonable price per stick than we could find at our local pet stores.  Thank you for a great product as we are no longer giving our dogs rawhide to chew on.,1

That, however, was the the extent to which the unit performed as expected.
As a test, I set the portion amount to ""01"" and the result was a single piece of kibble dropping into the bowl. Obviously not enough. Next I set it to ""02"".  The result of that was a series of very loud convulsions of the machine and 1 cup (250ml) slowly filling up the bowl. After roughly two minutes of the loud, strained convulsions the motor finally stopped. But there was way too much food for a single serving.
I then removed the batteries for about 10 minutes, to try a reprogram. The results were the same. I even reprogrammed a 3rd time. Same disappointing result. (see video)
To be thorough I then called Cat Mate phone support, but they could not offer a solution, however they suggested I pay the shipping to return it back to them. I politely declined, and initiated a return via Amazon.",0

"We bought this to help with cutting down food for one cat while not affecting the second cat.  We started with larger openings and worked up to smaller openings (harder for him to get the food out).  He has learned not to push it into a corner or under furniture.  It does slow him down on the his eating and he has lost a little weight.  The other cat is not interested in it, so leaves it alone.  We fill it with his food when we leave the house and at night and it helps leave the other food for the second cat.",1

"From Cichlids to Fancy Goldfish I've been keeping fish for 30+ years. Just about every major manufacture and boutique specialty company has a water conditioning and treatment product. I can't say I've tried them all, but close too it. Some products have at the least, minimal effectiveness while others can be potentially dangerous.

An example would be Stress Coat which has binding sugar strands in the Aloe. This isn't a problem unless one of your fish has a small scratch or wound. The sugar feeds the bacteria which can lead to major infection and dire consequences. I've been using Amquel for years and it's a fine conditioner, excellent at removing chlorine, and Chloramines, but like all these products - they come with limitations.

Well, with one exception and that's Prime by Seachem.

A few months ago, I decided to give it a try, and haven't looked back since. Prime doesn't just remove the chlorine and Chloramine it does much more:

* Detoxifies any and all heavy metals in your tap water

(you can call your water company directly for a list of them and PPM)

* Neutralizes Ammonia

* Neutralizes Nitrite

* Neutralizes high Nitrate to non toxic levels

* Removes toxic gases

* Will not foam or change PH

* Helps regenerate natural slime coat

Since using Prime, I've seen a dramatic improvement in all of my fish. In 2010 one of tanks was hit with the dreaded and rare Toxic Tank Syndrome -  within 48 hours I had lost nine gorgeous fish - except for one survivor, a single Broad Tail Nymph. Since that ordeal, ""Roxy"" became a bottom dweller spending most of her time laying in a corner. Treatments were conservative, but nothing worked.

After my first 50% water change using Prime her behavior began to improve. Now she swims among her tank mates, her color is better, gill movement stabilized and her appetite ferocious. In fact I see improvements in all my fish and in every tank. There simply isn't anything like it, Prime is hands down one of the best things you can do for your fish.

In addition to the outstanding, patented formula of Prime - it couldn't be more economical to use. A single 500 ml bottle treats up to a whopping 5,000 gallons of water. A tiny bit goes a long, long way. It should also be noted that in times of emergency the dose can be increased five times, Prime is harmless to fish. It's the only product of it's kind, and towers above any other water treatment on the market - period.

If your an aquarium hobbyist be it novice or advanced -  I would urge you to add a bottle of Prime to your arsenal of fish care products. Your finned friends will thank you for it.",1

"Been feeding my dogs Blue Buffalo for several years.  But always have to make a special trip to get it.  Since Nutrish  was available when grocery shopping and the cover stated no by products, meal, or wheat gluten, etc.... I decided to give it a try. The price was not much different than the Blue I was buying, but I thought it would be more convenient. I gradually started mixing in the Nutrish with the Blue to make the change. I have been through 2 bags of the Nutrish now...due to the change in my dogs stools (I have six) and the increase in gas I am seeing, I am going back to Blue Buffalo.",0
"I don't normally leave product reviews, but this resin tree root is unbelievable. Truly lifelike. I got the small size version for my Sanchezi Piranha in a 10 gallon. It sticks out at the top by a 1/4"" but it isn't a problem if you have a glass hood. Also, it was packaged and protected very well. It arrived with no damage at all; no breakage or chipping. Highly recommended.",1
"I actually bought this directly from their website. I think the concept is good, but it really needs to be attractive to cats and work the first time around, I really don't need to ""stick with it"" like the company owner describes. My litter box was in the same backroom where I tried it and my cat went there one time (gave it an honest effort) and apparently wasn't thrilled with experience. If the cat does not want to go into this thing, there is nothing that would make him and after a couple of times your cat goes some place else, you will pretty much hate the whole idea. Besides, it has major flaws with it that I list below, so REALLY before you give it a try.
My personal experience:
1. You will not be able to lift the toilet seat - this will be your cat's toilet for a very long while.
2. It actually creates more mess than the litter box - it's not deep enough so you end up with a lot of litter (and other stuff) all around the toilet.
3. Does not fit my toilet (despite the owner's claim that it fits 100% of toilets in the US). My toilet is NOT a custom-made toilet and came with the house built in 1992.
4. Does not attach to my toilet ring either (see above).
5. The smallest middle hole is elevated - how is the cat supposed to use it? Lift his poo up and throw it in there? :)
6. There is no good reason for the ""special"" litter that they sell (rather than making extra money).
7. Poorly written manual - from stylistic standpoint to spelling and grammar errors, feels very ""cheaply"" put together.
Therefore, I went back to the litter box and my cat sincerely thanked me for it.",0

"BUYER BEWARE!  Pretty sure my English Bulldog passed away due to this product just a few days ago!  Some kind of reaction from this product as reaction started immediately after applying!  Heavy breathing, to foaming from the mouth(MENTIONED ALSO ON OTHER REVIEWS I AM NOW NOTICING!!!) to gasping for air till we washed it off thoroughly...long story short, that was in the last week of July when we nearly lost her, when we initially used the product...till recently we weren't as fortunate.  I had a friend of mine keep an eye on my dog just the other day as I was going to be out of town over night. She happened to grab the very mat from my garage that was in the bottom of her kennel that I had not used since my dog was having the initial incedent when these wipes were used.  Keep in mind she hadn't been in on this mat nor the kennel since the last incident just a Lil over a month ago, and I am assuming (won't know till hear from toxology) that this product that I believe caused the last incident was still on this mat as the product goes on heavy as they are saturated wipes, and was probably left all over this mat.  Unfortunately I was not around to deal with the situation, and my Bulldog is no longer with us!!!  As mentioned in numerous reviews I now notice....other pepole are mentioning the main ingredient Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is by all means NOT NATURAL..& CAN BE TOXIC!  Forgive me for my rabbling post but as you can imagine I am very distraught with this whole situation and my loss!!!!  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!  FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!  NOT HAPPY! !!",0

She also believes cut down on their itching.  I bought it but I really can't get past the strong smell.  If it gets on your hands, forget it.  I didn't like the thick, yellow, gooey liquid.  My cats really didn't like it.  If I put on their food, even being salmon oil, would hardly eat their food.  Her cat and dog gobble it up.  It's all subjective.  I stuck using the large bottle but half way through, I gave it to her and bought an oil with high Omega concentration comprised of anchovy and sardine oil.",0
"I never write reviews on anything, but this product definitely deserves one. My cat has always been very picky about her water source, rejecting standard sized cat bowls and wanting nothing to do with the large mixing bowls of water I would offer her. I changed out the water in the bowl every day but she still felt that wasn't good enough, I guess. It got to the point where she would ONLY drink water out of the bathtub. She would cry until I turned it on and then she would drink the running or fresh pooled water. I finally got this Drinkwell and she LOVES it! It has a quiet hum to the motor that I can barely hear (it's about 6-7 feet away from my bed) and the sound of the ""waterfall"" part of the fountain is actually very soothing to me. My cat hasn't begged for bathtub water since I set up her Drinkwell, plus she loves to stick her head under the falling water. It has NOT leaked and works perfectly as described. The only water that is ever on the floor around it is from my own clumsiness from spilling water while refilling the reservoir. The reservoir really adds to the product and helps me make sure the water level doesn't get too low; the instructions state that if it goes below a certain water level, the motor may stop functioning properly.

All in all, great product. I have a happy, hydrated cat and the nice sound of a little fountain in my bathroom.",1

"In past years I was able to buy chew hooves at Petsmart.  They smelled awful, but actually cleaned the tarter from my dogs' teeth.

When I found these chew hooves I had hoped for the same result and have been extremely disappointed in them.  They shatter and splinter causing a health hazard for my dogs.

my cats are not fans,0
Are you kidding me????? This is a medium? Seriously this fits a Chihuahua. Not a medium sized dog. Absolutely ridiculius,0
"I have an 11 year old lab mix who was having trouble getting up steps and whining at night due to pain (we think). After giving this to our dog for over a month we see a difference in the way he moves...just yesterday he bounded through the house like he was a puppy! He loves the taste; he thinks they're treats. He seems to be sleeping through the night, too, with less whining.",1
our cat wouldn't touch her food whenever we added this. although there was no noticeable odor to the laxaire our one cat would always know it was in her food without even eating it.,0
Pretty good,1
they are tiny!,0
The edge is much too hard compared to others. Didnt look very durable. Sent it back,0
"Very nice collar, accurate & exactly as requested, arrived sooner than promised  A+, highly recommend.",1
cat wouldn't eat it .......its a pill,0
Be sure and measure your dogs girth. I got the harness opened it up and it wouldn't fit around my dog. And there was no way to return it after opening the package. It's a great idea and I was excited to get it but disappointed that it did not fit.,0
Did not hold up to medium sized dog who likes to chew. :(,0
"Not only is this fun, but it's educational.  If you have a burning sense of curiosity about your rescue dogs like I did, this is the perfect product.  First though, if you have a puppy, be warned it's a bit harder to get the DNA sample than an older dog.  Our older rescue was patient as I swabbed her mouth - the puppy tried to eat the swabs. Besides that though, this is a great product.  You swab your dogs mouth, put it back in the package, mail it back (postage included!) and wait.  It took about two weeks turn around time before we knew what each of our dogs were.  Not only do you get the DNA profiling but you get information about your dog's breed(s) and what to expect and things you can do to take care of your dogs.  We really enjoyed learning more and it's really fun to be able to tell people what your dog is.  We knew our puppy was part cattle dog, but the look on people's faces when we add that she's also part German Shepherd and Cocker Spaniel is pretty great.  I highly recommend this product.",1
Thought this would be a good idea for my dog that is crated during the day - couldn't have been more wrong.  He would have made less of a mess if I put his regular bowl in with him.  This just ended up dripping all over his bed in the crate and then he lapped up the water from the bed itself.  I will be returning this.,0
Love it!,1
"It's carpeted with regular carpet that would be used in a house so I wouldn't use it outside as someone asked.  It's very sturdy.  We have large cats, two of them are Maine Coons and it works well for them.  Sometimes all three of them sit on it at the same time looking out the window.  We put ours on hinge brackets (didn't use the ones that came with it) so we can fold it down under the window if we need to.  (Folding Shelf Bracket Sp1794 12in X 12in Sold In Pairs).  Works well.  The cats use it often.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extra-Large-Padded-Cat-Window-Perch-Color-NATURAL-Size-EXTRA-LARGE-PERCH/dp/B000PGAS92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extra Large Padded Cat Window Perch : Color NATURAL : Size EXTRA LARGE PERCH</a>",1

"Although they are a bit messy, our furbabies love these treats!",1
"These last about 2 weeks max in our house. My dogs aren't huge chewers, but when I stuff them with treats like they are suppose to be used they chew the top off in a few days. I used them while my dog was on crate rest and ended up buying new ones once or twice a week. I think the best one lasted 2 weeks.",0
Didn't help my cat at all.,0
"This stuff is amazing! Works wonderfully when used properly. I have 3 dogs that had a flea infestation and within a few days, along with other flea preventative, completely flea and tick free. These products also smell amazing!",1
"It works but makes a lot of noise. You can't put it near a room, it has to be outdoors",0
Very cool,1
Bought this for my daughter to help keep the ants out and the smell in. Does it's job beautifully!,1
It came compressed and shrink wrapped. Opened it and let it expand. I was quite surprised that it had as much support as it does. Cover looks very durable and best of all my great dane loves it! He spends a lot of time sleeping on it.,1
Great dog food for a great price,1
The directions are terrible. Putting it together was terrible. Ended up having to make my own screw holes since the holes that were already there do NOT match up. There are gaps in the wood which would be easy for a small animal to get their foot caught in. I must not have paid enough attention to the dimensions since this is EXTREMELY small and is not even big enough for 1 Guinea pig. Definitely do not recommend buying. It was a huge waste of my time and money.,0
"I now have 2 of these litter boxes.  I have 3 cats, 1 Rag Doll and 2 Bengals.  The Rag Doll is a very large cat so I was worried about it being large enough and it is.  The inside is very slippery texture so it stays clean looking and is easy to clean.  The powdery dust that comes off litter makes the sides look dirty on my other litter boxes, but not this one, it shines and looks clean all the time.",1
"I was surprised to see that this harness advertises that it's a non-choking harness. The front of the harness, beneath the neck
does hit the dog just at the right spot to cause the choking.  If you have a little dog that does not pull, then this would probably
work for you.  But, I've got a six-pounder that does and this is a terrible product for a small puller!",0
Oh phooey.  My guy turns out to be one of the dogs who can't eat a single one of these without barfing.  Only he waits till after the next meal...the Dentastix obviously keeps that next meal from digesting and up it comes.  It happened twice with a pause in between as a test.  Throwing them out.,0
Highly doubt this is Kong material. My dog had one chewed to bits in under 3 hours. Not worth the money.,0
Super simple instructions and my dogs were obsessed with it! Will purchase again!,1
Good Product and quality,1
Love it,0
My dog liked it a lot.,1
First time we used it the rubber tip post that sends the signal fell off. We continued to use it occasionally the it quit altogether after a couple of months. We have requested a refund from the server two times and haven't heard from them at all. This was the 2nd training collar we have used and the one from a different company lasted a couple of years with a lot of use. We since have purchased another collar from another company and are very happy with it.,0
"New recipe in can re-labeled classic pate. The new can (with the same UPC) appears to be just another subtle cosmetic change but the ingredients have definitely changed. My cats love the beef feast, but none will eat more than a nibble of this new recipe.",0
"My finicky PITA cat refused to eat these. Dramatically licked the treat and went into this convulsion-like routine as if she was going to vom. Meanwhile, my mom's cats pushed them off the counter, ate through the bag, and consumed multiple treats while she was out!",0
Works good,1
Fabric is too rough,0
"Hey, I realize this is a niche purchase, but an incredible bargain if you have young cats like I do.",1
It's not working for us. I put them on the collars of our two cats and they have gotten fleas anyway and are scratching a lot. I've seen a lot of fleas on the younger cat. I don't know what to do. Our older cat reacted to spot-on Advantage last year and I don't want to give him spot-on treatments anymore.,0
"The item appears to be working. My water, after initially looking a bit cloudy once I used the item, cleared up overnight and the water is now crystal clear. My fish look happier, too; they are swimming around a lot more and look livelier. I have a flat, not round filter. I simply carefully cut the four packs into single packets and put two in my filter. The reading of nitrate dropped dramatically.",1
Wayyy too small for my dogs... I ordered a medium and an xl for both of my dogs and the the dimensions weren't accurate,0
"This is a grooming muzzle, not a total-bite prevention muzzle. It goes behind the dogs ears instead of around the neck. I may sew on a small piece of webbing to the under-chin portion to put around the neck, as any intelligent dog can slip this off with one good paw-swipe. That said, you should introduce a muzzle to your dog slowly, over a period of days, and if you do it correctly you shouldn't have a problem.

I debated what size to order---this one was ordered for a 50lb Springer, who measures 8.5 inches around the end of his muzzle by his nose, as per the instructions. I went ahead and purchased this one, thinking too big was better than too small. I have to tighten the head strap as tight as it will go, and significantly decrease the muzzle circumference setting as well or it just hangs off him. It is also too large at the rear of the muzzle near the neck, but that's not too much of a big deal. I knew he wasn't an XL dog, but the instructions say to measure the muzzle.

It would probably fit my 66lb Golden Retriever perfectly.",1
The seller obviously never checked this product. It is WAY TOO BIG (even though it says small) for either of my terriers who are 9lb and 15 lbs and different breeds. The materials used are toxic smelling and rough to the hand and the padding makes the collar incapable of being adjusted because you can't punch new holes without breaking tools. I had to pay for this and delivery and will not pay additional fees to send it back - it is rubbish that is poorly made - don't buy it.,0
"We currently have three different cat trees in our house, and this one is by far our favorite once it was all set up.  That being said, this thing can be a huge pain to try to set up, as the instructions are pretty much non-existent, and the different pieces are not labeled at all.  The instructional video we found on Youtube for putting this together mentioned by previous reviewers was actually for a different version of the tree, and has different sized parts that did not correspond appropriately.  In addition to the troubles putting the item together we also discovered upon coming to the very top bedroom portion that our package was actually missing the three small board pieces that make up the steps to the top perch.  Given that we spent a couple hours putting this thing together we were really not particularly happy with the idea of taking everything apart and trying to miraculously fit everything back into the original packaging to return it for a replacement item.  We ultimately decided to just keep the item rather than go through all that hassle, but it is a real bummer to have an incomplete cat tree.  At least the cats enjoy it.",1
"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.",0
Great pet feeder.  Very happy with the purchase and quality - my 20lb small-medium dog uses it without problems and it looks great.,1
This works great across the seats and connected to the Guardian Steel Barrirs.,1
"Works great and is definitely effective, however the collar broke after about a month of use. I bought one for each of my dogs and am hoping that this was simply a defective collar. The second collar does not show any signs of wear.",1
What I received was not Nitra-Zorb but another filter... I did not realize until after I had opened it. I paid for rush same day shipping and did not get the urgent help I needed with a filter to reduce nitrates.,0
Doesn't work. Have to return. Same thing happened to a friend who ordered one.,0
The bottom line... it doesn't work.  I would have done better throwing the thing at my dogs to get them to stop barking.  I've got two dachshunds that are too small for shock collars so sonic deterrents are the only thing safe.  This is definitely a try it at your own risk item.  Thankfully Amazon priced it better than local stores ($99.99) so it wasn't a big loss.,0
Lasted about two weeks.,0
Love it,1
"bought this as better for my dog,then found it listed on WORST 15 dog foods in 2016",0
Dog loves it. Super easy to clean. I'm sold.,1
Worked at first but now the light won't turn on or off. Can I get it replaced?,0
I tried this for my chihuahua. Every time he shook it caused the alarm to sound. Obviously that is not going to help solve a barking problem. It will just make him scared to move. Took it off and will solve the problem with a different method.,0
Terrible product. 9 Month old lab ripped it open on the first day.,0
My picky dogs love it,1
"Did not fit around my dogs neck, buy a size larger than you think you need.",0
Our cats don't like them as well as Greenies but they do finally eat them.,1
"My dog (Golden/Lab Retriever) loved the taste of this food.  I heard this food is one of the top food/healthy food to give your pet.  After 1 day, he  started having poop issues, diarrhea all night long. Initially, I thought his poop problem was from other sources.  I started feeding him rice and chicken and the problem went it away after a day or two. So I started feeding him Wellness again, and again, poop problem.  I still thought it was coming from other sources.  But anyway, after the third round of poop problem, we know it's for sure the food.  It seems great for other folks, but for some reason, not my golden/lab.  Thank goodness, Amazon refunded us. I will have to try another brand.",0
"Cuts in only one place, going to have to find a way to sharpen them",0
Great product,1
The dogs seem to love these but I just am not convinced that Greenies help with teeth.,0
"This the best leash ever!!!!  My son's puppy had bitten through 3 leashes prior to this one.  Each on the same day they were purchased.  He bites, chews, pulls etc and this one holds strong.  So worth the money.  Will never buy any other brand or kind.",1
"To flimsy for even our teacup Pom, had to spend an extra $52 for a top and anchors strong enough to hold it all down..",0
"I found them to be completely useless. My dog ate the pill pocket and separated the pill right out, leaving it laying on the floor.",0
Did not work!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"But neither of my cats will eat it.  Noses are turned up immediately.  Probably good food, and if you starve your spoiled brats for a few days (like they do in TV commercials)  they will probably go for it, but mine will have no part of it.",0
"Ha both my cats love this..when they finally catch the butterfy, they drag it around the house which is fun to watch",1
They were to big for my dog and I need to return them.  I purchased rubber booties which worked better.,0
I still have not received any results,0
Works like a charm! Stops our dog from barking at persons coming into our home that she doesn't know.,1
Much better than previous versions.,1
"Round cages are not suitable to have ANY kind of bird in. Birds need a safe, dark corner that they know exists where they can go to sleep, and hide out in when necessary. The circular shape of this cage literally makes birds go crazy with anxiety, as there is no way for them to know which side is where. Google this if you don't believe me. It's also WAY too small for anything bigger than a budgie. You also need soft rope perches in the cage because the wood is too hard and ends up hurting birds' feet long term. Please do research before you buy a bird and stuff it in there.",0
Is great and the dog loves it,1
"Thank you item as described shipped in timely manner
..",1
Excellent. It is expensive but really works amazingly. Great investment on my cats.,1
"I tried this on my beautiful kitty, after reading all the rave reviews. This is what instantly happened to his eye. I should have paid attention when he was freaking out while I was using it on him. My sweet girl kitty was howling when I did her ears, but her eyes are fine. Please do not do this to your kitties.",0
"Please slowly acclimate your cat to this food if they weren't on this diet before because I switched to this immediately after my cat ran out of her cat food and let me tell you her bloating and diarrhea game are no joke right now. Im currently not letting her eat for about a day so that her stomach can calm down and then Ill slowly introduce it back to her. But pls if you have your cats old cat food slowly mix this in with their food, starting at 25% instinct and 75% their old cat food and keep upping the instinct ratio everyday until you can cut the old cat food out. Your cats stomach and bowels will thank you and me for this.

 I do think this is a good cat food and you should always feed your cat premium grain free cat food (if you can afford it) because itll be better for their health later on.",1

My story: I have one young Maine coon-mix, hyperactive cat which is a grazer and doesn't eat much at one time and another senior, alpha kitty which can eat a buffalo and still be hungry. I give them canned food (1/2 of 3oz can each) for both breakfast and dinner and used to leave them 1/4 cup high-quality dry food in separate bowls for them to munch through the day while I am gone for work. However my senior kitty (she is a bully) would eat most of the food and started getting really fat. So I got this for the younger grazer so that he can munch to his will all day.
Pros: 1) it can read both microchip and RFID chip which it comes with.
2) it comes with two bowls and since it becomes airtight, one can leave canned food in it instead of dry food if you need to.
3) it can hold 2 cups of dry food which can last for at least 2-4 days depending on if you supplement with wet food.
4) you can lock out your other cat so it works great for households with multiple cats or dogs where you need to feed one or more cat more or a prescription diet.
5) It has a learning program in it to use to train your cat. My cat learnt to eat from it very easily, almost in the first attempt. But then my cats are freakishly smart sometimes so I don't know if other cats will learn it this fast or not.

Cons:
1) it doesn't have a hood of any kind which is stupid as the other cat learnt to eat from the other side again at the first attempt. (Told you my cats are freakishly smart). I solved this by putting it between stuff so that the only way to go near it is the front, like the pic I shared (I am smart too.. Haha).
2) Doesn't hold enough food if you need to leave your cats for a long weekend trip. Not really a huge problem but I don't know why this thing doesn't come with a food storage attached, as that would solve the open backside thing too.
3) The cat which is allowed to eat can eat too much if he's in the mood. Sometimes he will eat so much that he won't eat the wet food anymore.

Specific problems I had with my unit:
1) I think my product was defective or something because it didn't recognize my younger cat's microchip. However, it did recognize my fat cat's microchip so I didn't understand what the issue was. Also, it recognized the RFID chip so I used it for my younger, grazer cat.
2) the unit started malfunctioning a bit within a few days and would not open on time sometimes and my cat would sit in front of it confused.
It's so expensive that I didn't want to risk it anymore so I returned it.
I ended up buying another RFID feeder called Wireless Whiskers (I bought a used one from eBay so it was much cheaper than the original price). It had all the pros except that I can't use it with wet food but it also solved all the cons as both cats can use it and I can allot a time for either of them and no one eats too much. And it's working great for the last 3 months.",1
Quick delivery.  I recommend.,1
Do not ever use this product!!! I used this on my dog Oscar this morning and found him like this! His entire body was covered in red open wounds and his hair was falling out. He was immediately brought to the vet and now he's got weeks worth of medication and ointments that he needs to be on. Do not use this on your animals.,0
"Has both a squeaker and a rattle, so my dog loves it!",1
This stuff smells great and my kitten doesn't mind having her ears massaged at all. She came to us with ear mites and after 5 days of treatment her ears are clear and smell great. No more ice!,1
"This helps with my dog's hip and joint point. He's old and you can tell that he's not only getting a delicious treat, but also something that helps him enjoy the last of his years even more with less pain. Thank you guys so much for this amazing product!",1
Bought these to replace the 2CR1/3N batteries in my Pet Stop collar.  This battery was too long to fit in the battery compartment and there seems to be no way to make it work.,0
This brush was recommended to me by my puppy's breeder. Works wonderfully and he didn't take long to getting used to being combed out.,1
"Pro: ample size for 1 or 2 cats . Or a Dog up to say 20 Lbs.
Pretty color, nice size door for placing or retrieving your animals.
Cons : No Handle on top for lifting the cage ( how are you supposed to carry your pets around)
Someone dropped the ball on this one !!
If you grasp the cage from the top and try to carry it around , it bends the bars because they ARE soo thin and it starts to collapse ! WTH !",0
"This product was not as described.  You can barely see the collar flasing over the dog's fur, and my dog's coat is not as thick as other dogs such as a German Shepperd.  I purchased the small, and it is HUGE.  It actually only fits my large dog.  It is too big for my little one.  It smells like chemicals so quite frankly i am worried to even put it on the dog.  I will not use this product.  I'm sorry to say this but this product is a piece of crap.  Ok, i'm not sorry...it had to be said.  Don't waste your money.",0

My blue heeler had this thing into shreads in one day.. I was expecting it to last a week at least if it was a kong toy,0
Worked great for 2 weeks then it lost it's flow and stopped working as well.,0
Great for the two days it lasted! The velcro is a joke and my dog ripped it off on his first try. He simply grabbed one edge with his teeth and the top portion that goes over the knob ripped.  Feel kind of dumb for having spent this money on something going in the trash almost as soon as I received it!,0
"Update 6/28/18
This company is SEEDY. Don't accept any shipped replacement parts from them and read the warranty very carefully. See clips below:

""A replacement Product or part assumes the remaining warranty of the original Product.""
""This Limited Warranty does not cover the cost of returning the Product to Feed and Go; this is your responsibility.""
""Manufacturers warranties may not apply in all cases, depending on factors such as use of the product, where the product was purchased, or who you purchased the product from.""

I was able to secure a refund through Amazon's excellent customer service and this company is now under investigation as the 'replacement' part they sent me was also faulty and thus couldn't have voided the warranty. In addition to the massive increase in price over a short period of time and this incredibly shady 'warranty', a history of poor customer service, the list could go on and on. I urge you to heed caution before making this purchase...

Update 6/25/18
My feeder broke after I used it for 3 months. I contacted the company, they sent me a replacement part, I resumed use for 2 weeks before it stopped working altogether. I thought-no problem, these things happen and this is still under the 1 year warranty. A product built in America, family-owned small business surely will honor their warranty. Sure enough, as soon as I asked for the warranty return information, my emails went unanswered and have remained unanswered over several weeks. This company's ethics are atrocious Marissa Mcdaniel -the founder- will be getting a notice of a report through the FCC since she is not honoring her warranty agreements.

Also-fyi for new buyers, the price of this feeder is currently set at $250, I bought it for $150 less than a year ago, so note the huge jack up of price. When paired with horrendous customer service and faulty products, completely not worth the money.

For what its worth, I bought a battery operated feeder for $30. It's quieter than this, it's actually cat-proof, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper. I've been using it for a month with no issues. It's not a smart feeder, but with the terrible app Feed and Go has and the horrendous camera quality, I never utilized the expensive 'smart' features anyways.

Previous review:
Motivations for getting an automated pet feeder:
1. Feed my cats more frequently
2. Feed my cats on a more consistent schedule (as opposed to them waiting to eat because I'm stuck in a meeting)
3. Get them to shut the hell up in the middle of the night :)

This feeder does the job, which is why I've kept one of two. I have two cats, however, they share with this feeder just fine. Things to note, my cats are already relatively sharing, I used to feed them in bowls side by side, they often switched sides and ate out of each other's bowls previously. This port is not quite wide enough for them to share side by side, but one can hog the bowl for a min or two before the other will butt in to get his share. There haven't been any fights and neither cat is losing/gaining weight, so as of right now, I trust that they are eating the proper portions.

The reason I gave this feeder a two star review:
1. This is not cat proof. My cats can actually break into it, and they did so for the first two days. I left it alone and I think they eventually got accustomed to the schedule and just stopped putting their paw under the panel to pull the food forward because they were satisfied in between meals, but I honestly can't say for sure. (see the attached picture and my cat's adorable guilty face)
2. Other reviewers mentioned that the camera was a let down for the price-other users must not have black cats. The camera is literally useless. All I see if blackness when my cats are eating, so I guess it's helpful that I know if there's blackness my cats must be eating, but the picture isn't even clear enough to make out the body or head of a cat whatsoever. I have two black cats and there's no way for me to even identify if they're both eating or nearby. It's completely useless.
3. The app is mediocre and malfunctions often.
4. The system itself has malfunctioned and not fed my cats due to a mysterious blockage, but after we checked profusely there were no blockages. A machine restart resulted in it working again. That is deeply concerning for when we are not home or if we wanted to rely on this feeder for an overnight trip somewhere.
5. Customer service was polite, but not supportive. I liked this as an American-made product, I purchased through Amazon which typically results in good customer service, but this team was not that helpful. While they said I could return my unopened product, they were not willing to pay for shipping which is the norm with Amazon purchases. This is super heavy so now I am stuck to make the decision to pay an astronomical amount in shipping to return it and end up getting about half my money back after having to foot the expense of a return, while they are able to sell the machine for full-profit again, or I have to keep it and make no use of it. Buyer beware, buy one first and see if you need it, don't buy two unless you're certain you need it and read the reviews first because they won't help you ship this back to them.",0
There's nothing to attach it to the cage with...,0
"I knew when I completed my move from the country to the suburbs that my three-legged cat Mr. Tub Tubs was going to have to transition from an indoor/outdoor cat, to a strictly indoor kitty. Living near a busy road with lots of cars, I didn't want to chance him having another run in with a car and losing another limb. I was worried that he would have a difficult time transitioning, but at first, he seemed to be loving the heating and air conditioning. I noticed however once spring time hit and we had the windows of the house open, he was becoming increasingly desperate to go explore outside. I started by allowing him to spend time out on our second story deck, but quickly realized that wasn't going to work in the long term because he kept trying to dive bomb off the side. I did some research on options for harnessing cats, but was worried that a traditional small dog harness could be easily escaped from. I also read many reviews on other ""cat harnesses"" that talked about their feline companions escaping and running off. This was definitely something I wanted to avoid considering we were in a new scary place with lots of cars, children, and new sounds he had never heard. I loved the idea of the Kitty Holster because it could be loosened and tightened with ease by the use of sturdy Velcro. I also liked the fact that it was similar to a vest, which reminded me of the thunder jackets you see at pet stores to help keep animals calm and make them feel safe. As soon as the Kitty Holster arrived, I immediately wanted to try it out. I've read horror stories about cats freezing up and refusing to walk so I wanted to see how he would do. *Please note that Mr. Tub Tubs is an extremely friendly, easy going kitty who acts more like a dog than a cat! If your cat is skiddish, this product may not work for you!* I strapped the vest on him, and  he didn't really seem to care; he was more curious about the leash I attached to the ring on the back and wanted to play with it. However I yelled for him at the front door and he came sprinting; I think he knew he was going to get to go outside. We sat out on the porch for a good 20 minutes and let him explore the flower beds and newly planted bushes. We also allowed him to explore the dirt where our sod would soon be planted before it began raining. He did have a mini ""freak out"" when some kids came by on their scooters because they were making noise, and he wasn't real crazy about the cars, but he did pretty well considering he was in a new place, with new sounds and smells. He really can only stand the vest for about 30 minutes or so before he's ready to take it off, so we try and allow him to go outside for short amounts of time in the evening. We also occasionally take him on short car rides to the ball field trying to get him used to traveling. Overall i'm extremely happy with the quality of the vest, as well as its stability. My main concern was that the Velcro closures would hold up if he took of sprinting because he was scared, which he has, and it did! I would definitely recommend this Holster to anyone who wanted to try taking their cat outside, simply for the fact that it will keep kitty safe and secure inside in the event of a scare.",1
Too small and flimsy,0
Although it was a good idea for a toy my cat took it apart within minutes needs to be durable more adorable and if you ever need a cat to try it out let me know,0
"My 10 week old Sheepadoodle puppy loves these! Nice & soft, & easy to tear into small pieces.",1
"Didn't know I could freeze it. No instructions can with it. I end up returning it due to price & my puppy at that time wasn't interested in it. Maybe would have kept it if I knew I could freeze it. Wet it 1st, ok. Thanks.",0
"Not satisfied, I expected much more. I won't do business with this company again.",0
"My 14 year old drahthaar loves this bed more than any other bed I've ever purchased for her, and I've tried at least four or five different varieties. It is extremely well padded and the high sides are very nice. She likes that she can bury her head against the sides. I call it her ""boat"" because she looks a bit like she's in a row boat while not sleeping in it.",1
Works great! No smell or residue like traditional flea collars! Works for months as advertised! We haven't had a single flea in years while using this product.,1
"Fits a little loose in back, but I don't regret the purchase.  The sizes run a little small for the weights listed.",1
Sturdy bags and I love that they are earth friendly,1
Sizing is terrible! You need to get 1 to 2 sizes bigger than your dog usually has!,0
"I adopted a cat from a rescue shelter and he was underweight, vomiting and had very smelly diarrhea. I purchased Iams and Science diet dry and wet and he barely touched either food. His foster mom said he liked Friskies but I just could not feed my cat a food filled with by products, fillers, and dyes that are not good for cats. I started to research cat diets on line and came across a veteranarian article that recommended Natural Balance as being the best commercial cat food. It seemed to contain all the ingredients that veteranarians and cat experts recommended for a balanced natural (omnivore) cat diet. I ordered a few cases online and hoped that I was not wasting more money on expensive cat food.  Well, my cat gobbled it down the first day. I did not even have to mix it with old food -- he took to it immediately and begs for it several times a day now.  So far he likes the Venison and pea and the Chicken and liver pate. He is gaining weight and has lots of energy and bright clear eyes. Best of all, he has not vomited and his bowel movements are completely normal now. (In fact there is absolutely no smell and miminal waste, I am sure because the food is being digested properly) I am planning on trying other flavor varieties.  This cat food is definitely worth the money. BTW -- the smell is what I would expect from high quality cat food - in fact it is better than I expected. I disagree with the other reviewer's comment about the horrible smell.",1
This was much better designed that the other one we have.  I liked the solid feel that will keep in place and the deep rubber pile since it can catch a lot more cat litter before it tracks on the home floors.,1
Great Product  Works Great,1
Our Puggle Tyler found a seam to chew thru in the mouth in about an hour. He shredded from that in no time. Will not buy again.,0
"Item arrived only half full , very small , does smell nice though",0
"Quite small, much smaller than ""for dogs below 30 pounds"" would suggest. I would have said for dogs below 20 pounds would probably be more accurate. Also this toy, while marketed under the Kong brand and sold at a comparatively premium Kong price, really lacks the durability of the Kong brand and isn't particularly special as compared to any of dozens of other larger and better priced rope toys out there. Most rope toys of this size will last about two weeks before my dog has chewed a piece off of them. This lasted minutes. Would not recommend.",0
excllent,1
"I am very pleased with the  tag. Very good quality no plastic, should last for years,",1
"This is just great, I wouldn't use anything else, there is never a smell of cat and it is easy to clean the litterbox",1
No too big for my pet.,0
"My cat has used these cardboard incline scratchers forever, it's his favorite material to scratch on. This is the first time I've bought the Kong brand and while they are sturdy and nice, they come with the large label on the front that you see in the picture. The problem is that this is glued on with a large amount of hard glue and it's impossible to remove so there is an unusable area right smack dab in the middle of the scratcher which isn't great. I probably won't buy this brand again because of this, I've never had this issue with the Cosmic incline scratchers.",0
Too messy and smelly.,0
Cute and fun tunnels that came quick!,1
"Not only do I love it, but my kitties do too!",1
Awful. Dog put a big hole in it in 10 mins. Waste of money.,0
"Good Strong clippers. make a quick, clean clip",1
Love this harness. It's easy to put on my dog and is very easy to control my dog.,1
The only thing I don't like about it is that it shifts on the seat when my dog moves around.,1
weak,0
not what i expected,0
Leaked badly. Ended up replacing it with a different brand.,0
How do you know when to stop? hair keeps coming off over and over. I honestly believe it is pulling it out at the root. Not much a deshedder. Seems more like a hair puller. i have had greater success washing the cat in the shower and cleaning off her loose hair that way.,0
"Dog still has fleas after Frontline, constant washing/vacuuming and this spray. My dog dislikes the strong odor so much she shakes. Over powering. Will not buy again.",0
"I bought this to take my cat to the vet and the groomer in. It's a super comfy bag and is soft on the inside. It seems a little narrow but my fat cat fit fine inside the smaller sized option. He actually prefers sleeping in this bag as opposed to his bed for some strange reason lol. It's nice that the carrier has two kid options. There's a screen in case your pet likes peeking out or you can close up the top using a thicker material that will shield them from being able to view anything that would otherwise cause them anxiety. It's a nice mesh material almost so if my cat has an accident it will be easy to clean. It's pretty stylish. My boyfriend was convinced that I purchased a new purse lol. Although, i did receive this item for a discount in exchange for an unbiased review, highly recommend purchasing this. It's high quality and a great value.",1
"Have had this set for about 3 months and one collar has been malfunctioning since about 2 weeks after I received it. Pretty hard to train your dog when the collar beeps, vibrated and shocks your dog all at the same time and happens randomly. Was hoping it would go away, but is getting worse. These collars did not get wet and were treated gently, i.e., they were on house dogs, and did not go hunting or anything. Maybe this is a fluke, but I would not buy again. When they work, they work great...but that didn't last long.",0
"It was a little difficult to be sure I was ordering the correct item but once I went to the Ideal Website, they gave very good details on how to be sure.  I ended up with the correct item the first try and it was super simple to install. I thought the price was very reasonable too.",1
"MEOWW MEOWWWLL MEEAAAAOOOWWW MEEEWWWW. Does that sound familiar? It is what I experienced for two hours every day: for the hour leading up to the morning feeding, and the hour leading up to the night time feeding. I couldn't take it much longer, so I broke down and contacted the inventor of the Super Feeder. He was able to put together a package of blemished/returned products for me that were a bit cheaper (although still pricey!)

It was soo worth it! They stopped the meowing THE VERY NEXT DAY. I've had it over a month now and they still aren't meowing for food. They LOVE it when it goes off! Another nice feature is that I set it to go off 4x a day, so they are getting fed twice as often (but the same amount of food per day.)

I use this with Blue Buffalo's Freedom Grain Free cat food. It is the perfect shape for the machine and good for the kitties.",1
Doesn't squeak...disappointed,0
Very comfortable,0
"My cat had a severe reaction to this collar but it wasn't immediate or the first time he had worn a Seresto collar.  When I put the second collar on him he started scratching after a few days.  By the time I figured out it was the collar, he had open sores under the collar and they were oozing.  I bought  both of the collars at a reputable pet store so they weren't knock offs.  He did fine with the first collar so I was shocked at the reaction he had to the second.  If you buy this collar, watch your cat.",0

"I purchased this Cosmic Pet Alpine scratcher replacement kit and it fits perfect in my Whisker City Play cavern cat scratcher box. I just took the refill, pulled the two halves apart and have 2 refills for the Whisker City scratcher.",1

"These are absolutely the worst training pads I've ever bought.  Amazon should actually be ashamed they're selling these, much less at the same price that Target.com sells the normal quality OUT! pads for.  I would return these if I could, but I already used one (let's just say it was an emergency) and not worth the hassle of shipping them back.  But I still have 48 more of these terribly junky pads to go.  The only reason I bought these instead of ordering from there is, Amazon has faster (Prime) shipping and couldn't an extra day to receive them.  MISTAKE!

Especially deceptive since they're the same name, same style packaging, and Amazon reviews actually gave these 3.5 stars, for some reason I can't possibly understand, unless they've changed.  I'd give them 0 stars if I could, they don't even deserve 1.  This is coming from a buyer of at least four other brands of training pads, so I know my stuff.  The only redeeming quality these have is they are the correct size to fit all standard doggy training pads.  Imagine the cheapest generic baby diapers, that's what the edge material is.  The middle layer is like some sort of cheap cotton padding.  Then when you peel the pads apart, the plastic badly edges stick together, and the center padding balls up and won't stay flat.  The absorbent material is non-quilted and totally falls apart when you try to unfold them, leaving giant holes in the center layer of the pad, which no careful amount of peeling apart will prevent.

After buying, I figured out the way you can tell the terrible ones from the real kind.  See the OUT package in the photo that's taller than it is wide?  That's the awful kind you never, ever, ever want to buy.  The reason it looks rectangular instead of square is they fold these differently than the normal pads, which are usually folded down into a square.  These pads are folded rectangularly.  Out! should also be ashamed they even make these.  They'll go in our ""en suite"" bathroom near the doggy's crate where he sleeps at night, and I have another package of pads I bought that were a bit more expensive from Petsmart (PS Essential) I was going to return but will use on our doggy's pad in the meantime, since they are acceptable.",0
These pellets sink too quickly :(,0
This cat cologne is great. It smells good and lasts a long time.,1
"My cat just didn't like this thing. I tried to get him to use it, but we couldn't get stage 1 right. He started pooping in the bathtub, and when I filled it with water, he pooped on the bed. Then he peed on every bed in the house (which he had NEVER done with a conventional litter box), in a clean basket of laundry, and even on a blanket on the couch, at which point I gave up. No bad behavior since I banished the LK to the garage.
If you can get your cat to do it, more power to you, and I am jealous!",0
"I purchased this to replace my Litter Genie. I have two cats, and the litter waste would fill the Litter Genie up fast and had to be emptied every 2-3 days, and the odor blocking bag refills cost $5 and only last a maximum of 2 wks. That's $10 min a month on refills alone. I bought the 15 lb container and scented 4 or 8 gallon trash bags to use as liners, and it works great! I don't smell a thing when it's shut and I have a dog nose so I can smell everything really good! (I use Fresh Step Multi-cat litter which is a MUST and hands down the BEST at clumping and controlling odors and I've tried them all! If you don't use it then you may have different smelly results lol). My container came intact and the latch works great so I didn't have the problems other reviews said they have. It allows me to make less trips to the dumpster and I even hot-glued some cardboard onto the lid to make a holder for my pooper scooper :D You can use this container for so many more things than pet food and are only limited by your imagination. I recommend it for what I am using it for! You could even paint it if you want to leave it out. I'm thinking about painting my ugly pink litter box or hiding it away in something I want to build soon. Hope this helps!",1

"Not my favorite retractable leash by far.  Feels very flimsy, not durable as advertized.  The ribbon gets locked very easily, which I don't feel is very safe when handling dogs.  10 feet of leash sounds like a lot, but it is actually not very long at all when out walking.",0
Received broken. I didn't notice until I already assembled the frame and cut a hole in my BRAND NEW screen door. Now I have a very large hole in it. I hope that they can send me a replacement ASAP.,0
Cute! Thank you.,1
Bucket was half the size I expected.  THe photois misleading.,1
I was looking for a good deal on salmon oil for my dog and came across this product that was described as 32 ounces of liquid. I was upset when it arrived and found that the bottle was less than two thirds full!!!! What a rip off! I will be looking for other products that don't lie about the amount of salmon oil in the  product.,0
This is a great product and a lifesaver for me.  I have been giving our dog this product for almost 2 years now and our his seizures have gone from 2 to 3 per month to around 3 per year and they are much shorter. As I didn't want to have to put him on daily anti-seizure medication and because the vet started thinking I was using the shots for myself... I decided to try another alternative.  I am so happy that I did.  It is making things so much easier for all of us.  The way I get him to take it is I make up a batch of cooked oatmeal (on the drier side) and supplement it with some peanut butter and the powder.  He begs for his meds every morning.  One thing I can say is make sure you are consistent with it.  It does take a few weeks to take effect and if you forget a few days the seizures may come back.  He is 11 pounds and I give him one tsp per day.  I make 2 weeks worth of meds at a time into logs and store in the fridge.,1
Perfect price for the perfect X-pen for a toy breed.  It even comes with the clips!  Shipping was very fast too.  I highly recommend this seller.,1
"this is a great product and a great value for the money, even had an adapter so you can run 2 air lines from the one pump.",1
Did not work at all...not even a slight difference,0
I am very happy they sell these refills.  I wouldn't like having to replace the entire cat toy.  I don't know any cat who doesn't like using these pads.,1
"I bought the 1.77 gallon, purple one today at a petstore for $19.99 and thought that my white & purple betta would look great in it. However, after I set it up and put Indie in it, I could hardly see him - the lid makes the tank too dark to see the natural colors of any fish that is in there. He looked all black or dark purple. I even put my desk lamp to shine over the top, but it was still too dark with the lid on; what more without any lighting at all? He looks much prettier when I lifted the cover for the light to shine in, but the lid seems to pop off from the hinges too easily, and I feel as if one day it will just slide off when I lift it for feedings and crack when it hits the floor. The gravel is a bright blue with the light on, and detracts from the beauty of the fish itself. The filter is quiet; you can hardly hear the hum. However, on the lowest setting, it is still a little too strong for a betta. I put it on the right rear corner of the tank, and placed the 'included' plant in front of it to slow down the current, but Indie seems to only swim around the left half of the tank. Overall, even though it's a reasonable price for a tank that comes with gravel, filter and a fake plant, I think it looks cheap. It looks nice on the box and there were good reviews on the store's website - that's why I bought it. If I had wanted one of those cheap plastic starter tanks, I could have gotten one for $8 or less. I will probably return it to the store and get something else.",0
"This bag had such a horrible chemical smell that the room I put it in now smells. I left it outside to air out for 3 days and the smell is still so strong that I would never allow a pet to be put inside this. I can't even donate it to a shelter because of it. The seller did refund me which was great but unless you want to kill the pet you are trying to safely transport, don't by this.",0
Bought largest size and did not fit the Rottie. After repeated efforts got them on but they were too tight and Rottie just thru them off bacause of the poorly designed Velcro strap fasteners. Would have returned these if I'd had the time and energy.,0
"This product does not work! I ordered it 3 months before my dog moved in.  After spending a long time getting the perimeter set up, and after my dog arrived yesterday, the system no longer works.  there is something wrong with the collar, Which i can send back (a week's time), the company checks the collar, and returns to me, (another week), and then train my dog, i am out about 3 weeks.  the company will not accept returns after a month, so i am out $400+.
Horrible service, horrible product, horrible company!",0
Much smaller than anticipated. It was probably my fault but some better product details would help.,0

"Poorly designed product. The name tag is not curved to fit the neck and the metal it is made of is thin and flimsy. This is a cosmetic product and not for day by day use. I was also concerned that the metal on the inside of the collar might cause cuts or scratches. Anyway, the tabs that hold the tag on the collar broke off while trying to curve the tag to fit the neck and eliminate the tabs from facing into the neck. The idea is good, the execution fails.",0
It is a very cute dress  but the belly part like a xsmall size and the straps are overlong for my chihuahua.,0
"So sorry that I actually purchased two refills....I ruined one trying to figure out how to install it.  My experience with the entire system:  If I could give this 0 stars and return it...I would.  This is a really cheap, poorly constructed and poorly designed container.  I have never written a 1 star review on a product that I purchased on Amazon but this is it.  The instructions are in the very bottom of the container...my container lid was stuck and took forever to get open...the refill bags don't self feed into the container even when full of litter/waste, resulting in my having to put on plastic gloves and feed the bag down into the system.  There are so many little places for the waste to stick that cleaning this would be a nightmare...instead, unfortunately, it's going directly into the trash...I don't want to have bother cleaning it to return the item to Amazon.  This same review will be copied and pasted onto the two refill cartridges that I purchased...I wasted one before figuring out that I have to tie a knot in the bottom of the bag.  There are so many wonderful ""perks"" on this product...they just don't work as intended...it's a shame it wasn't designed better with higher quality of materials.  This is far too much of a hassle to really be used....a small trash can with a step lid will be much easier...I'd rather tie my own bag and drop into the covered trash each night than put my hands near the waste to get the disposal bags on this to feed properly.  YUCK!",0
Great food for our pet!,1
Worked last year but my animals are still infested. Bummer.,0
"I was going to have to buy new carpet. My berber had so many stains and the ""men in the yellow van cleaners"" couldn't get the stains out.  I decided to try one last product before I had to go and purchase new carpet.  I have never written a review about items, but you have to try this !!!  I used this product today & Bubba's is the best out there.  Better than the professionals that come to your house !!  It looks like I have new carpet. It even took out a grease stain that my antique desk chair left on the carpet. I am going to buy another bottle today. Thank you Bubba's !!",1

"Sadly after having this same harness for 4 years with no issues the new one would fray at the seems after just a few walks. Got it replaced the first time, but the second time it was just past it's return period and we were stuck. Never even got a reply from the manufacturer on it either.",0

It's extremely huge. I purchased the small for my small dog and it really looks like the bowl would be for a large dog. What's the point of the bowl if it's still large enough to not prevent them from swallowing their food at once?,0
Awesome product! My dogs love how far I can throw it and race each other to get the ball. Highly recommend.,1

"My Rhodesian Ridgeback has a small wound on his leg which is aggravated by his attempts to lick it.  I have been applying elastic dressings daily, but sought an alternative that might allow exposure and more rapid healing, without his being able to access it to lick it.  A cone-collar is an alternative, but painful to me, when he runs into my legs with it, either knocking me down or causing painful crippling!
Unfortunately, this collar simply DOES NOT WORK.  We waited in eager anticipation for its delivery, and found that it is made of sturdy and heavy nylon fabric, and requires inflation, after which one is instructed to attach it to the dog's regular collar, and apply it around his neck.  This concept does not work, even briefly!  I followed these instructions diligently, placed the dog's collar with attached inflated ""protective collar"" on the dog, and released him.  He shook his head a couple times, placed his front paws on the inflatable collar, and removed both his regular collar and the donut collar, in approximately 8.3 seconds from his first encounter!  Subsequent trials were much briefer.
I can conceive of purchasing a chest harness to better secure the donut to his neck, but I have already spent over $32 for a collar that only works for about 8 seconds!  Unfortunately, these numbers, and the relative efforts involved, just don't add up!",0
The unit works adequately but it explodes the very expensive shampoo packets. We have gone through 1 packet per wash of our toy poodle because of the shampoo's plastic bag splitting.,0

awsome,1
"Our puppy has some separation anxiety that leads her to love chewing, but this toy is really helpful for both of those things! We put a knife full of peanut butter in the middle and she gets so excited to figure it out that she hasn't realized that we aren't paying attention to her and it takes her a while to get it out! She might chew this thing to pieces, but it would take her a while. When we're home with her I just make sure to say no when I hear her chewing, and she goes right back to licking it. So far it has been working out really well!",1
Not what I thought it was,0
"I bought one bag and found my canaries ate this so quickly  I usually use chopped boiled eggs in one dish and a dry homemade nestling food in another dish.  I felt the fresh egg and my home made mix was better for my birds.  One bag was not enough to judge growth of chicks with 4 pairs of parents, since they ate it so quickly.  I  think the red Quiko mix would be nice for red canary babies.",1
I ordered xl and it's incredibly small!  It won't even fit over my dog's head!,0
This was sized to small.  The large would fit a small dog.  My dog only weighs 30 lbs a large is usually to big until washed.  The size chart is wrong,0
Cute but they said they were XL!  XS more like it! Very miss sized and it took so long to get them I just gave them to a friend with a little dog instead of dealing with the hassle of sending them back!,0

"Nice value for this price range. Well constructed and screwing in top level wasn't too difficult. Power drill is needed. It is a nice quality tree. More substantial that Armarkat and less so than Molly and Friends. The posts are solid wood. Properly installing the top took me 1/2 hour to measure, pre drill and attach. Screws are pre drilled into bed but not the pole. After removing the screws from the bed to drill your pole pilot holes, you may want to mark the holes in the bed with a black marker as the holes are very hard to see or feel in the carpeting. My cats are enjoying this tree and Meiko prefers this sissal as opposed to the 5 other cat trees. I would buy New Cat again as it is a good quality without being overly heavy like Molly and Friends. Laid out so getting from one level to next level is medium difficult though So I keep one next to stairs by front door. They can greet me without getting trampled by the dog. Mitzy sleeps in top level at night. Nice fit for a14 pound cat. I am glad I did not get the similar model with deeper beds because she likes to stretch a limb over the side from time to time. Condo in photo keeps them busy in the bedroom cat nook so us humans can get some sleep.",1
"These clippers really cut well. I've had them for quite some time, and the edge seem to be holding up well.
I use them on my adult cats. Especially good for the very old cats when their nails get thick and brittle.

She was fortunately naturally well behaved in general but would pull ceaselessly on walks to the point of gasping for minutes. This collar is dramatically effective in my case.

"Great Kong toy again! My dog loves that it squeaks, I love that I can grab the football and she can't just wrestle it away, my guy friends like that it is football shaped, we all love that we can spiral it, and because it is elongated and isn't just round we can safely teach my dog to tug/play without worrying she will accidentally bite our hands instead of the ball.  She loves it and has obsessed about it more than other toys so we don't let her keep it- seems pretty obvious that she would be able to tear through it fairly quickly if she tried, but maybe I'm wrong since she hasn't yet. Sturdy, yes, invincible? I wouldn't put money on it.",1

"I was a little unsure about trying this product at first, but after many years of struggling with four litter boxes for three cats, and many failures of automated litter boxes, I was ready to try something new. First of all, this system WORKS. Period! I know that results and expectations will vary from person to person and cat to cat, but short of some wildly expensive piece of cat-specific plumbing in my house, this is truly revolutionary - at a very reasonable price. It's a can't-lose proposition - for the cost of two big buckets of premium clumping litter, you get to try a way to get rid of your worst litter problems. Cleaning up after cats is truly a ""breeze"" now - which makes it more enjoyable to take care of them!

Day one: the first box arrives. I put it beside our biggest ""problem box."" Cats were regularly peeing outside or on the edge of this one, in part because it takes forever to sift through and clean four litter boxes, and that discourages me from doing it as regularly as I should or could. Breeze boxes set up in seconds, and you're left asking yourself, ""Is that it? Is that all there is to it?"" I add in a small piece of poo and a urine clump to the pellets, per the instructions, and the next morning there is a sopping wet pee pad in the new box. They love it for #1 - that is clear! But no poo, though there are clear signs of ""burying"" behaviour.

A few days later, a second box arrives. Same setup in seconds, same ""priming"" the box with a clump and a stool from another box. Same results - plenty of pee on the pad, no poo. The cats are ""talking"" to us a lot now about the new setup, and continue to use the old boxes. I shift the mats in front of the old boxes to being in front of the new boxes, just to give them the hint that these are the preferred spots.

Pellets do stick a bit to their feet, it seems, but the spillage out of the box from this is TINY compared to their usual spraying of litter all over the joint - and the constant sweeping of the area to remove litter dust. It's simple to just pick up the nearby ""escaped"" pellets and toss them back in. The little scoop that hooks on the to box' white splash guard is perfect - don't hook it on the inside as the promotional photo shows, hook it with the scoop facing the outside, so it won't interfere with the box space.

The urine pad tray is easily reversed, with a pull-out handle on either end, and since the cats seem to prefer one end of a given litter box to another for that purpose, this makes it easy to reverse a pad and get urine soaked up on the other end of it. Removal and replacement of pads is quick and simple - a no-brainer. If you want to spray a touch of some enzymatic odor removing spray on the pads that may extend their life a bit, but it is co comparatively cheap to change them out, it seems to be hardly worth it - don't press it, just swap when it's soggy.

Finally, I decide to take a ""leap of faith"" and get two more Breeze boxes. Ready for a complete swapout. With all four in place next to the old boxes, and allowing the old ones to get ""stinky"" (not hard!), I remove one of the old boxes. Yay! But still, no poo is showing up in the Breeze boxes. I remove a second old box. Still no poo in the Breeze boxes. Hmm, getting nervous, now! I remove a third old box. A day passes. Then, some very loose poo shows up in one of the Breeze boxes. Yes, loose stools are not fun in general, but it wasn't as bad as I thought that it would be - I just tidied up the area on the grate where the pee flows down to the bad, which took only seconds, and poured in a few extra pellets.

A day or so later, a solid poo shows up in the same Breeze box. These cats have their preferences for spots, obviously. The pellets stick to the poos a bit if you catch them when they're super-fresh, but with a bit of shaking, most land back in the box - no sense forcing the issue, if they're sticky they're dirty, and it's a small price to pay. Best of all, contrary to other reports, our cats ARE burying their poos - you just have to make sure to catch them quickly enough, perhaps, and not let them build up.

And this is the REAL point of the Breeze boxes - checking and cleanup is FAST! I would dread the half hour or so that it would take to properly sweep up cat litter dust, clean or replace liners and litter in four boxes, sift through litter for those ""hidden bits,"" clean up after leaking liner bags, lug out ginormously heavy bags to the trash can, and so on. Now I can do all four boxes in a matter of ten minutes or less, and I actually look forward to doing it twice a day now - that was rarely if ever the case with clumping litter! The system encourages you to take much better care of your cats, which is great.

Finally, the last, way-stinky old litter box goes out the door. Tension rises - will there be ""accidents?"" I go down in the morning, and there are TWO boxes with well-formed stools, all pads are being used. It works! It all works! Huzzah!

Finally, there's the issue of cost. If you buy the pellets and pads in bulk via Amazon or other online services, they're about as much as you'd pay in a local store, but for one-offs, store pricing is better, it seems. The main problem is supply - we're not seeing Breeze products in our grocery stores, so check out your local pet stores, which seem to have reasonable supplies of pellets and pads, and, sometimes, boxes. Since the Breeze system eliminates a lot of other things that these stores sell, maybe they're not eager to showcase this product?

Overall, with a four-box setup, it seems that the cost of maintenance will be about the same or less than regular premium clumping litter products, but when you factor in the significant reduction in cleaning products, liner bags, deodorants and so on, total cost of ownership has to be significantly less than traditional or clumping litter - and much less landfill impact. I now have a big pile of obsolete supplies, which we will donate to an animal shelter.

There is as I mentioned the vast savings in time, but also the savings in health for us and the cats. Less litter dust means fewer germs transmitted, and cleaner litter also means fewer germs that can cause upset kitty tummies. I've been noting a lot of litter dust falling on to the pee pads on the Breeze boxes from the old litter systems, at least until the full swapout, which is probably an indication of just how dirty their paws were because of traditional litter. Expect a much cleaner home with this system!

So that's it, glad to answer questions or give feedback, this has to be one of the most well thought-out products for pets EVER. I'd love to have a ""self-flushing"" version of this sort of system, but short of that, this is the very best that you can get, in my opinion. Thanks, Tidy Cat!",1
"I installed two airstones in my tank and could not keep them from popping up and whipping around, no matter how I tried to bury the tubing.  I found this product and it works great.  The suction cups stick to the side of the tank well and have not popped off yet.  The tubing is held in place as well as the airstones.  It also comes with valve controls which are great to adjust the flow of the air through the airstones. It was inexpensive and well worth the purchase.",1
"We received this toy today. After less than ten minutes of playing, this is the state of the toy. One tail has already given up the ghost, and the others are on their way. Our dog is a ~45 lb. lab. We have loved other Kong toys, but this one does not compare.

Update: Within 4.5 hours, all the legs are gone.",0
"The tube is too large.  There is no way to start/stop the flow once you start syphoning.  I had a better one several years ago and regret getting rid of it (I went through a period without any aquarium).  Unfortunately, I have looked extensively and do not see the older models any more.",0
Beware! This turned my white dog ORANGE! It would NOT shampoo out! She only wore it for 2 hours and was in water for 30 minutes. Now I have to live with a orange dog until her fur grow out. I am not happy!!!!,0
"I didn't care about the reflective tape being bad that everyone else seems to complain about, but my main issue is that these aren't strong enough to stay on a cat. The clasp is just a simple clip that you pull on, even an infant could remove this. My cat which is still technically a kitten being less than 1 year old easily removes the collar, heck I don't even know where it is now. It's not a good design, if you make collars for cats which don't like having things on them, make the clasp that babies can't remove because cats are smarter than babies.",0
Didn't help with smell.,0
Great dog shampoo that helps to stop itchy skin,1
"A whole bottle, no carbon filter, bought a heater, tank at 88 deg (higher than the 86 recomended) and the ick has killed 7 of my 10 cichlids, the other 3 have more ick than before I started using this stuff, ugh...",0
The costume is very cute but it's not a good fit for medium to large dogs. The chest area is to shallow and the sleeves are to short and look awkward on the dog.,0
The BEST deep litter box one could ever own - easy clean plastic etc - the plant can be replaced by any fake thing you want to stick in there - 4 stars because I feel the opening wall on the bottom should be closed off so that the litter isn't sprayed out during the 'cover the poop' process.,1
I have used this product for my dog before with good results. The price on Amazon was the lowest I found so I ordered it. Unfortunately I had to return the product because it did not work at all. I was refunded promptly.,0
"""Product Dimensions:  11.2 x 5.5 x 3.5 inches ; 10.4 ounces"" This is inaccurate.  Each bone is only 7"" long, and 3.17 oz and 90 g.  I thought the bones would be 11.2"" long each.  I tried to imagine I misread it and it was multiplied by 3 (for 3 bones), but 7x3=21...a bit confusing! (as opposed to the ""Dingo Bone Large (White 8.0-8.5"" 99G) 3.5-Ounce"" it shows right above product dimensions, which I apparently missed).  These bones are MUCH smaller than I anticipated, and takes a large dog (especially a large puppy) not long at all to demolish.",0
found out product contained pyrethins after I placed order. Found info on another website. One would think that as important as pyrethins are it would be listed in the product features!,0
These are rather flimsy and do not hold the pad...they stretch.  I would not buy again.,0
"Very small fit, almost looks like it's meant for a cat not a dog",0
"I agree with the other reviewer that the product smell is a little unpleasant, but not overwhelming. The chews don't last extremely long for my big dogs. These don't chip into shards or get really smushy so I feel safe letting them chew without supervision. I like knowing that they are getting a natural source of glucosamine and chondroitin, especially since one has arthritis. I used to order these from ""Only Natural Pet Store"", but they are a little more expensive there and always seem to be out of stock. I'm so glad that I found these on Amazon.",1
"Only lasted 2 months before blowing out. I thought Zoo Med was bad, Exo Terra is even worse.",0
"I bought this for my increasingly finicky dog, but he snubbed this as well.  Even my Pitt that eats everything snubbed it",0
"I use this for my 46 pd Pibble. She's not a puller and typically sticks either at my side or immediately behind me. Though she is fine with the typical collar/snap on leash I really like the simplicity and ease of use a lead leash brings. The plus with this specific lead (I own a couple of the same brand) is that it is soft, feels good in the hand and I don't have to worry about it chaffing her neck.",1
"Totally worthless for my Shih Tzu.  I cant imagine what animal it would work well on, the tines are so small.
I would return  it except that I threw the packaging away.",0
"I bought two of these for two different dogs. The large dog had it for 3 days before tearing it open, he enjoyed playing tug with it, but we had to take it away after he got a hole in it so he wouldn't eat the stuffing. The smaller dog had a hole in it in literally 1.5 minutes, I timed her. I also had to take it from her so she wouldn't eat the stuffing. This toy is very cheap, it was probably worth purchasing for the big dog, but I threw away that money on giving one to the smaller dog. I gave 2 stars for the tug of war the one dog was able to enjoy.",0
The best treat yet for our dog. They are US made and have no dye or other junk in them. He loves them and they seem to be good for him. Thanks for carrying them,1
This is a really cute toy. Don't buy it for avid chewers. My dog had the cover off in ten minutes.,0
not much help,0
"This is too small for a betta fish (or any fish). And way too expensive. You can get a 2.5 gallon tank with a lid cheaper than this at PetSmart! I know it seems counterintuitive but most pet stores and suppliers are misinformed about bettas. Learn about betta fish and their care from breeders and enthusiasts (like the Nippy Fish site), NOT sellers. To dispel some common myths about bettas:

- They do not live in small dirty puddles in the wild. The recommended tank size is 5+ gallons. They need at LEAST 1 gallon, and 2.5 gallons and up is much better.
- They shouldn't be with or near other bettas unless breeding.
- They are carnivores and need carnivore fish food. They do not eat plants, and they shouldn't eat dried pellets, flakes or freeze-dried food, which bind them up.
- They need heated water (75-80).
- They need a clean tank just like every other fish.
- A single betta with the correct supplies for living by itself will cost about $100. Or it can live in a larger aquarium with certain types of other fish.

Hope that helps!",0

"I received this item at a discount for an honest review.

The item looked great and it was soft but lasted no more than 2 minutes in my house. She had it apart and all over the place by the time t took me to walk to the trash and throw away the packaging. This item is not for a normal sized dog.  Maybe for a small dog or a dog that does not chew but not for a normal active dog. Will not last.",0
"I bought this based on the other 2 reviews and will purchase again for my one dachshund.  The other one has a sensitive stomach and an over active immune system so they did not work for him.  However, for the other one I have noticed an improvement in his energy.  He struggles with allergies especially grass and he so loves to roll in the grass.  He has been using immunotherapy drops which helped but Banfield started him with a shot this month which worked the same day and what a difference.  I will continue to buy this as I feel he is generally a happier little guy when on it.  They are both 12 years old.  I am buying mine from Swanson.",1
"Fits just right, no rubbing, looks good, goes on easily, Love it!",1

GREAT DEAL,1
"The product is advertised as ""Wild Delight Crunch N Nut Squirrel Food (Qty: 4) - Size: 8 Pound"".  That seems to mean four 8-pound bags per order.  I received only one 8-pound bag.  Although the product itself was as expected, the value is very poor because the price is very high per pound.  The product advertisement is very misleading.",0
I have found this to be a great carrier for my 16# cat.  He has enough room to turn around on the comfortable flooring and can see out of the netted sides.  Easy to pull.  Wish there was a strap on each side for easier lifting.,1
"I was hesitant to spend the money for this filter. I have a 40 gallon tank and I was getting sick of cleaning it all the time. This keeps the tank clean and smelling good. The filter takes out a lot of the ""gunk"" and the water fall keeps things from growing in the water. I use my filter in a tank for aquatic turtles so if you are planning on using this as a dock for the turtles to get out of the water that will not work. There are lines for the water height and so there is no way for the turtles to get on the top of it (unless you build something). Keep in mind the removable top is how you exchange the filters and get to the motor. My final note is when you go to replace the filters. First off don't do it every two weeks as suggested, once a month is fine. Secondly, do not buy the filters that are already put together they are way more expensive buy the ones that you can put together, you can find them here Tetra 26160 Whisper Bio-Bag Cartridge, Unassembled, Medium, 12-Pack",1

"I used this on our extremely smart but stubborn big dog, only had to use on the lower numbers a couple of times to get the point across.  Have had no problems with the batteries or charges.  Have left the collar on and not used it for days and it was still available to make the beep noises days later.  Charges pretty quick also.",1
"This collar was great for my small dogs. (MinPin, Italian Greyhound, Chihuahua/Fox Terrier mix.) Until...the two escape artists dug out under my fence and ran amok through the neighborhood. Apparently, crawling under a fence does pull off the collars. The reflectiveness was very good. Overall, these collars were great for walking and all other activities, but I wouldn't recommend for any escape artist pooches. And for me, there are never enough bones.",1
Not very easy to hold on to.  More we use it feels sticky???  It's OK but not for us. Okay,0
"I initially thought these were going to be a little bit larger.  I guess I didn't read the fine print.  However, when we took them camping and on trips they worked out perfect.  It fits just the right amount of food in one and the size is perfect for water because if the bowl gets knocked over then you aren't losing as much water to the ground.",1

"This catnip makes my cats way more mental than any catnip I've ever gotten at the store. When it arrived, I doled some out that evening. My one cat decided that this was THE STUFF. She lost her mind. She mind-controlled me (as she does) to give her more. Then she proceeded to lose her mind some more.

This catnip has a much stronger scent than store catnip. It must be good stuff; the kitties seem to think so. It doesn't do anything for me, but I can tell it sure smells really strong.

So, I don't enjoy it myself, but the cats are finding it AMAZING.",1
I have it for couple months now and it has oxide in the blade,0
"I have no earthly way of knowing if these things work or not. Obviously, they are made for cats, not humans, and I can't smell a thing. They haven't seemed to have helped (nor hurt) my cats. I won't be buying more.",0

Too big for cats. Takes a lot of space,0
Leash works well. The retracting strap portion is not as wide as that on other retractable leashes.  Works absolutely great on 60 pound dogs but I'm not sure I would recommend this leash for a 100 pound dog.  I'll certainly buy another of this leash unless I end up with a malamute.,1
"These cost double or triple at wall mart or pet stores and they are the same thing! Love them! I have 3 for my Doxie mixes and they have been a life saver in potty training and preventing puppy destruction to my home. My pups each have their own ""room"" and go in there without being asked to many times a day for alone time. When we leave we say ""go to your room"" and they all run the their crates. I don't know that crate training works for every dog but so far all my dogs have loved it. I foster so I have allot of spare crate just in case and I have yet to meet a dog that doesn't take to crate training!",1
"I think they are actually working to keep my dog's breath fresh - which is amazing to me.  I use them sparingly, about one every 3 days or so, but it is doable and I don't have to try to brush his teeth which we both found, well, unpleasant sums it up. Thank you Milkbone!",1

"Halo used to be a great company...but, unfortunately, they have gone down hill and changed their formulas.

"This hammock is the best! Hides my white labs white hair? Check. Soft? Oh yeah. Fancy looking? That's a tea drinking, pinky up hell yeah. Drawbacks? Maybe.

We have tried the new version two different times and both times my cat got very ill (bad diarrhea and then quit eating for nearly a full week and very lethargic each time, which resolved right away when putting him back on the previous version, also the only food he wants which is apparently no longer available.
We used to adore this catfood for 7+ years until this latest switch. We would love to request the old version as per the listing here, but we're told it is impossible for any contact to be made from Amazon's support team to the Amazon warehouse.
After writing to Wellness and the changes stated to us by their customer service rep Barbara as follows:

""The Cassia Gum and Xanthan Gum was added to replace the Carrageenan. We decided to remove the fruits and vegetables to make the products even tastier, more attractive for cats, since cats crave meat.  We left the high quality protein, the cranberries (since we believe in supporting urinary tract health in cats) and also the carrots, since they were a visual and textural chunk in the pate, and we did not want to alter the mouth feel of the product, since cats are very texture driven. We have also made some nutritional updates to these recipes for they were about 10 years old.""

If someone responsible for this listing could PLEASE respond and let me know how on God's green earth to request an available case of the old version this cat parent would be endlessly grateful, omg.

"I use Filter Fiber to polish the water now and again.  It did a good job.  Is cheap and easy to replace.  The only issues is now and again a little piece will escape in your tank.

"Just received my X-Large dog door. So disappointed. I've used dog doors for 15 years. I've always purchased XL doors for my XL German Shepherds. Guess I should have paid attention to the measurements. This door is for dogs up to 90 lbs, it's the 1st thing I saw when I opened the bag. You'd think that tidbit would have been included in the description of the dog door on the website. So bummed. The door looks great and the price was great but it's of no use to me as my smallest dog is 100 lbs.",0
Every one and a while the pups get into something and these clean it right off their coats. The smell isn't very strong or repulsive and the dogs seem to think it's a game when I'm trying to clean off what every they got into.,1
"I love this cat litter! After adopting 2 grown cats recently, I decided I needed to find a healthy, natural alternative to traditional clay litter. In the past month I have tried just about every type of natural litter out there, including corn litter, paper pellets, and wood pellets. The corn litters I tried were ok as far as performance, but they didn't clump very tightly and I learned that some cats have become sick from aflatoxin that may be found in corn based litters. Next I tried paper pellets, which became a a soggy, disgusting mess with only a few uses. Then there were the pine pellets, which my cats seemed to like ok but again, they break down into soggy, wet sawdust which really needs to be sifted out with a special litter box. Also, because the pellets are quite large, cat feces stayed exposed, which meant no odor control whatsoever. I thought I was doomed to using a sub par cat litter for the sake of my cats' health, until I tried the Okocat Soft Step on a whim. Having never heard of it, I wasn't very hopeful that it would be everything I was looking for in a cat litter, but it is! It is a natural, safe cat litter that clumps tightly, scoops very easily, is dust free, and provides good odor control. I love that it's biodegradable and my cats seem to really like the texture. The Soft Step reminds me a bit of instant oatmeal in size and appearance, so it has a ""diggable"" quality that allows my cats to easily cover up their business when they are finished. The ONLY downside to this litter is that it does track A LOT because it is so lightweight. For me, this isn't a huge issue because I vacuum the area around the boxes frequently and I have a large litter mat. It also helps that my boxes are in my basement so there's plenty of opportunity for any little pieces to fall off their feet before they make it up into the main house. For me, the trade-off between tracking and healthy, natural, EFFECTIVE cat litter is completely worth it! My cats and I are all very happy with Okocat Soft Step! I won't be using anything else!",1
Great brush. Our puppy seems to love it. Also became her favorite chew toy.,1
I got it for my cat after buying a neck tie from the same company. It looks absolutely adorable. My only suggestion is to put the velcro closure on the back as it is on the neck tie.,1
"Collar works great.  While I still like the versatility of an in ground system, this wireless system works as promised and certainly keeps our chocolate lab in the yard.",1
"I bought this for my little rescue shih tzu as he eats so fast. It did helped to slow him down some, but not much. But he likes the dish and it works OK, we could have used a smaller dish tho.",1
Love love love sancho and lola's closet.....their service was perfect and my pet was so happy with the bully sticks. Top quality....Thank you!,1
"Took over a month to see results, which were great, however it yellowed my water!  Will not purchase again...",0
"We have two ragdoll cats and they are bigger cats.  It works well for them and the litter does not get kicked out like it did with one without a cover.  They were used to having an open container, so we do not use the flipper door.",1
"I got this plant some time ago, and at first I did not care for it.  It's dense and clumps together, which helps it look more real, but it doesn't flow in the water current very well.  I ended up putting it in my Jack Dempsey breeding tank. I buried the bottom and folded the top over this large rock in my tank and made a dense plant bed. needless to say, the fry that have hatched love it.  I would think it would also provide great cover for other small fish. So if you need a plant for this purpose, look no further.  If you are looking for a large plant to flow in the current, try the bamboo.",1
Same product I get at Petsmart or Complete Petmart...just A LOT cheaper.,1
"My rating reflects no disrespect to the cause, however these are horrible dog Frisbee's.  It is possible to make small Frisbee's that fly nicely, I have a few tattered ones of one type that I unfortunately have not been able to find anywhere.  And the ""Soft Bite Floppy Disc"", while not as soft to catch and aerodynamic as with the design of my tattered two, is not too bad as it flies tolerably and the ring is soft enough for a small dog.  But this item sold here is totally unsuitable able for large dogs due to it's small size, and absolutely worthless for small dogs.  Their larger Frisbee may be ok for large dogs, but they made these small Frisbee's with the same type and size of outer ring as they use for their larger Frisbee, huge, hard, and heavy. It is like the small ""Chuckit Paraflight"" in this respect, except that the ring on the Chuckit is not nearly as heavy as in this Frisbee.  Even the Chuckit is a poor choice for small dogs due to the weight and hardness of it's ring, notwithstanding the ring not being nearly as hard and heavy as with this Frisbee.  Due to the weight it does not float, you have to throw it hard to make it fly, so your small dog could never catch up to it due to the speed you have to sling it out and how fast the item drops.  And even if you do just sort of lightly toss it close and high in the air, the dogs don't want to catch it because the outer ring will hurt the mouth of a small dog.  I wondered why the small versions of these Frisbee's were so hard to find, now I know that is due to them being worthless. Yes I am sure a small amount of the revenue goes to research, but still I expect such items to be usable items.",0
Don't be an idiot like me and ignore the reviews. I ordered it and it worked well for about a week and now it will not hold a charge at all. The collar won't even turn on after being plugged in for hours. I have tried everything I can think of but this thing does not want to charge. Don't waste your time and money.,0
"This is my favorite cat litter, eliminates the smell very well for about a week after each fresh changeover. I also like it because you don't get that dust in the air that you get with clay cat litter.",1
"It's good, but I like the design of the plastic one better. The plastic one also holds more water too.",1
Great pen for my rabbits. They have no pet store cage since they're too small and they chew on things they're not supposed to so this is a great way to keep them in a certain area when I'm not home. Great investment and very affordable.,1
Very good,1
Our male shelter cat had constipation issues ever since we adopted him and would not eat any of the vet reccomended high fiber dry or wet cat foods...But he loves these and they do the trick ! I just break one in 2 with his food in the morning and another one with his food at dinner and he's become normally regular...Love this product and will continue to buy !,1
"It's not that I hate it, but my dogs do. I'm back to ordering Merrick, Fromm, Dogswell and Castor canned. They may be more expensive, but I don't wind up giving them away. The Malti and Malti mix both turned up their noses, and the Great Pyrenees just said no after the 2nd or 3rd can. Too bad. Seemed like a good product.",0
My puppy rejected it from the moment he smelled it tried to get him to taste and finally got him to bite it chewed once and spit it out and never touched it again maybe just my dog but this wasn't for me he loves other treats though,0
"This is BEYOND CUTE! It fits my 7-8 lb Yorkie perfectly, as with most 1pc outfits, the length is the concern. This is well made, just like anything you'd buy elsewhere. Its a great price  & most of all, it'll keep him warm while being stylishly cute on those cold winter nights. I'm already trying to find this in other (Boyish) colors!",1
"I was recommended this product for my snakes, but they won't touch them. Otherwise, came on time and was a good buy compared to going to the store.",0
"Awesome product.  My dog loves them.  I have a Westie.  They only last a couple of months, but I get one he is out of control in love with it.",1
These bags are worth the price.  You get a lot of them for your money.  I know there are thicker bags out there but not worth spending the extra cash.  I've tried both and these work great!,1
Peace of crap worked for about five mins it's a waste of money,0
"This is a pretty good cat tree for small kittens, but am a little skeptical as my kitty gets bigger. He almost knocks it over when he pounces up to the top, but by placing a 25 lb weight on the base really helped with that problem. The hanging ball is a bit of a safety hazzazd.  I had to cut it off one day when he got  it tangled up around one of his paws. My furniture loves the twine wrapped up around the base because he has with some training started using it instead of the furniture.",1
"I LOVE this product.  First off, it's cute n' bright, and I love the high-tech/high visibility colors used on the tent.  Second, this thing is SO EASY TO ASSEMBLE.  I'm jealous because my small ""people"" tent takes twice as long to put up.

The XL tent is really roomy, which was a concern of mine before I got the tent. I have an 80lb Black n' Tan/Retriever Mix (translation: Adorable and Clumsy), and there's enough room for him to walk in and turn around a couple times before he settles down.  Also, I just adopted another dog (small/medium size mixed bread) and she fits nicely inside too. They both have plenty of room to get comfy without feeling crowded.

There's no tent flaps, which I like. As I have rescue dogs, I sometimes worry about one of them feeling cramped or confined to a small, unfamiliar space. My dogs can freely walk in and out of the tent and the structure of the tent holds steady without feeling comprised or wobbly.

The tent packs up very well, and comes with a carrying case, tent tie, tent posts, and tent poles. The spots for the tent posts are a pretty sturdy plastic attached to the tent body.  All of these items re-pack nicely into the carrying case, which has a pull-string style closure at the top, and a carrying handle.  The weight of all this is just barely lighter than the lightest weight summer tent I've ever used for a human, so not too bad!

But I don't plan on saving this tent for camping trips only.  My Dogs accompany me on photo shoots, craft fairs, festivals, flea market/bazaar events, and community events.  Our local SPCA has an all day dog event and i plan to bring this with me as a ""rest place"" for one of my dogs to retire to when it gets ""too busy"".

All in all, I really dig this tent, and I've already kept it as a stand-by in the back of my SUV for whenever I take my pets out!",1
Was an amazing food. Made my cats healthy and energetic. Company decided to suddenly quit making it without warning and now I have to quickly find a new food without the old one to mix in to prevent them from getting sick.,0
"It wasn't very good.  The hair stuck in the glove and it did little other than ""pet"" the cat.",0
I really had high hopes for the bacon bone. My dachshund doesn't seem to be interested in this at all. He'd rather chew on his silicon chew toy. I left him in the crate with the benebone for hours and NOTHING happened.,0
"First time using this on my dog who has fleas. That same night my wife notice him having behaviors and now he is shaking, has difficulties walking and is inactive and lethargic. I have already contacted the vet the following morning for him to be examined, but in the interim looked online for similar cases with other pet owners. To my suprise, there are lots of them and Seargent's has been all so ever slow to respond to the numerous incidents that have already occurred. So be careful, think twice and go through your vet first.",0
"This is the indoor potty control solution for your dog! My Chi puppy was potty pad trained but began shredding and eating them around 5 months. This was not only messy...but of more concern dangerous material for a pet to ingest. This incredible ""potty tray"" was introduced to her with a previously ""used"" pad and quickly became her new go to bathroom spot. She loves it! Her area and her paws stay clean. The potty pad cannot be dislodged as the mesh tray locks in place until you are ready to change it. And changing it is a breeze. It is easy to wipe clean for routine maintenance and also easy to run under water for deep cleaning. A true win for you and your pet. You will not be disappointed.",1
"We previously had the Tetra Waterfall Globe which was pretty, until the extremely thin glass shattered in my hands during a cleaning. So... enter our new tank (and new fish, sadly our old betta met an unfortunate - not tank related - end)...

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough.",1
I stopped using this immediately after just one use.  My thought this would curb my dogs bark.  However when it goes off after an initial beep of a morning my dog is jolted by the electricity and doesn't realize that its being punished for barking.  Rather it continues to yelp and cry which set off the bark collar even more.  My dog was crying and convulsing.  I do not recommend this rather i recommend good behavior and reward training.  I personally use K9Bros treats which seems to stop my dog from barking everytime!,0
"Much smaller than expected. Also, it was blue and not black as the picture showed. Very high back though.",0
Small but still OK for my Golden Retriever. Folds up small for pockets,1
"The submersible feature is great, but the 22in version isn't that bright even with the setting turned all the way up.

Also the white color is actually a light blue... see picture....I was looking forward to this light but I must say I feel a little disappointed.",0
Worked great!,1
NOT IMPRESSED!  DEALT WITH GENTLEMAN AT COMPANY TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.,0
Looks very comfortable on my dog. Easy to put on,1
"After having it for 30 seconds, the squeaker stopped working. Cooper is so disappointed! Waste of $$$ !",0
"My puppy still freaked out every time I left. However, my vet recommended it to me, so I'm sure it really does work for me. Worth the price on the off chance it would work.",0
This is great for our furry baby.. hes 75lbs and hes a golden but perfect fountain for big dogs,1
"All 3 of my dogs who are typically pigs when it comes to this stuff, unfortunately really aren't liking it to the point they don't touch it at all :/",0
"The product and assembly are easy enough. But that's about the only good thing about this product.
My cat absolutely hated it and refused to use it and instead decided to pee in front of the toilet. That said, maybe it was a fear of falling in the toilet because the plastic is so incredibly cheap and flimsy.
Back to the litter box we go.",0
"My dog played with it for 10-15 & the squeaker doesn't work anymore. She'll still play with it, but it's a bummer.",0
My fur babies love them,1
"These outfits are too small, my chihuahua can't fit it.",0
This mit takes the dirt and mud off my two dogs without water and easily and quickly.  Love it!,1
Perfect! I love the hidden brackets that are long enough my cats won't break the shelves jumping wildly on them.  My cats are big and strong as they are bengals!  Best cat shelves yet!,1
"This worked great for my two 12 lb poodles. I bought two cages and they fit in the back of my 2010 Prius when the seats are down. I like that the dogs can see out the windows and see each other. Also, it's not so hot because the open bars let more of the AC in. I like that I can fold them down in seconds and put them away until the next time I need them.",1
Didn't last an half an hr with my has pup,0
This works good to give water to my cat. When I set it up it usually lasts a good 3 days.,1
New food for my dog with allergies and picky appetite. I am just so happy she likes it!,1
The pads are very absorbent and don't drip.  I wish they were bigger.,1
"My dog loved this toy and he got a lot of use out of it.  The only problem is the he shredded it the whole time.  It was a disaster within hours.  The rubber is like a cheap dollar store sqeek toy.  He still wanted to play with it, but almost choked on a loose piece, so we had to throw it away.  Not worth the money.",0
"lenses fell out just getting them out of the package, not to mention when stretched over dogs eyes",0
Not what I thought this product would be.  I thought it would be a lot larger than it is.,0
I have an oval toilet and this system is for a round toilet. There's no way to make the system fit my oval toilet so I will be returning it. The idea seems sound though,0
This helps me keep my mail cat from being too mean to his sister.,1
My cat loves these i did not understand why it entertains her so much but this is so cheap and this is the only thing she will play with.,1
My cat just likes getting these outta the 16 hole cat box toy. Afterwards he lines them up on the floor like their trophys.,1
We live in southern california and the days can get very warm.  My two Havanese love the extra shade over the bed to enable more time outdoors.,1
"MY dog is 28 lbs got her an XL and it fits her great

The white dog is about 20 lbs and the XL is baggy on him but still cute",1
"No, it didn't stay together. Falls apart no matter what I do. It was easy to install though.",0
I was led to believe that it would be two scratching posts (a carpet post and a sisal post) which would be perfect for placing in two separate areas of the house. I was excited because of the price but was extremely disappointed when I received it 10 minutes ago in the mail. Returning mine for a refund. It wasn't the great deal I was led to believe.,0
"The bowl is plastic.
The light is made cheap and does NOT work.",0
Happy customer. Birds loving it.,1
Great clippers at such great price,1
Piece of Crap Was Broken When I Set it up Air Line Under The Shell Was Broken Air Leaked out in Wrong Area Don't Buy This Garbage.,0
"So easy, so efficient.  Really works and cuts the cleaning job down to nothing!",1
Soooo cute :),1
"This product is safe and can be used often. I spray my dog, and then spread the liquid all over his coat with my hands (no toxic chemicals). When the fleas become visible, I pick them out and make sure they're dead. I've been doing this for the past 3 days now and the itching and scratching has stopped. I recommend this product for regular maintenance.

I LOVE the smell of this product. Peppermint & Clove!",1
"Don't waste your money. Had no fleas. Used this product as a preventative. Fleas everywhere- and  we have an INSIDE ONLY cat!! Now we'll have to flee bomb the whole house, which is not something I want to do.
Update your Advantage product Bayer!",0
"Love these. Super sturdy and keeps the bowls from being moved around by my male cat! It also keeps water off the floor!! They are super cute. Im nervous they make take a little extra effort to clean off, since the scales create a lot of ridges but Im sure it will come off nicely based on the material.",1
"My 15 week old puppy loved this toy, but after about a week I discovered she was chewing the fabric patches off of the bear and apparently swallowing them.",0
"the mat is extremely thin, like a very thin table mat.",0
Not even close to the right fit unless she was a horse. Much larger than meaurement guide.,0
Came just as advertsied. Brand new. Not a scratch or dent on it! Packed extremely careful too!,1
"My baby is so happy with his antler, he just loves it.",1
"I love the sweater, however it does run long. My boy is a solid 72lbs. with a broad chest.
He needed the xx-large to fit his chest, but sweater extends about 2"" beyond the top of his tail. Luckily, the sweater bunches up a bit on his back. So, it all works. My boy likes wearing the sweater. This sweater could use another fastener just beyond the rib cage, it would fit more snug.
I get many compliments on the sweater, it does look great on my dog. I do like the material.
Would I buy it again? Well, only if I bought the large..This sweater does stretch out a bit.
Hope this helps.",1
"I wanted to like this product but unfortunately my cat won't get near it. She refused to even give it a lick. I also attempted to sneek a few pieces in with her regular dry food, no go! I even put a small amount with some wet food and she picked around it.",0
"This fountain is so much better than the original Drinkwell fountain.  Easier to clean, easier to assemble and quieter.  Highly recommend.",1
Works just as described.,1
"all grooming gloves . if you have short  haired dog do not waste your money, will not work",0
"Nice idea, but not worth the money.  You can make your own cushions or just put in a pet bed.",0
My Yorkie wouldn't touch these for nothing. :( Her regular brand had been discontinued and been on the search for something that would work and she will eat. This wasn't for her.,0
"I do not recommend this product for cats. While it stays on, my kitten has developed scabs on her ears due to the rubbing against the rough  fabric of the cone while she walks.  This is the same cone the vet gave me. So buyer beware.",0
These were poorly produced and contained only about 25% of the charcoal in the filters that they should have had.  One set is completely unsealed on one end.  The fit is off and the filter has to be forced into the frame.  No good at all.  I'd return them but I really need them.,0
Save your money and buy something else. This thing never worked properly. I had Amazon exchange it and had the same issue. Not to mention that if this is for a cat they can easily manipulate the lid/tray to get food from the next compartment.,0
"Wellness canned cat food is not the weight stated on the can. This wet food is sold by weight, NOT volume. Something fishy is going on. The meat part of last four cans I opened were very small (I have pictures, and weights). I was surprised, so weighed the rest of the cans in the case. They range from 3.8 ounces to 5.1 ounces. This food is not cheap, and even if it were, I would expect it to BE the weight stated on the can. Unreal, but not really surprising.",0
This is a very small blanket.  Not what I expected.,0
"My 14 pound Boston Terrier loved this toy when I pulled it out of the packaging. Unfortunately, within a short while of playing with it, she was able to pull off one of the colored rubber strips. Luckily I found it and was able to grab it before she choked on it. The strips are glued on not sewn so she found it easy to remove it.",0
I was afraid my 1 year old cat was going to fall through the bottom.,0
All but two of our chickens died after eating this food.,0
Great product,1
Works very well. It makes me feel at ease when I cut around my dog's eyes since sometimes they can get jittery.,1
"High quality, looks great, and suitable for most small dogs. Pomeranian owners might want to hang the tag on the collar or use a service vestinstead. It can be difficult to see the tag if your dog has a lot of fur and the tag is on the back side of the harness.",1
"have ordered a number of times... dogs love the snacks!!  I have 2 larger coonhounds that will not play ball so to ""challenge"" them, I hide these snacks around the yard so that they can use their inherent gift of scent tracking.  The ""game"" keeps them busy for at least 30 minutes.  In the winter, I will toss these in the snow and let them find them.",1
"Filter might be OK, if I received all of it. This thing was sent to me twice, both times with missing parts. Both were missing the air tube and the spout that is supposed to create the venturi effect and draw in the air. I did not realize that without those parts this filter does not aerate the water at all, even if it squirts water out like a fountain. Long story short, a dozen of my neons suffocated. I am extremely upset.",0
it's to heavy...even after cats pee.  scooping is heavy...won't use it again,0
"I use these in my dog collars.  They last a long time, and fit perfectly!  I am so glad I found this product, because buying them from the company that sells my dog collars are nearly triple the price!",1
"It works very well to keep our dog from entering the room or area we put one of these ""Zones"". I highly recommend this if you want to keep your dog away from those areas. It seemed a little hard to set up for an open area, as the ""stated distance"" was not real good.",1
I am fussy about the feel of a leash and always want leather and a rust proof bronze snap. This leash is just the right weight...solid in your hand without being too big or rough. It is strong enough and durable and it is nicely woven and finished. I highly recommend it.,1
great,1
One of my dogs' favorite treats.,1
"I bought this over a year ago for my cats to lounge on and they LOVE it!!

it washes beautifully and dries (in the dryer) in no time.
once dry, it looks somewhat 'shaggy', but I just give it a quick brushing with a (pet) slicker brush and that makes it look and feel as silky soft as the day it arrived.
there is very little fuzz coming out in the brush, so don't be shy 'grooming' it!

the suade-like backing is perfectly sewn onto the fake fur and lays smooth without any crumples.

I wish it would come in red, ~ I'd buy another one!",1
"Very well build, good quality fur. It fits a little loosely around my cats, but they are fairly small and should fit a bigger cat just fine. The cats don't particularly like having it on their head, so seeing it on them for extended periods of time is rare.",1
"These colors are great. Chain is heavy so not for little dogs . I think the size is a little small or true to size and I need to get bigger size.
Sure like them.",1
"Well, I meant to get the squeaky one (that's my fault). My dogs won't touch it. They just don't like it at all. It is really hard and my dogs (80lb pit bull and 15lb Border Collie) love the squeaky toys. I just can't seem to find one that can survive the two of them for more than a week.",0
the material is very weak and easily broken,0
"Looks awesome once built, took time to build, and after a few months my cats peed on sides inside. I used contact paper liner to begin eith all the way around on the inside as others suggested, but eventually the pee seeped into the wood and the box smelled. I was not able to wipe off the smell of urine which permeated the entire box after months.",0
"Our little Miss is a lab mix about 40 lbs and a medium chewer. She had this apart and tore to shreds in an hour. She loved it and danced around to get the second one we had bought. So two hours of play and an hour of clean up and Vacuuming (then cleaning strings from vacuum lol) is worth 13 dollars to you these for you. To me was not worth the money when I have paid less for ones that lasted longer. Now mine did look like picture and was very cute is why they got two stars, but didn't stand up to play.",0
"Used this on my 20 lb Shiba Inu. Her nail got embedded in the seam and by the time her terrified thrashing was done she had her nail ripped out and her jaw swollen from trying to free herself. Finding her in the crate covered in blood, saliva, and urine from the ordeal was a scary experience for me until I figured out what had happened. Between this and my experience with Tagg customer service, I would never, ever recommend using their products. They placed all the blame on me and refused to reimburse me for the product. Not to mention trying to cancel the subscription was a nightmare as well. Run from this sorry excuse for a company.",0
The product would not contain my German Shepard he fit in the cage but was very easy to get out. Would not buy this item again,0
cute.  washable. adjustable.,1
It's only mid August but no fleas so far this summer.  The collar went on easy and stays in place great!,1
Great size but the botton stitching came out while we were on a trip.,0
Works great in the large litter box!,1
"I loved this test kit until today I tried to test for ammonia because my cycled recently got crashed, and the number one ammonia bottle came out pale brown instead of the yellow that it usually does. I went ahead and mixed it with number 2 bottle and it just turns a darker shade of brown. I tried 3 times. The color spectrum for this test is green. The expiration date says 2021. Not even halfway through the bottle. Now I have to go spend money for another test kit, losing me money.",0
"Bought this for our female pug and she looks SO cute in it. It's soft, and it fits her perfectly. For reference, she's 10lbs and I bought a medium. It's made better than I thought it would be. So worth it.

EDIT: I'm disappointed to find that it has already torn around the neck. I think I'll be able to salvage it, but with minimal wear, this shouldn't have ripped so quickly in my opinion.",1
Great kennel! Would have been super duper if the chain link was a higher grade.,1
These are made better than I have previously purchased at pet stores. Only problem was I ordered the wrong size. Ordered the med when it should have been small so passed them on.,1
I had a warranty issue and the seller replaced the unit entirely!,1
"This is super easy to use, our dog likes it, and it has helped with her stinky breath.  It also seems to have helped make her poop less stinky and she passes gas less, so win-win.",1
"I loved the ingredients in this food, but the dogs didn't like the taste.",0
My cats hate it...otherwise good transaction,0
The bone broke off first time I put it on my dog,0
My dogs love these antlers,1
My dog doesn't like it and won't walk when I try to use it:(.,0
My goldendoodle loves this happy toy.  I don't understand everything it says but he does.,1
Works great. No issues at all.,1
"Almost immediately after putting this in my aquarium the water turned yellow and a fine layer of yellowy sludge became encrusted all over the glass of the tank. I removed the hammock, and after replacing the water and scrubbing down the aquarium glass everything was fine. My betta wasn't even interested enough in the hammock to justify the filthy water.",0
"Dog loves it and good for her, recommended by vet.",1
"This looks cute in my kitty's condo, just the right size and softness! I actually bought two, one for upper and one for lower level.",1
"Used with a non-rinse foam shampoo. Washed my cat with that & brushed her out. Used this after she was a bit dryer. Sprayed her down with this product and then brushed her out. It definitely helped helped her dandruff/dander. I highly recommend brushing your cat out with a wire brush to work it through. It really helps make the process easier and helps get a better clean/get rid of dandruff better. You might have to repeat the steps and do a couple of applications to get the desired effect. Depends on the cat & the severity of the dandruff/dander. I highly recommend this product, it definitely helped!",1
What marketing idiot decided to use cardboard as a scratching post? My 2 cats grew up with a similar product and because of it were conditioned to think that ANY cardboard was OK to scratch. Every cardboard box in my house has been destroyed because of this. I suggest using a post made out of anything else but cardboard.,0
Mainly made of corn meal. Geez.,0
"Even though the litter was freshly poured into the litter pan, the cats preferred to use our bathtub instead :( it occurred 3 times until we bought a different litter, which was actually just store brand.",0
Our cat Stella LOVES this beaver.,1
does not seem to work. She hates to eat them. Must hide in taste food,0
Amazing product.,1
"This is a nice dish for my sun conure. It's easy for him to hold onto while drinking and he loves to take a bath. I wish it was a little bigger, but he enjoys it just the same.",1
"I like the colors, but I don't believe the product matches the price tag.  I had purchased a similar bag from another source, and it was much thicker and sturdier.  The material is a bit flimsy.",0
My fish practically begs for food when I feed him this. I also use NLS food (which is equally if not better for your fish) but I found these useful in the event I needed to have the food float 100% of the time. (NLS sometimes sinks quickly),1
My cat loves it,1
"This did not calm our Lab down.  In fact, the poor guy had the worst case of diarrhea.  I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because we stopped giving him the treat after day 2, and I believe something like this has to build up in the animal.",0
Seem the same as the 12 inch I usually buy. Convenient to pack to travel.,1
"did not last for too long, stopped shocking, buttons work when they feel like it",0
I like it but its too big for my puppy right now.  Keeping it until she gets bigger.  I'm using the xSmall one right now?,1
"120 pound Caucasian Ovcharka.  Very good swimmer.  This jacket is a hazard to your pet.  This product was simply never tested by the manufacturer.  There are plenty of good vests out there.  This is not one of them.

Two main failures:

1) Underside buoyancy flips dog on its side or back.

2) Jacket will slip lot on the dog causing its rear end to float and forcing its nose into the water.  The fix to this is to tighten the vest to the point that it constrains the dog from raising its head to keep it out of the water.",0
"However it wasn't quite right for my dog, he still showed anxiety and eventually got to the point of shaking.",1
"I raise and show poodles and am also a groomer. A HUGE problem is grooming during the Winter and dealing with static making hair stand straight out.
When properly diluted, Magic Touch can be lightly misted into the coat and brushed dry. The hair will be left soft and healthy and all static will be gone. There is never any residue left over nor is it ever sticky.
At a bit less diluted, Magic touch is also great for removing any hair spray after a show before the hair is banded.
As for regular pet grooming, the coat is left feeling wonderful and smelling great. Choppy clipping which can result from a too dry coat is never an issue when Magic Touch is used prior to using the clippers.",1
"Washed the cover one time, the zipper came apart and the cover will not zip now. Not quality material at all and you cannot find a replacement cover due to its odd size.",0
It is bad. The bag is broken & ants inside.,0
"My dogs are picky about treats.  Forget the biscuits, they are meat eaters.  We have bought other freeze dried products, but when I read the reviews on these natural raw, freeze dried checked nuggets, I decided to try them.  I really like that they are made in the USA.  I give my dogs 1-2 per day as a snack and they come running when they hear me open the bag.  There are quite a few of those little square nuggets in the bag, so I expect that it will last for quite a while.  If my dogs could use the computer, they would be re-ordering them right now.",1
"I like the food but the shipping took longer then I expected. It should never take up to two weeks to receive anything but special order products. I assume this is mass produced, so it should be delivered within a week tops.",1
"Our dog gets lots of compliments, I like that it's rechargeable and bright. Great for evening walks!",1
"The content never produced a foam. I have contacted seller, they recommended to shake it before use. Obviously I have tried that before and after advice - no change. I do not know if this is the problem with my bottle or the product itself.",0
This is an extremely cheap product. It has almost zero structural integrity and is composed of rigidity plastic. I wouldn't recommend it for the price.,0
Color was not pink kind pf orangish but still great,1
"This bed is fine for a young dog's day bed, but I was expecting it to be a bit sturdier. I use it as an extra bed for the office, but I wouldn't consider it thick enough for an all night bed. I just realized I am that kind of dog owner. Lucky dogs, I guess!",0
"I bought these drops to help my 7 year old cat accept the new cat. I rescued a feral cat about a year ago. She's doing awesome but my 7 year old hates her. I was hoping these drops would calm her. No luck. I'm using the book called ""cat vs cat"". and tips from the show called ""my cat from hell ""  Making some progress. Also using a calming collar.  In fairness to this product my cat was too stressed for a few drops of this stuff to help her.",0
"Careful what you ask for. I wasn't sure how soon I'd need my next bag of food since I store it in a sealed bin. Just finally opened the box the bag came in and the bag had a huge hole in it.

Tried to save myself money, but ended up costing me more since I have to toss this and go buy a fresher bag...",0
"I've been an advantage fan for 15 years but this product is awful. Why are these companies always changing things.  If it's not broken,  why fix it?

It's nuts,  my cat doesn't even leave my home and my dog only goes out to potty.",0

"This collar was advertised for cats so I thought it would fit my chihuahua. The lenght fit around the neck, but it was very wide...way too big for her. When I ordered it, it said it was shipped with prime, but when I tried to return it, it said free shipping, so I would have had to pay to send it back. I'm disappointed with the product and advertising.  On the bright side, I gave it to my neighbor and it fit her 20-25 lb.  Boston Terrier.",0
Band size isn't consistent and lose enough to move up and down while you're working... sometimes slowly sometimes too quickly to where it spins off.,0
It always gets here very quickly. And Stanley seems to like it.  :),1
"Exactly as described. Very sturdy for my
German Shepherd! And it's a great size.",1
Our dog had this tore up in 5 minutes.  He was able to get it loose way to quickly.,0
"I've always liked Booda domes - These smaller ones are easy to scoop, easy to wash out, and easy to fill and carry around. I don't bother with the filters, just scoop every day or two. Not all cats like covered litter boxes, so I have other boxes without tops, but most of my cats seem to prefer this one anyway. It's a nice size for fitting into a bit smaller space, too, like the corner of a bathroom. Even so, my fattest cat has no trouble getting in/out of it.",1
Good product but get a ruler out so you understand the size first.,1
My dog got sick and ended in the hospital,0
"Please, if you love your pet , DO NOT FEED!!

"Oh My... So I got some pills for my cats to take care of the adult fleas, and got these sentry flea drops to help keep them off. The pills worked fantastic, the drops, the world may never know...
I opened up the tube, and started parting my cats hair. He sniffed the tube and scurried off. I got ahold of him and started to apply the drops. As soon as 1 drop hit his skin, he meowed very loudly, and hissed at me. Hes never ever given me any kind of attitude before, when applying drops, even takes a real bath. So i was very surprised by this. All the sudden the smell hit me. My eyes started to water, and my cat was blinking hard as if something was in his eyes, even though im 100% certain I only got it on the knap of his neck.
The drops have a very strong repulsive smell, that reminds me of acetone. Since flea season never ends in FL, I did end up trying to get more on him before I realized he wasn't liking the drops. At first I thought he wasn't liking the process of getting it on, as he has a serious case of fleas. I thought maybe he was tender from all the scratching. Anyway, he weighs 15 pounds, and i managed to get about 30% of the tube on him. (The tube says for 5#s and up). Im hoping that it still works, but Im throwing away the other 5 tubes, and will find another product.
I had seen reviews concerning the smell, and reactions. However they were old, so i had hoped sentry had taken care of those problems.
Trying to buy budget friendly flea drops so close to Christmas is going to cost me more in the end. Buyer beware.",0
it did not work at all. my dogs at the poop just like they did before I gave them FOR-BID. a total waste of money.,0
Works great! Could see it working killing the fleas instantly,1
"One of my cats favorite treats. I read from the reviews they were a hit or miss, but both my cats munch these little fish down like crazy. I'm interested in the other ones but the minnows make my cats go wild. I'll throw them and they'll play with them, or just pounce and go to town.",1
"We bought the original toy at a local pet store chain it was on sale so we thought why not we have 2 chocolate lab mixes that love to shred everything this has been very durable more so then the kongs wich they just annihilated. It did only take them 2 1/2 days to eat the treat out but till my refills come i have been sticking other treats inside them and they have not broken the toy. I have been careful with what food items we give them because one of them has a sensitive stomach and even has a hard time keeping sensitive stomach non grain food down. But she did not get sick this is we decided to refill. The only thing i dislike, is the stink of the plastic toy it turns my stomach every time i pick it up.  All so we purchased the med size one and it works just fine for them they are about 45 lbs dogs.",1
"Great product... I wish it were a deep purple as shown in the picture.  It's more like lavender but still very nice.  But the quality is very nice, easy to use and looks good on my horse.  I just wish my horse could keep it on !!",1
My cat threw up after taking it. I really would have liked to have it work as my kitty walks stiff legged.,0
Loved it!,1
I didn't even have to open the box I could here the glass rattling around. They were bubble wrapped but no luck. Sent entire shippment back to amazon.,0
"I gave this one star, because that's the minimum I can give. It lasted 3 days before it fell apart. The stitching failed and the material ripped.",0
Lasted one week then it stopped. No matter what I do it will not work.. For me this was not worth the money.. Sad...,0
THIS COVER IS WONDERFUL.  IT KEEPS THE OUTDOOR CATS WARM AND DRY.,1
Was told about this product by my sister in law. I have one of my male cats who hides all of the time and rips his tail hair out we believe due to anxiety. When I put this on him or out into his food... there is a difference. He does not hide as much and is much more visible and relaxed. I will purchase it again.,1
Dogs love it..,1
"Perfect Size,,, Perfect Shape to reach all my puppy's teeth. She loves them",1
Place according to directions on my cat Kathy  . It was lost with in 2 days along with her quick release collar. I gave product 2 stars because it made me laugh.,0
"Came broken, doesn't stay on  and very noisy",0
Bought this because of the great reviews. Have a boxer and BostonTerrier. The Boston has been throwing up since he started eating it 4 days ago and my boxer has been gagging but not actually puking. Neither one of my dogs have ever had such a reaction to a dog food. Approximately 1-2 hours after eating they start getting sick.  Disappointed and wanted to let others know in case this is also happening with other dogs.,0
This product works great for our twelve year old yellow lab. We love that it helps her so much that we recommended it and amazon to four people who have dogs with issues and they all ordered it and tell us how it has helped their dogs. Thank you Nutramax Dasuquin and Amazon.,1
"Over a week since I treated my dog, and there is NO sign of this product working.  He is fully infested, and I have worked hard to daily de flea him, and my home.  Now I am stuck waiting for the product / poisen  to wear out of his system.  He is miserable, and so am I.",0
Works good as a comb. But doesn't get the deep down mats out!!,0
"after only a few uses the pins started coming out... and the rubber let go along the edges.
Turned out the pins with the balls on the ends are bad for Persian Cat's coats anyways.. so I was happy to throw it in the trash.",0
"Goes in and out of the car easily. Keeps my car seats and carpet free of those fibers of love and joy my Golden Retriever is constantly emitting. My dog, doesn't like anything to change. hopped right in. Highly recommend this product!",1
"Initially I loved this crate.  Light, portable and seemed durable. Unfortunately, our 25lb Irish Setter puppy pretty much has ripped it to shreds.  First the door panel screen (which I have subsequently sewed twice to repair) and now the side near the opening (which can't be repaired).  Will need to go the hard crate route now.",0
cats won't touch it. awful.,0
"Our 18month old Golden Retriever is a semi-aggressive chewer. He nearly destroyed his red Kong (regular chewer) in less than 12 months. So far, this one has held up great and he loves it! He uses it for general play (retrieving), chewing, and a busy toy (with a treat or carrot inside). I'll buy this again for sure!",1
"Not what I expected.
I wanted to cordon off an area (Bike area) where the dogs are not allowed to enter. This system keeps the dogs in, and not out.",0
"It's difficult to believe this product has as many favorable ratings as represented which in my mind raises into question their authenticity.  The plastic tabs that secure the collar to the shocking unit broke which led to the unit falling off my dog within minutes of first use.  The collar unit continuously beeps and emits erroneous shocks well within the wire boarder.  It also loses power quickly such that I can hardly feel a shocking sensation when placing my fingers on the probe.  The company was responsive to my complaint and is sending me a second collar although I am highly doubtful, based on my experience thus far, that it will perform as advertised. Given that the company is manufacturing a product that delivers a shock to an animal and requires a significant investment in time to install, one would think they would be extremely sensitive to quality control.",0
i think I got collars with no chemical in them.  They were useless.,0
Ended up buying this but not on Amazon. This should be a$5 toy. The turtle has no room in his little tank to do anything. Could create almost the same effect with a Dollar Store turtle and a mixing bowl.,0
"Very much different from the picture posted, only got one when there were more than one in the picture. Also was nothing like the picture was expecting just one long piece. When my pup carries it in his mouth sometime it pokes him in the eye.",0
"This is a great toy for fetch, but not a chew toy.  My dog loves to fetch this, but if I allow him to chew on it he will tear off an end.  Supervision is advised.",1
"I have a 9 month old 75 pound Rottweiler.
She has been walking on a leash since she was 2 months.
As she grew older and stronger controlling the walk became more
and more work. Slip leashes or traditional choke chains were not doing the job.
For the most part she is very well behaved, however when a smell
catches her attention she will jerk away from our stride to try and check it out.

I saw this type of a collar used by Cesar on ""The dog whisperer"" for dogs that need to have their tugging corrected.
Since purchasing this Sprenger collar her behavior is nearly perfect during our nightly walks.
While it looks a bit like a mid age torture device it's not. It simply distributes the force in a more productive way. Previously she
would be wheezing and gagging with the other collars, now the Sprenger there is none of that. It's a very high quality product made in Germany.
I purchased a size that she can grow into as the link's are removable, or more can be purchased then added.
Jimm....",1
Im cant say if its a good item or not because when I opened it the batteries were corroded and there was sand in the filter and on the vacuum itself  I ordered it new!,0
Works great! I bought two of them; one for my dog and one for my brother's dog. We live on 3 acres and it's nice to be able to see them outside when they go potty at night. Sometimes they'd jump the fence and now it's a whole lot easier to find them. I like how you can also charge them and they are not battery powered. My dog is about 45lbs and medium fit.,1
Actually works.,1
didn't work,0
My dog looks at us when we blow the whistle but then keeps barking at the neighbor dog. Does not deter her.,0
"I ordered a second carrier before I had even used the first one I bought, because I was impressed with the way it loaded from the top.  However, do not try to carry a large cat in it for the simple reason he will rise up when enclosed in it and force the top to open and jump out of it.  It will probably be okay for a small cat.

I am sorry I bought two of them before I tested them for safety and before I realized the snap closures for the top will not keep a large cat from bursting loose.  The top of the carrier does not fit completely down over the bottom.  It does not close tightly.",0
used it few times it does get a lot of hair off,1
The price of this item was taken out of my account twice,0
This is the stupidest toy ever.  It probably costs all of 3 cents to make.  And my cats are totally addicted to it.  Go figure!,1
Lizard is still alive.,1
These head harnesses are so cute and functional because the reflective properties. It's a shame because I love all things Kurgo for my pups. We have a border collie blue heeler mix that is constantly pulling on the leash. So this was a great idea but the harness was super easy to take off. She is smart but we couldn't get it to stay on. The middle ring is made of cheap rubber that broke on our first walk. Returned this item. Was very disappointed.,0
"I HIGHLY recommend Fruitables--she absolutely LOVES them, and there's no junk or fillers in them. Made in USA, calories are reasonable, good all-purpose size, and they smell like ""people"" cookies--much nicer to have sitting in the kitchen than, say, liver-flavored snacks.",1
"Tried it for months, could not get my puppy to go near it. It feels very unstable to her. I trashed it",0
"We have a small day and she loves it, went on vacation and she went every where with us. Worked for us Great",1
"My dog and cat both ate them and seemed to really enjoy them as treats, but there was no improvement in my dog's ""cat treat"" habit. In fact, I'm almost convinced it got worse. I was going to try to return them, but my return window closed on 1/31/18. There is a 100% money back guarantee printed on the label, so I'm going to try contacting the company directly.",0
It lasted a few months.,0
I was disappointed.  It ripped open at the seams and stuffing came out after 5 minutes.,0
Cat went wild for it!,1
"I bought two of these. One for a mild dog, another who chews compulsivley. The one who chews ate his cage in a week. The dog who doesnt still has his. If you have a bigger dog who likes to chew/shred, avoid this crate!!!",0
Omega fish oil has gone above and beyond in helping my dog w/ her auto-immune disorders. She has both Panus & Lupus and no longer takes medication to control either of them and the affects of the disorders have ceased. I just put a squirt of the oil in each meal & what a turn around! GOOD STUFF!! H,1
My puppy was not interested in this at all.  I packaged it back in the box and will return it,0
One spot I had in my carpet (fostered 12 puppies from 1 day old til about 6 weeks with their mama) has yet to come back. Bubba's is AWESOME!!!,1
"This post arrived with the rounded top part broken.  The material felt like cardboard for that piece.  It seems to have snapped in the middle during shipping as the center felt broken, but the actual medium used for the rounded part seemed like it wouldn't have held up to much.  Unfortunate, b/c the rest felt sturdy and my cats like the material.",0
"I have a little doxiepoo who is absolutely loving these Bully sticks.  They're supposed to be a Christmas present but of course, while wrapping them up I had to give her one and she's busy working on it as we speak.  There is a slight odor to them, but it's not as bad as some others that we've tried and the odor wears off after a bit.  As long as my little dog is enjoying them, that's all that matters. And that she is.",1
This is the best poop scooper we have ever owned. The large jaws and strong springs allow for easy cleanup on concrete and grass.,1
Cat likes it and uses it. We bought it to feed in rotation with other activity feeders so our cat is less bored. It seems to help. We change it up by throwing some high value treats in occasionally. we've had it a month or so and that cat still uses it. Easy to clean.  the cat doesn't push it around the room- even though he is big and we have hardwood floors.,1
What can I say about pooper scooper equipment. It does the job!,1
I had the matt almost a year and the thing ended sticking to my flore and peeling apart,0
"Buy the pricier one, it's much more worth it. This one's frame was so distorted that it didn't even sit level and it wouldn't stick to the window at all like my other one does!",0
I am so happily surprised at the difference this has made with my sick old cat. His eyes are now bright and his coat is shiny. Wow!,1
8 months after purchase and this is warping and falling apart. Wood too thin to handle outdoor weather.,0
Too sharp. It hurt cats skin.,0
Perfect shampoo for our new member to the house.,1
"I hesitated spending $$$ on this one flyer but let me tell you I am so glad that I did!!  I have had HOURS of fun with our lab puppy.  The flyer travels far with little effort and it's durability is just wonderful.  It's last for MONTHS now without wear and we literally play with it every day on our 5 acres.  Great toy, great exercise, great fun.  I never write review but felt that I needed to give one on this :)",1
"Tried this thinking it would be a high quality food based on ingredients. However after my puppy, a 5 month old Shih Tzu mix tried it he got sick and threw up in the middle of the night 4-5 times and I'm pretty certain he didn't ingest anything else. We mixed this in with his Instinct puppy food to gradually switch over to TOTW but even though he only ate a small amount it was enough to make him lethargic and so sick that he was whining and pacing around. After fasting him for 12+ hours then giving him only a bland chicken/potato/rice diet he was fine until I attempted to feed it to him again a day later, an even smaller amount of TOTW puppy food and mixed it in again with his regular food. He vomited again that evening and I couldn't think of anything else it might be. So sure enough when we took this away and started feeding him his Instinct food he was back to normal. Other than eating too quickly (I bought a slow feeder) he doesn't seem to have any other problems. I would think twice before purchasing this food, especially reading all the negative reviews as well as on dogfoodadvisor.com. There must be an ingredient in here that is making the dogs sick, Even though other people have had good experiences I wouldn't trust it after what happened.

Also noticed our other dog, 4 year old Maltese mix had some tarry looking and smelly poops after eating the Adult TOTW ""roasted fowl"" just an observation but I also stopped feeding her that to prevent anything from happening. You never know.

I recommend Acana, Open Farm or Instinct. We've fed them to our dogs with no problems great results!",0
My pups a picky eater and liked these!!,1
"We purchased this after it was recommended.  We have a golden doodle ....so lots of curly fur to clean.
We get many compliments on how good our dog smells, even a few weeks after her bath.  When she gets wet, it reactivates the scent.",1
Flat as a pancake. Needed to put a folded up comforter underneath it.,0
"I've bought a few of these Googlie toys now and my dog, Frank, LOVES them! I'm not sure if it's the squeaking or the texture of the toy, but he absolutely loves these toys!

My dog Daisy loves this food and it's good for her.,1
"The best for your birds. Took a little bit for my lovebirds to convert, but I could tell in their stools that they were actually getting nutrients. I mix it with a little seed for a balanced diet. No sunflower seeds. My birds don't need Big Macs. Lol",1
Had to clean it every one to two days to keep slime from forming on the water. Very time-consuming to clean; eventually became fed up with all the extra work. Missed the return deadline. Very disappointed.,0
"we bought 2.... omgeez, so cute",1
Love this thing - perfect for bringing my dog to the beach at night,1
It broke within seconds,0
"Please, please don't buy this. A fish shouldn't be a toy, and even if you took the best possible care of the betta (daily water changes, high-quality food, a plant to further clean the water) the betta would still spend its time floating motionless, or, despite everything, die from bad water. Bettas are incredibly hardy fish, but they still need at least two gallons to do well, and five should be the minimum if you ever want to see it move, don't want its fins to rot, or don't want to change the water daily. You really should buy a ten-gallon or larger tank and put it in with a few other fish.
I gave the educational value a three because I hope the kids who get this will learn something after the fish has died.
(For anyone wondering, the pet stores that display signs claiming bettas live in puddles of water this big in the wild are lying. Betta don't exist in the wild, they're bred, and even they can't survive in these tanks for long)",0
My dog and my daughters dog did not like these. . They like a chewier treat. These are too soft. Baby seven and Josie,0
"This device is really great.  I hope this was invented by some regular lady or guy and they made a million bucks off it.  You could probably DIY something, but it's well made, and while it comes with all the essential bits, you can buy various other kinds of random attachments if you want.  Saves a ton of time and labor - it'll just funnel the dirty water into my garden outside, and then I can hook it up to my utility sink and refill my tanks after adjusting the water temp at the tap.",1
I purchased a Ruff & Tuff Heavy Duty chew toy for my 3yr old Rottweiler (partially because a rott was shown on the advertisement.  Well he had it torn apart and partially eaten in less than 5 minutes.  I have tried to contact the company and they will not respond.  Not worth the money,0
"My old cat LOVED this, but our newer cats won't touch it.",0
"Same quality as those at the pet store, but the price on Amazon was unbeatable!
High quality product, plenty of room for my 35 lb. dog to move about when we were not home and still house training him. Easy to clean removable tray, two side doors and one top door make feeding and water replacement a cinch.",1
"My dog is usually super excited about squeaky toys, but he did not care about this one at all.  Plus, it is just really strange looking.",0
Safe and sharp scissors. Works great on my little Bichon which requires a lot of grooming.,1
My dog LOVES this brush.  He doesn't want me stop and usually rolls over to let me brush his belly.  Great quality and it removes a lot of excess fur.,1
Great product. Lightweight and easy to put on plus it looks great.,1
"C'mon man!  This product is supposed to be a flea control and prevention treatment for kittens.  It doesn't work very well.  In fact, there are more fleas on my cat now than before I put this on.  What a total waste of money.  It seems like cat fleas are immune to this treatment, or might even like it.  Don't buy this or else you will be upset like me.",0
The crate was the park size for my 3 year old German Shepard/husky mix. He has a lot of energy and somehow breaks the door off of the crate every time he is left in there. We are still trying to crate train him but hes a little older so beware. If your dog is sneaky and smart he will find a way to get out.,0
"Size fits well, but they do not hold up against cats with nails. It was like not having a liner at all.",0
Our 13 lb. Shih Tzu loves these treats and I feel good about giving them to him being made in America.,1
Good size (60-70lb dogs) and easy fit. Installed in metal exterior door. Dogs took to it after a few tries. I used silicone where the 2 sides come together on the inside. I didn't want any water infiltrating. The magnets don't hold very well in windy conditions but pretty good any other time.,1
My husky had this destroyed in about 30 minutes.,0
"This is a matter of dosage. The garlic found in dog treats, dog food, and garlic tablets designed for dogs is not likely to cause this toxic reaction. They would have to eat something like 50 cloves (not bulbs, cloves) for a medium sized dog to get enough to cause a toxic reaction. A clove is one of the little sections. You would know it if your dog ate enough to cause a toxic reaction, you would be missing a lot of garlic! That would equally approximately 10-20 bulbs, depending on the variety.",1
I liked this so much I had to buy another for our lake house.,1
"The picture that is on Amazon today shows two blue scoops, one red scoop and one black scoop. The title says that you will receive 12 assorted scoops. What I got was one green scoop.",0
I didn't realize when I ordered that this product was coming directly from China.  It took a long time to get to me.  It's a very cute product and I wanted to like it but the fabric wasn't stretchy enough to be able to get it on my dog.  I gave it away because it was too much of an ordeal to return it.,0
Product came on time... my puppy smells so good after her bath,1
My two Golden Retrievers (age 12 and 4) love it!,1
PLEASE DO NOT BUY! this toy is not made well at all. It collapsed while my bird was playing with it. Thankfully my bird was not hurt. it was a complete waste of money. but more importantly it is DANGEROUS. Drs Fosters & Smith sell these for a lot less and they are made so much better.,0
I hate that I cannot seem to discontinue the auto ship program.  I have tried 3 times unsuccessfully to stop shipment.  So frustrated with this program and process!,0
The sturdiness of the zipper was a huge disappointment. My 13lb dog managed to get the zipper off the track and now it is useless.,0
"Ordered previously without issue. Received 2 large bags 1/22/16 and both expire 3/16... this is pretty disappointing,",0
"One of the best prices I have found, and it is nice to be able to order in quantity. As well, these fit in two different types of dispensers we use. Two drawbacks - (1)it is hard to see where to tear the bags and have found that if I am not careful in the tearing, the bags can shred (two different occasions), and (2) I have experienced leakage from the bags three times (as gross as it sounds) when the bags were not immediately discarded after pickup (ie when I had to carry them on the dogwalk for more than a block to the nearest dumpster). If it had just happened once, I would have called it a fluke, but I now carry them held out away from me and the dogs. These are useful for just yard pick-ups, but I will not order them again for our city walking.",0
This is a quiet unit that does a good job keeping the protein at a minimum.  Easy and simple to install.,1
"This bowl is pretty solid and seems durable, but the company decided to label each unit with a massive sticker that is difficult to remove and leaves a tough residue. After 30 minutes of scrubbing with every cleaning product at my disposal, I still have traces of adhesive all over the sides. It's unsightly, but I've given up.

Not recommended. It's worth spending a few extra dollars on a bowl that is labeled with the consumer in mind.",0
Was delivered broken.........with bits of the plastic corners chipped off.  They need to solve this problem because as it is I 'd have to say it's very cheaply made.  We threw it away immediately.,0
Didn't work,0
The quality was amazing for the price! And it fit my horse perfectly. Received the product promptly and in great condition.,1
My cat adores these treats!,1
We couldn't assemble it and thus use it because nobody in the family was able to unscrew the screw with any of our tools to attach the base. Sent it back. How can someone design such a thing and sell it for money? And why didn't I read the reviews before purchase...,0
"Glad I was home when the mail ran. This box is not marked live or anything. (Otherwise I'm sure my postman would of brought it to the door) Postman left it in my mailbox (have an extra large mailbox) and it 19degrees outside. So I had a few that were stunned almost froze. These came in a box layered with egg crate, easy to get out. I used a blow dryer to warm them up and they came to life lol!  Will definitely be buying again.",1
Did not fit the Neater Feeder that I had.,0
love this food for our cats - we have been getting this kind for a long time - between amazon and wag.com we get pretty much the same price at the pet store but with free shipping we always have some on hand and then don't have to run out,1
Horrible product!! Dog chewed it easily and she pooped out the pieces. Not made with quality parts. Do not buy!,0
"When my Shih tzu ""SASHA""got sick and would not eat this was a great help keeping her energy level up.. She would not eat but would still lick this from my finger..I keep this on hand ALWAYS now. This was alot better price per tube than at local stores. Thanx again Amazon!",1
"I used the product as a cover for my drivers seat. Replaced after about 2 weeks, due to cover sliding off the seat. The constant adjustment just to sit down was a deal breaker. As a side, it did not even closely, match my cars interior. Would not recommend.",0
"This was a disappointment.  Although it fit my dog well, the black ending around the harness has completely come apart after just a few weeks of wear.  It happened just after my window to return the product:(",0
Great Product,1
"Good product in general.  My cats love it.  My diabetic cat requires wet food, and this food is low in carbs and high in protein.  Gave it a 1 star because the price on amazon is about half off my local pet store price, but every time I order it's a crap shoot.  This last time, I threw away about half the cans because they were severely dented and I worried about the safety.  Shipping boxes on all the orders were in excellent condition, so I believe this happened in the warehouse.  I didn't return because a lot of times I don't use the food right away as I finish older food first before opening the new case and by then the return window is closed.",0
My cat hates it.  It is perfect!,1
"There is no belt with this treat bag. There is a clip which can clip on to a belt or top of pants. When you take your hand of the bag with the treat in it the bag detaches from what it is hooked on and falls to the floor. The dog loves it but it is not the reason I bought a treat bag.

This is not a treat bag which works the way a treat bag should, if you want to hang treats off your waist it is ok. For quick grabs as in clicker training it will not work. The drawstring and extra fabric are also in the way if you want a quick grab treat.  A waste of money because a plastic sandwich bag in my pocket works just as well.",0
"The best addition to my tanks! I ordered 10 but received 12. The smallest 2 are 1 inch. The rest were bigger. They all arrived live packed great with easy to follow instructions. My axolotls ""play"" with them. Pushing them around and sitting on them.",1
"I was surprised how nice this collar and leash are made and very pretty fabric that is nice and strong. I am fostering a female
Shar pei and wanted to get her a nice  matching collar and leash , so many are made cheap now days with plastic on the collars and harness , no plastic on this matching set . and I like that it's much safer for the dog . I would recommend this set for a female dog",1
These are the perfect small size for training with a large size breed. They are moist and delicious and the dog loves them. We've ordered two bags now.,1
"Tagg used to be a pretty good product. They've since been bought by Whistle, who released an app and service update that removed email alerts for when your pet leaves the area, limited the number of phone numbers that can receive SMS alerts to one number, and updated their app to focus on activity tracking and social features first, and giving you peace of mind about knowing if your pet gets loose as an afterthought. The new Tagg trackers are also overdue for a promised feature for overheating alerts, which was a big reason for upgrading to the new device.",0
"Pros: Cuts down on smell and clumps well
Cons: Extremely messy. Bag is too heavy for me to use, it spills horribly every time, and my cats love to kick this litter out of the box which they have never done before",0
the thermostat broke after 2 days and this is pure crap,0
Worst product i ever bought!!!! it doesn't suck up old food or even move water through it!!,0
My dogs reallyyyy love this! I bought all three sizes for my 3 dogs and they play with them all the time! These are extremely high quality and last forever but my big dog kills the squeakers on all of them in the first few hours. No biggie tho...,1
"I wish it has descriptions for the physical sizes. I bought it for my pond, but found out it is too, too, too small.",0
You definitely get what you pay for.. This does not block out smell at all.. I change my kitty litter box every single night and the stuff I had before blocked out any smell there was whereas this stuff lets the smell escape and then you end up with a super stinky house.. Never again..,0
"Despite the other bad review I decided to try this product thinking the other user was probably an exception. I was wrong. The collar started issuing corrections to my dog while he was not making any noise at all, he was just standing still. This collar was worse than useless.",0
"I use this for my Shepherd/Husky mix, he's about 9 months old now and pretty big. He still has plenty of space to grow. The crate is sturdy and a great buy for the price. I would recommend this crate.",1
"We bought this brand as it came highly recommended from many friends as a grain free food.  However shortly after a full ""transition"" both of our puppies started having terrible diarrhea.  Finally the cause of their discomfort was attributed to the food.  We since have transitioned back to Hills Science Diet Puppy without any further issues.  Not sure if Amazon will give us credit or a return on this either...",0
"My two cats love this drinking fountain, they seem to drink more water from this, it is like coming fresh from the faucet...
Thank You",1
Not really what I was expecting.  Doesn't work as expected. Binds up and I have to manually release it. It is on my k9 correctly per the instructions.,0
Very cute but squeaker doesn't work at all,0
"Junk.  I bought two of these and one of them cycled on/off, on/off and never heated the water.  The other one I turned all the way up and it wouldn't heat past 70 degrees after 24 hours.  I bought two 50 watt models for two 5 gallon tanks.  My room temp is 68 degrees constantly.  I don't want to bash this company too hard because Amazon shipped these to me in padded envelopes (Their new cost saving method) and these aren't meant to be thrown on the ground and kicked around by careless mail carriers.  I guess you get what you pay for though.  I went with this model instead of Eheim because of it's size for my nano tanks.  I am now going to purchase Eheim...just not through Amazon...",0
"My Yorkie turns his nose up at these. At first, he ate them. I was pleased. This lasted only 5 days. Now, he sniffs if and turns his head away.",0
High quality and very strong,1
My dogs love the variety in these 24 Cesar Home Delights. Always quick delivery.,1
Bags are excellent to carry in your pockets anywhere (empty). Fast shipping from seller. Will buy again.,1
This is not working.. All the other times I have not had a problem with it but this time the cats still have a flea problem.. what is wrong?I won't buy from you anymore.,0
"Purchased this as a crate bed for my older dog based on the predominantly positive Amazon reviews, size fitting my crate and the price.  Delivery was prompt, but once unpacked and used, the product is very disappointing.  The only substantive padding on this thing is on the borders; the body of the bedding (where the animal mainly lays on) has almost no padding to speak of!  I should have heeded the warnings from some other reviewers.  Also, the material of the bed sheds very easily, creating a potential of the animal ingesting the small furballs and the negatives that come with that.  The only positive about this item is its flexibility, folding easily to fit in the washer/dryer.  My dog did not like it one bit, just kept pawing at it.  Not worth the money I paid!",0
Does not work good!!!!!,0
Good quality.,1
Inhabited immediately.  Works great!,1
Plastic was damaged,0
"I got this skimmer as a gift and this skimmer only worked for 3 months. It makes very loud noise from the impeller. I email Eshopps and no answer. I called the tech support and she wants to charge me $59.95 for the impeller. I told her, I rather purchase a different brand. No way that I will pay the $59.95 for the impeller because of the design issue. I recommend not to get this skimmer. Do not waste your money. I wish, I can give no star at all for this piece of junk",0
"Dimtri (my cat) comes out clean, soft and not overly perfumed; just a hint of cherry.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were made with Organic ingredients.",1
More BLUE than purple.  Listed as a purple plant.  It is a blue plant with just a bit of purple.  Very nice if I wanted a blue plant.,0
Super cute!,1
"Played fetch with Pit Bull, did not allow him to chew aggressively and these balls were destroyed in 2-3 days each. Oh well, they were cheap.",0
its smell good and good sizes as wipes! I highly recommended this item for pets and a great add ons and its cheaper.  Great products!,1
"This was cute but the product came off my cat after the first day and I was unable to find it. The material was also not the best quality, and certainly didn't look like it needed to be used on a cat with claws. Money down the drain.",0
My dog love this,1
Tiny sized,0
"This rock is very poor quality artificial rock. It is a cement based product and was not cured well. I put it in a curing tank to test it before putting it in my reef tank and an hour after putting it in there was a very visible amount of film on top of the water. The ph. rose to 13 in the water. After 3 water changes and 5 hours of soaking it is still rising to a PH of 10 with every water change. It's also depleting Alkalinity in of the water indicting that it is not a cured product. It looks nothing like the picture it looks more like a big chunk of cement with some shells mixed in.
I have some sort of Oil slick oozing out of the rock now as well smalls like diesel oil. This crap is not usable at all.",0
Well my dogs do!,1
Cat figured out a way around it.  Eats up batteries.  Charger did not work effectively.  May be OK for a dog.,0
These are my dogs favorite.  Great deal on Amazon.,1
This dog life jacket fits exactly as it says! Does the job nicely and looks great too. My dog seems to like it too,1
"Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy didn't really enjoy it or chew on it, and instead went for other shaped toys. When he did finally decide to chew it, he was around 8 months old, and he tore this thing apart in about 10 minutes.",0
My baby loves this! Small kibble size perfect for toy poodle,1
"Used it twice so far; I've had it maybe three weeks. One of the metal prongs has already fallen off, looks like the weld was rusted.(After the first use...) I've kept it indoors, so its poorly put together. All the prongs bend incredibly easy; just about every other time you pick up anything they bend. Its a constant hassle to keep bending them back; they don't bend back evenly. I'm 5'8"" and I constantly have to bend; I read a review about a gentleman that was over 6' having the same problem, I didn't think I would have the same issue due to being shorter.",0
Adorable. Fit my pup perfectly and made him look like Santa's cutest little helper. Didn't irritate him at all. I just wish there had been a hole for a leash to connect to a harness or collar. Made it difficult to take him anywhere in his sweater.,1
My dog loves her food and I feel good providing her a healthy meal every day!!,1
I like everything about it but when it said silent wheel i thought it was but it squeeks so loud that i couldn't sleep at night. But other than that ut was fine,1
the solar works just a couple days .,0
"I had high hopes for this collar.....but unfortunately it does not have any calming effects on one of my cats.
It smells like lavender......maybe my cat doesn't know that lavender is suppose to calm her down!",0
"My dog. Skippy. loves these biscuits. And he,s a finicky eater. Hope they're good for him!",0
My cat has always had problems with hairballs because she is so furry. She was always vomiting. Since I found this product she rarely vomits. I mix a little in with her wet food in the morning and she loves it! Thank you.,1
"I was very excited about this toy when I first received it. It was bigger than I expected but the quality was not very good or durable. I understand it is a plush toy but my bordercollie likes to hold toys in his mouth (its a weird comfort thing) and after a few hours of him drooling all over it the fins started coming off at the seams. Also, the squeaker did not actually squeak when I first got it (since he isn't really into squaker toys I didn't think it was the end of the world - but for other users keep this in mind)! Definitely will not be buying this toy again.",0
Excellent product.,1
"don't know why, but my lovebird seems to prefer anything over this product.",0
"This is great! It's tall,  very colorful and fun to watch. Downside is the noise.",1
After 4 month light doesnt work any more I guess u get what u pay,0
With the Kong name I thought it would be more durable but didn't last as long as a normal tennis ball would. My dog had it stripped in less than ten minutes. A regular tennis ball lasts him for weeks.,0
My dogs love this stuff.  My main complaint is that Amazon can't seem to keep it stocked in 15 pound size and that makes it a pain for Subscribe.  A couple times my dogs ran out.,1
I can get more quality for bigger packages so I won't have to worry about getting it everytime I turn around.,1
"I buy this stuff in bulk. I have an Old English Sheepdog- who has an extremely long and course coat. She is such a hard dog to bathe because she takes forever to wash and dry. So I only give her a full bath every 3-4 months. In the meantime I use this stuff to clean her up after meals or when she has an upset stomach. It is such a life saver! I've spent a fortune on other water-less cleansing products and nothing works as well as this stuff. I am very sensitive to the over-perfumed sprays on the market and I worry that they can't really be too healthy for my dog, heck- I can't stand being in a room with an over-scented dog, I could never imagine walking around with that artificial perfume stuff on me, especially with such a sensitive sense of smell. I would highly recommend this product- it is a great to use this to keep the coat clean in between full body water baths. In fact, I am planning to buy another 5 bottles now.",1
"Was really impressed at the wattage for the price. However, within a day of putting this in the tank, it leaked water. Worst of all, when i reached in the tank to check the temp, there was voltage going through the water. Luckily, no animals were injured. But definetly NOT worth it.",0
"At first, my cat liked this product, but then turned against it completely.  I tried the tuna but it was awful looking with really large dark chunks of fish.  Never bought it again.",0
works great,1
Love it!  Even my 7 yr old granddaughter can make them!,1
"Hard to believe someone would put their name on an item and market it as a training tool when the quality is as much as a $.25 child's toy. I can not imagine this whistle being good for any purpose, let alone training a dog. Besides the fact that it gives almost no fluctuation (to adjust volume for  varying distance), I should be able to focus on the dog not trying to get the whistle to work. Pure junk. Made in China...",0
I honestly don't know what it is about this toy but my dog loves it. I think its the size. This is the only toy my dog makes squeak. Shes never destroyed a toy and this one is no different but it seems well made.,1
"I really do like the soft claws.  It works good.  My only problem is that I run out of the glue applicator tips way too soon.  My cat (Sir Charleston) is very active & he loses one or two of the soft claws a week so I have to put him some new ones on nearly every week--just to replace the ones that fall off.  Well I have to use a new glue applicator every time cause as I use them I throw them away cause I cannot figure out how to clean them to be able to use them again.  I've tried soaking them in rubbing alcohol & finger nail polish remover.  Nothing unclogs the glue in it for me.  So if anyone has any suggestions on this or where I could order some applicator tips, I would really appreciate it.  Other than that, I love the product.  Charleston couldn't be declawed & I really wanted him in the house so I gave this a try.  I'm very pleased with it other than the problem with the applicator tips.  And Charleston doesn't seem to be bothered with them at all.",1
My dog gave it to paws up,1
A hands down favorite of my dogs. Glucosamine & Chrondrotin is a favorite recommendation from my vets. No better way to get it than in a tasty chewy (not hard) treat.,1
Product broken after 2 month of use.....,0
"I bought this product based on the fact that the first ingredients were fish related, as in menhaden fish meal and salmon meal. Instead, the first two ingredients on the package I received are chicken meal and turkey meal. Not what I expected. I am not sure that I will even feed this to the dog I bought it for, as I was looking for a grain-free product in which the primary ingredient was fish related, not chicken and turkey. I don't know who is to blame here, whether it is amazon which printed the wrong label, or Dogfordog, for changing the product without notifying amazon.",0
"OMG!  I have bought these in the past, but the new remote has horrible labeling with numbers instead of letters.  In addition, the vibrate option for each collar is actually shocking my dogs!  This was a horrible thing to discover!",0
Does not fit 40 gallon breeder tanks as advertised,0
"Works well, good price, fast delivery",1
"This is not doing anything to deter my cats anymore.  It worked for the first few days, but now they pretty much just look at it.",0
"This supplement eases stomach upset in all my kitties.  I've used it for years now, and it's helped even when I've had a kitty on medication that had nausea as a side effect.",1
"Folks. For the reviews here that have stated ""well my hard-chewing dog had this torn apart in an hour"", etc... This is an interactive TUG toy. This is not meant / designed to be an unattended chew toy. It is not a Nylabone, or Kong toy. Chewing / tugging - entirely different.

I had one Katie's Bumpers tug for my large Shepherd, who loves to bite / tug hard - still have it after 4 years of use in our training.",1
Great masks. Only thing i would change is how the mask stays on. The top should be more secure but it works and horses have no flies.,1
"I bought this for my Chihuahua.  She doesn't have an undercoat so she gets cold easily.  I have blankets all over the house for her, but sometimes she likes to cuddle and this is great when I need to move and do things around the house.  She gets really comfortable in there.  It's also comfortable for me.  Highly recommended if you have a small cuddlebug.",1
plenty of adjustable lengths with the rings,1
Nice quality. Quick shipping.,1
this did not work at all.  had to send it back and get a refund since it did not work,0
Nice,1
Not very bright,0
"these are awesome!
bought one and a self-heating insert for each dog to be used on the porch when they want to be out in cold weather.",1
"Great food, great ingredients. My lab puppy loves it and scarfs it down, but I think he would eat anything that wasn't nailed down! We are currently feeding him 1 cup less than the 4 cups recommended on the bag. Make sure you aren't over feeding your pup. After all, dog food companies are in the business of selling dog food!! The only negative we have had is some gas (not terrible) and fishy breath after eating. But that coat is shiny and he has lots of energy.

We have been feeding this food from day one. The day we brought him home they had run out of the Life's Abundance they were feeding him (that could only be bought online!), so we switched cold turkey (not recommended). The day we brought him home at 8 weeks he had orange-ish loose stool. After a day on the Wellness he had healthy-colored, solid stool!",1
"I like this bench cover quite a lot.  The fabric is thick, waterproof and seems tough.  The straps appear to be sturdy and high quality.  There are little pockets around it for whatever reason, and holes for the seat belts to come through if you want.  The cover is meant to attach to head rests on the seat with straps, and then another strap goes around the back of the seat to hold the middle tight, and there is a bungee cord thing to go under the bottom seat.  I don't have head rests in the back seat of my car, so I'm improvising, but I appreciate the strap around the back of the seats.  The bungee cord on the bottom does me no good at all, but perhaps it will work for you.  At any rate the product is well made and works perfectly.",1
Have used this product for over 2 years.  We have a Yorkie and she does well with this as it is tearless.  A gallon lasts us about a year with weekly bathing.,1
It did not work. My dog was still very nervous .,0
Just as pictured. Great price from retail.,1
"Nice try, but huge fail IMO.  Leashes are for control, which this coupler gives very little of.  It's like bungee cords for dogs.  It give the dogs a lot of room to move and if either one decides to stop to smell the ground while the other one is still walking, well one of them is going flying... which happened all the time.  If you want a good laugh, buy it.",0
"I had high hopes for this pet bed. But five minutes after I gave it to the dog, she already had a hole in the outer layer. The search continues for A chew proof pet bed.",0
Too narrow for dogs necks. The narrower the collar the more apt to choke the dog. There should be a width selection available. Other than my width comment this is almost perfect collar.,0
"Useless. Range is 15ft if that, says 50' on the package.",0
I love it,1
Pain to use.,0
"I got the medium for my 14lb frenchie at the time. He's now gaining weight and is about 17lbs. I noticed the neck is starting to fit a bit fitted, and it's harder to get off the head. I know his head and neck will get bigger, so if you buy for a Frenchie or bulldog, get a bigger size. Other than that it's perfect! The chest is adjustable so thats not a problem",1
This product was just what i was looking for. I have a 45 lb Pit bull puppy and a very large open back yard with no fence. I use this product to play with her outside. It gives her plenty of room to run and play with her tennis balls and gives me the piece of mind of not worrying about her taking off for a squirrel or even another dog.,1
Color is nothing like picture material is not silicone it's plastic . I'm returning it it's terrible,0
"I am not sure if it was our dog or the ball. German Shepherds can be skittish and ours was definitely more afraid of this ball and she found no enjoyment from it at all. We tried to initiate her to play with us, and we got nothing.
Buy a used one first and see if your dog likes it. I would have waited to find that out rather than spending my money on it.
thank you.",0
Greenies are a lifesaver-literally! My cat takes 2 very important pills a day and I don't think I could even get one into him without Greenies Pill Pockets! He now looks forward to his medicine at every dose time!,1
Replaced my lost furminator. My lab loves to be brushed with this.,1
Fits the crate great,1
"Underside was broken in slivers.

So part of the base was in tact, test of base food fell through.
Returned due to product condition,
Also, big for me I'd it's made of compressed wood whereas  not able to wash it as if it were made of plastic.",0
It's rather unfortunate that I can't return this product.  My dog simply won't eat his food with this on it.  He hates it.  I believe in probiotics & enzymes for our furry family but I can't rate how well the product works since my dog won't eat it.,0
"We have a 90 lb golden retriever/hound mix. We've tried so many different products to stop her from pulling, but none of them really work. She doesn't pull as hard, but it still doesn't correct the pulling and if she sees something she wants, she'll go for it. If your dog is on the border of size, go with the size smaller. Our dog measures for an extra large, but it slides around too much. Had we gotten a large, this could potentially work, but I'm still not sure. On to the next product.",0
My cat LOVES it. I'd buy again if it were cheap enough.,1
"I looked at these cat towers because the ones in pet smart were twice as much.  However, you get what you pay for.  This is very poorly made.  They use pressboard and paper thin carpeting and rope for the scratch poles.  My cat is only average size, but he does not really fit in the top perch or the hammock.  This may be work it for a kitten. I wouldn't buy from pawhut again.",0
"Very well made. Fit my girls well, keeps them dry, truly waterproof and very absorbant. Best buy ever and I have tried many.",1
"My dog thrives because of these, and now a LOT of my family and friends use it for their dogs, too!",1
"My Chessie has open sores on both sides of her head from this muzzle They are under the eyes, I won't be using this muzzle anymore,",0
"One of my kitties has IBS, according to my vet.  This product seems to be helping Frankie and his overactive bowel, so I will continue with it.  He eats it willingly mixed in with a little wet food.",1
"This is a great toy for small dogs. My Min. Poodle barks when I pick it up. She looks forward to playing. Came on time. Recommend amazon, it is a better price then in the stores.",1
"I have a very small dog,  she is able to get completely out of it",0
cat really loves this product,1
The dog still hates it and the sound of the velcro when you have to take it off is very disturbing for him.  I imagine it's also very loud as it's right up against their head and already loud enough for me.  Going to try the inflatable inner tube one.,0
"Easy to put together, but not that sturdy!",0
"I could not believe once I set this tree up, my cat immediately started playing and scratching on the posts.  She especially loves the top bed.  She likes to rub her face on the edges, and roll around on the platforms.  It's not tall so it really works in the family room.  It doesn't become the focal point of the room.  I am very pleased with the purchase and would completely recommend this to anyone with a cat or kitten.",1
"This is my second one, to make his area bigger. Perfect for taking with us in our fifth wheel!",1
"My dog loves these.  I think he uses them more for fun than function, but they are sturdy and well built.",1
My dumb little ham loves these things! Rubbing them in catnip then bouncing them across the room makes them one of her favorite things to play with,1
This didn't challenge or slow down any of my cats AT ALL. Total waste of money!,0
Very nice pet rear car seat cover for the money. Fit my Dodge Dakota perfectly. I would recommend this cover to anyone with a pet. Great quality for a great price. Like the fact that the straps hold the cover in place. My wife bought a cover at a local pet store and this one is much nicer.,1
"I bought the cat tunnel for my rabbit, she loves it. She is in and out of it all the time when she is loose. She also loves the dangly ball hanging from it.
I would definitely buy it again if I had to.",1
"I love this product. I began getting my dog accustomed to the leash as directed to do in videos I watched. Despite wanting to immediately take my dog out on a walk, I patiently played with her and gave her treats. I finally tested the product out during a one mile walk...it was the most relaxing walk with my dog. I will begin to use this leash on all my other dogs and future dogs.",1
Pictures of product. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.,1
may help in long run,1
Dogs like these.,1
After a time in tank this piece became brittle and was crushing any time i tuched it to clean leaving sharp edges,0
"I bought this food as a donation to a local animal shelter. This is the brand and type they indicated they needed the most. I'm told it is cost effective and better than other low priced types. So for the shelter, it was exactly what they wanted.",1
The filter has never flowed properly. The water just pours out the front of the filter very loud! Think twice before buying!,0
Did not work.  PERIOD.,0
"Quality poor - previous items were fine- these were dried out and impossible to form around a capsule...noticeable difference in this order - have made do with them,used 4 pkgs so far all poor..",0
No issues here,1
"This crate does what it's suppose too! I got the 42-inch for my German Shepard Mix and it's a perfect size for her. She can stand up and lay down comfortably and even has a little extra room, I even attached a picture of her and my brother who is 6 foot!",1
These doggy diapers are Great quality  and stay on well too! There also easy to wash which is super convenient.  Iv even ordered another 3 pack !,1
To high  price,0
A favorite!,1
My cat loves it!,1
"My 14 week old lab puppy devoured one of these rings in less than 15 minutes. He is in full teething mode, but can't make a mark on a nylabone yet - and based on other reviews I thought it would last much much longer.",0
I tried this litter to see how it would perform. It was terrible! This litter tracked so much! And scooping it out of the box was difficult. It was wet clay. Im looking for a litter that tracks very little,0
"Way too small, returned it",0
"It didn't fit snuggly and was difficult for me to adjust.  It could be I was missing something, but I went back to my dog's old harness.",0
i purchased this for any one of our dogs for christmas the years before last in 2011.  zorro loves it and has managed to dimantle it.  so my mom got him another one.  i am surprised it lasted as long as it did.  usually with our shih tzu's nothing lasts long this did.  hence why we got another one.  mine has the pink fire hydrant and loves it.  would highly recommend this for anyone.  usually our guys destroy toys within minutes. not with the zanies.  thank you,1
"It seems to do the trick. We can adjust so that it is not too tight and the size chart seems to fit 'true sizes'. I got him the navy, and it looks sharp against his rusty red long coat. He can get out of it really easily, but it is overall the best solution. Very heavy duty, washes clean quite well.

We only used it for a week and it improved his potty skills two-fold. Though remember, this is not a permanent fix and there are so many more things that go into potty training. This woks best for incontinence, definitely. I wash/sterilize and use it on my special needs dog clients - they love them.",1
"Awesome!  Keeps the crafty cattle dog from licking things he shouldn't x9 months, and saves my furniture from being bashed by the plastic cone.",1
"This is a great product. I recieved it on time and easy to use. I have had it a little over a month with no problems and so far only charged it once when I got it. I had some concerns after reading some of the reviews,but no problems",1
This product didn't work for us. Seems like the pump part to it was broken.,0
works pretty darn good,1
The pink was not as pictured it was a bright hot pink. We ordered a medium case but it came as small. we got lots of use out of the leash it is great. But we only got one use of the harness as our dog grew out of it.,0
"Really wish the guidelines for Kong were posted here, just like the package insert. Would've been nice to know that my Great Dane puppy at 8 weeks old is way tooo big got a medium. Sizing insert says he needs an XL.",0
"When we attempted to enlarge the harness to fit our Doug's torso, it completely fell apart.  If the strength of a hand could cause this to happen, can you imagine what a car accident would do?  I sent it right back and will pursue a better quality item.",0
"I was hoping this was the answer to my pits pulling problem. Boy, was I wrong. Not only did it not work it left her with raw and tender areas under her front legs that took a week to heal! I also purchased two of these for my smaller dogs but was so disappointed I sent them all back. They may have worked fine for the smaller dogs - I'll let someone else make that determination!",0
"I purchased this brush after having to return a similar, but less expensive version of another Slicker self-cleaning brush (a larger one), which worked very briefly before it's poor design soon caused it to fail & no longer function. This brush seems to have a much better design than the larger, less expensive version (which now appears to no longer be available) & the design flaw which caused the bristle misalignment problems on the first brush, is no longer a problem with this one. The thicker design incorporated into this one, seems to provide the necessary bristle alignment which is crutial for positive functioning. Another beneficial feature with this brush's design, is that the button doesn't need to be continually depressed while cleaning it. On this brush, the button clicks on or off, locking the bristles in one position or the other. So far, I really like using the brush. Neither of my 2 Border Collies like to be brushed, but they do seem to tolerate this type of brush, better than some others I've tried. The self-cleaning design is a wonderful time saver, & for me, the brush's biggest selling point. I do wish they made a larger version of this brush, because I think that the larger the surface area provided by the bristles, the gentler it feels to my dogs.",1
A+++,1
Way too large.,0
cat loves it.  still intact after extensive playing.  good deal,1
"I appreciate the free samples, but I won't give my dog anything that's made in China.",0
"though it's a well-made toy, my 4 cats weren't that thrilled with it. a big part of the problem seems to be the fact that the pendulum doesn't swing very freely. i loosened up the holding screws a bit & that helped but still only minimal interest from the cats  :-(",0
"Our pet rats love these tunnels. They make a great place for a rat to play, hide, or stash food. No cage is complete without one.

Depending on how much your rodents chew on the plastic, it might only last a few months. Our rats chewed the first tube we got them to pieces, but haven't been hard on the replacements.",1
"I bought these toys for my husband's puppy Chihuahua. She's teething and these balls and rope toys really help, and we get a big kick out of her running after them.",1
"Would have to sacrifice middle seat belt to use in Toyota Tundra since there is no hole for should seat belt to slip thru, seems like it wouldnt be hard to have it made for one since newer vehicles no longer are lap belt only. Great for protecting seat bad if you have people in the back.",0
"I was so excited to get this toy because it is very cute. We got the Stegosaurus version of the toy, and as soon as I opened the package my dog was just as excited as I was. Up until this point she had been barking at the UPS man who delivered it!

This toy says it is designed for active chewers up to 50lbs. My 5 year old Clumber Spaniel is a very active chewer, and weighs 50lbs - I thought it was perfect! However, within twenty minutes, she had chewed it to the point where it looked like a giant wad of used bubble gum.",0
"7 WK OLD LITTLE HAVERNESE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.  I JUST PUT A LITTLE WARM WATER TO SOFTEN IT AND,  HE LAPS IT UP.  I WILL BUY AGAIN BUT,  YOU GET SUCH A LARGE BAG;  IT WILL LAST FOREVER.",1
"Read the ingredients before you buy. I bought this without reading the ingredients, thinking it was a quality product because it's ""better than."" It's just corn flour, soy flour, wheat bran, corn oil, flavors, and colors. Grain and cheap oil. Sure, dogs love it, but it's just junk food for dogs.",0
Sizing is not correct.,0
Annoying and it broke easily. Pets has not interest in it.,0
"The description needs to change.  The first sentence needs to be THE PRICE IS FOR ONE MOUSE.

They should also update the images.  Upload pics of one mouse, not 5.",0
Our dog does not like and has to be coached to take them. He likes Pill pockets much better on most of the flavors.,0
This stuff had no effect on fleas i sprayed my dog before i sent him out and when he came in  he still had fleas on him  not doing what it claimed to do at all,0
This stuff works!!!,1
"Good idea but poor quality renders this thing useless. The clamp immediately broke.

Back it goes.",0
"My two felines love this. The one will yowl in the hallway at 3am to tell me she has 'caught' it. They did manage to pop a seam but I busted out my needle and thread and fixed it! Other than that, no further issues with the product.",1
My fur baby loves this toy she will order more,1
"My dog loves the greenies.  It helps his dental care.  I give it to him every morning and if I forget, he just waits in the kitchen for it.  This is bigger than others I have used.  He also like the size.",1
This toothbrush is horrible!!!! The bristles started falling off in my dogs mouth within one week of use!!! TERRIBLE and not safe,0
"Easy to apply inside any tank, even small ones.  My fish loves it and spends most of his day lounging around in his bed.",1
I don't ever write reviews but seeing some of the low star ratings for this made me upset. Proud owner of 3 chihuahuas and let me tell you these work THE BEST. I've tried every kind even the Petsmart ones that some other customer was raving about and this is the only product for my pups that works the best. Since I have small pups they are able to use them more than once.,1
My morkie loves these!!!,1
Makes a difference in energy levels and health of kittens that adult foods can't provide. Used these up to one year and it was still making a difference,1
"I did not purchase this through Amazon...I bought the exact stroller in HomeGoods (BTW, great deal there).  I purchased for 3 newly adopted cats.  Holds 2 of them (9 pounds and 6 pounds) comfortably, but will not accommodate the 3rd kitty (10 pounds) comfortably with them.  We've had this stroller for three months and all the cats LOVE it!!!  I left it opened in the house for them to get used to jumping in and out with their toys....then they started taking their cat naps in it.  Great for walks throughout the neighborhood or shopping center, but for parks or rougher terrain I would get something heavier duty.  They are safely zipped inside (no escape route as I have seen in some cheaper strollers) Very lightweight & folds easily to pop in the trunk.  Lots of window space for the cats to look out which they love.  Con...the zippers get stuck a lot!  I wish it had better quality zippers, wheels, and the compartment was a little bigger to fit all 3 of my girls.  I'm in the market now for an upgrade to something a little largerer and sturdier.",1
"It is a nice large ramp, but it has a crack that looks like from the manufacturing.  It doesn't go all the way through and is on the underside so I don't think it will be an issue, just an annoyance.  The main platform is also not level (maybe due to the crack) it is higher on one side and dips on the other.  My beardie who is still a juvenile cannot lay flat on top of it.",0
I have a simple question - what is the total number of pads for this order item? The image of the item shows only 4 pads.  $8.40/pad seems rather steep.,0
Great product. Size is perfect. Good service,1
Cheap. Works good. I found the Velcro closure a bit trying to get into with one hand.,1
Second time ordering from this company. The item is great. We brought a new puppy into the family and therefor needed a new tag. The first tag that we ordered from this company is still holding strong on our 3 year old Berners collar.,1
Small dog doesn't like!  He likes soft toys.,0
"Sorry to say this was quite small for my 10 # Yorkie........I ordered the medium as per previous reviews said it runs small......it is too small even at the medium.  I am giving it to a person who has a tiny teacup puppy.  But, the quality was good.",0
my dog's favorite of all treats!,1
"I loved my cat more than I love most people. I rescued her two years ago at 6 weeks old and she's been my best friend ever since. Yesterday morning I found her dead curled up on a rug under my dining room table. The day before, I used this Hartz product on her, thinking it would help her... I've never felt so guilty or depressed... Please don't make the mistake of buying this product. I can't even live with myself.... She was still a baby. R.I.P. Little Bit. I love you so much.",0
This helps keep our dogs teeth clean.  We have used this since 2010 when we found it in an Alaska Vet's office.,1
It is exactly as advertised and perfect for what I wanted. Amazon saved me the trip to town once again.,1
Our go to dry food for our dog. She loves it. Small breed size is sometimes harder to find and I don't understand why its more $$.,1
Meets my expectation.,1
They kept coming off and sticking to everything. Choked one of my puppies :(,0
"The tester did not work on day one. It would beep when the dog barked, but after a couple of weeks it stopped working.",0
I did not work with my pets.  They still mark in same area.  I so wish this did work for me!,0
Bought this for my dog who was getting the winter itch. He smells so good when I use this and he has stopped itching significantly. His fur is also very soft after using this product. I would recommend if you have an itchy pup give this a try.,1
This doesn't work at all. Plain water works better.,0
"I bought 3 of these dragons, 1 for each of my dogs. The black dragon I gave to my 8 year old bulldog that is not very hard on her toys, and within 5 min. she had found a week spot in the seam under the wings and ripped it. The periwinkle dragon was bought for my husky pup and within a day she had damaged the squeaker inside the dragon. I bought the olive green dragon for my minpin mix that destroys everything and anything that he gets, and he has had it for weeks with no damage to it at all. Witch leads me to the next issue I had. I requested the free one time replacement toy that they send if your dragon gets destroyed,  and when I received it I was very disappointed. The toy was a cheap flimsy snake toy that was full of fluff, I did not even give it to my dogs because I didn't feel like picking up fluff for the next 10 min. Even though these dragons are so cool looking, I would not recommend them for any dog, unless your ok with blowing your hard earned money on a toy that will get destroyed in a short time. I may buy a couple dragons for my daughter to put on her bed, because they are pretty good looking, just not for pets.",0
Inexpensive and good quality.,1
Love mine.  Does what it's supposed to do.,1
"Overall, hard to deal with while walking a dog, trying to tie off. Needs handles, or maybe a just made little longer to be able to tie off. Some were hard to open, also.",0
I was so excited to order this for my ferret but it was huge. There is no way she will ever fit it,0
"Purchased this Scratcher because of how stylish it looked and because it also matches our d&eacute;cor of black and white.  Having 4 kittens I wanted to train them to use the scratcher as early as possible before they decided that my furniture is their scratching post and it is a good thing that I did that.  Now that they are 13 weeks old they use all their scratch pads and posts that I purchased for them when they were 6 weeks old, thank goodness!

Having had this item for several weeks and with daily use, I will say it has held up very well. The price may be inexpensive but the product is not.  They use this scratch pad several times a day and I have 4 kittens.  If they do try to scratch the dining rooms chairs I just slide the scratch pad right next to them, place their paws on it and they scratch this instead and are off to playing.  They are not into catnip yet but they are attracted to everything so I did not need to use the catnip that came with this item.

I love how you can turn this scratch pad over if and when it wears down, this way they have more to scratch on.  The design is just lovely, it looks like a cute bed with animal stripes.  They do enjoy scratching it, playing on it and sleeping on it.  So, they do get many uses out of it!

Great item! Glad I purchased it and will be purchasing more in the future!  Great item for all cat/kitten owners for sure!",1
"Great product, I put two of these together to make the perfect cage for my two guineas.  Love it and guineas do, too.",1
Motor is not very strong. Can barely do dogs nails with this. Not very impressed,0
"Another top 10 deserted island records for me...Still sounds great, plus the vinyl is blueish! They sure make records way cooler nowadays!",1
Arrived shattered.,0
2nd time purchase.  My dog and I love to play frisbee and this is a nice durable but flexible frisbee.  Don't let you dog have it by themselves though b/c it can tear up.,1
my cat still vomits with this. not worth spending extra money on it,0
"I have been using the World's Best Cat Litter for years.  We have a new rescue cat that is having some bathroom issues.  I thought it was the litter so, based on the reviews, I purchased this.

I had previously purchased a bag of this but couldn't use it since one bag wasn't sufficient for the litter box.  Upon receipt of the second bag I placed the litter into a new box with a new scoop... and had enough for replacement.

This litter is a mess!  No matter how much litter I put in the litter box the cat's urine travels to the bottom of the box.  As you are cleaning the litter box the moisture combines with the urine and sticks to the scoop... and is not easily removed.  Additionally, the litter before use is very heavy, and it gets even heavier after the cat urinates.

As it turns out, my cat's problem is not with the World's Best Cat Litter.  There is another problem, requiring surgery... but that's another story.  Suffice it to say that I'm back with the World's Best Cat Litter  It is more expensive, but it is the best litter I have ever used.  It is light, clean, catches the urine before it hits the bottom of the box, is easily scooped ... and the scoop remains clean.

I honestly do not understand all the positive reviews of this litter.  Sorry Precious Cat ... but my kitty is using The World's Best Cat Litter!",0
The second ingredient is sugar. The ingredients are identical to human cookies. These are not a good product for pets. Be a smart consumer and read ingredients of the food you feed your family. Don't fall for marketing. If you insist on giving your dogs this garbage do yourself a favor and get the human version for less money. Its the same thing,0
"Great price for a very good product. Quick delivery, happy with transaction on Amazon.",1
"These are the perfect size for me ... two of them fit in the bathtub perfectly. I have two cats, and two medium size boxes works better than one huge one. The material is great, and the sides are the right angle for maximum scrape and scoop efficiency.",1
"This seat cover is great!  extremely nice fit, looks good and has convenient pockets for misc dog items or whatever.  The straps secure it nicely and it feels high quality.  Highly recommended - I have a 07 4runner and the back seat is now dog proof while still looking good!",1
Perfect fit! Works just like my old one. It took 5 min to install. Just a few screws but you'll need help to make the installation faster. There is a bar on the other side of the door that needs to be held together while you are screwing it into the door bracket.,1
"Worked very well on our long haired cat. He had lots of matting but we took our time with this tool and got a lot if them out. He didn't like it, but didn't hate it either.",1

"constantly need to re-tighten
wobbles if not against other items
litter gets caught in cracks
overall this item is overpriced for the fact it seems to need constant maintenance
does look nice, but urine and other smells trapped easily
no where to put scooper",0
Maybe good for some cats but not mine - she wanted nothing to do with it and has never used it. She scratches her cat pole and that it. Would nit buy again - waste f money for me.,0
Dog loves it and I don't have to worry so much about pieces breaking off since it's a flexible material.,1
This xl is supposed to be 60 inches wide to fit full size truck it is only 56 inches wide,0
and I don't mean with the dog!  The collar itself started leaking the citronella spray constantly which in turn wore down the battery.  That of course also confused my dog.  My dog was miserable until I figured out that it was silently leaking spray all the time.  He was depressed and cowering because he didn't know what he had done to cause the spray to spray.  I have no idea if it would have worked on him or not.  I will be returning the product.,0
Very cute and just as advertised.  Nice length and good quality materials. Paw prints were really nicely spaced and aligned along the length of the leash.,1
Or I just didn't pay attention - but this company's sizing chart is INSANE - it's HUGE - I ordered a small and x-small and both are way too big for my dogs - won't be ordering these again.,0
Didnt like it even though its a chicken,0
"Awful, leaks right through",0
My cats smell it and then walk away!,0
This really does work!,1
Too large not medium as described,0
My mat ripped within a month of buying it. I do not recommend buying it!,0
The ball is so big that it kind of fails to attract the attention of my cats. Not sure if that is a problem of the product itself so much as just a design flaw. Maybe they could have added some feathers or something to it.,0
"My miniature schnauzer likes it. However, she picks around every piece of the freeze-dried fruits and vegetables. I don't mind because it seems gimmicky anyways, so I wish there was a version with just the kibble. I just wanted a nutritious grain-free dog food, and this seems to fit the bill. Her poops are smaller than when I had her on a slightly ""better"" dry food (Merrick Grain Free Beef & Sweet Potato), which I take to mean less waste.",1
dog not interested in it,0
waste of money when a flea jumps on the wipe will never buy again. they are not very wet either,0
I have a min pin who gets nervous and upset my vet recommended it. It has helped a lot doesn't take care of all her behaviors but does help..,1
"This product does pull off a little bit of hair but using a regular comb does much better. I really tried to give this a chance and have tried it on all my dogs, a german shepherd, husky, and a dachshund.",0
Wouldn't recommend,0
Purchased because they said heavy duty but they are thin and weak.  Buy another brand...,0
Had two litters of kittens being nursed by both moms and needed room for them all.  Worked great and the two doors were very much needed.  Tray slides easily out for cleaning.  Spaces between holes in crate sides did let the smallest kittens crawl out but I was able to deal with that.  Puppies wouldn't be able to get out because their heads are too big.  Will work to separate momma cats when they are neutered in a few weeks.  Comes with a rack to separate into two smaller crates with side opening door.,1
My dog loves these! I place a little bit on top of her kibble and she eats it all up.,1
Took my dog less than an hour to turn this into a pile of blue rubber pieces.,0
Worst quality. Stop working in 3 months.,0
Exceptional items from this seller! Everything is top quality and my fish love them!!!,1
I HATE DOING THIS SURVEY AND RESENT IT BEING SENT. iF I WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THEM i WOULD HAVE LET YOU KNOW.,1
"My vet turned me on to this as a good quality food without the exorbitant price tag.  My puppy loves it!  This will be her last ""puppy"" bag since she will be a year old soon.  I plan to use the adult formula.",1
"it did not work at all.  No spots were reduced or eliminated in any way!
I even bought a second bottle just to give it an extra chance and give it some more time.",0
"Great deal for the price compared to picking up the ""assembled"" ones from the store. I have a turtle and go through filters pretty quickly, so price point is important.",1
"Gave this to my crew who was cleaning carpet at a hotel.  Worked great to find protein and urine stains.  According to crew, it was a little scary how many places these spots showed up.  Better not to know maybe......",1
"Up front, my only complaint: This filter is a bit noisy. It may be the material it is made from, as it is hard plastic, or, it may be the impeller. It isn't to the level of annoyance, but you can hear it.

There is plenty of good. The UV sterilizer is a very nice design. This is the one design I have found where the bulb is not submerged. Therefore, there should never be water in the bulb chamber. This is big as my last UV filter was supposedly ""submersible"". Not! In the beginning, only light moisture made it's way in, but after replacing several bulbs the O-Ring would not seal properly and the bulb and electrics were submerged. I don't see how this could happen here.

It provides decent water movement, a typical filter pad, and allows you to tune the water flow. I like it and now have 3 of them.

12/04/2013 Update:

I still like the filter. I would still give it an overall 4, but I would deduct a star for filter design while adding a star for UV bulb design. First, the filter portion has a siphon tube with a back-flow valve. I don't think it necessary as it is very difficult to keep from plugging. Not impossible, just a pain. Secondly, the siphon tube is a square unit with the valve molded in. Why not a bent, round tube like all the others have that work great?

Also, the angle the filter housing sits cants a bit too far back. The water level comes precariously close to the rear lip of the housing. If the filter media were to plug I could see plenty of water heading for your floor. It is easily fixed, however. A 1/4 inch thick spacer between the filter reservoir and aquarium tilts it forward enough so that it will never be an issue. The should change this!

The UV sterilizer is great! There is no way the bulb is going to get wet. This is the only design I have seen like this. You access the bulb from outside. I also like the fact that the bulb and pump motor have separate power supplies. That way you can run the filter 24/7 while setting the UV bulb on a timer. Very well thought out!

Update 2-04-2014

I'm now dropping the rating to 2 stars. Twice now, the filter has backed up and poured water out all over my counters and wherever else the water managed to go. The only way to safely stop this is to simply use it as a UV sterilizer with no filter media. As I mentioned before, the UV filter design is great (the bulb is not submerged). Unfortunately, the filtering system and tank are not so well designed.",0
"The pan I ordered was supposed to be orange and I recieved a blue one instead. The lid comes off every time you try to lift the box, so there's no point in having a handle.",0
item arrived on time but the size was way off and did not fit on my dogs feet. Bought another pair the next size up and they were tight but did not hold in place and the rubber bottom kept sliding to the side making the socks useless.,0
The stuff sack was broken when I got it and broke further when I pulled the sleeping back out of the sack. The bag itself is bulky - too big to bring backpacking.,0
"STRONG, VERY GOOD AND MY DOG LOVE THE FREEDON...I USE THIS PRODUCT FROM MANY YEARS...THE BEST. IF YOU  NEED A LEASH, BUY IT",1

Exactly as described. They are my little dog's favorite toy.,1
"We got our turtle topper in excellent condition and it fit perfectly atop our 55 gallon tank. Within an hour or two our turtles were happily using it sprawling out under the heat lamp. When not under the lamp, the turtles next favorite spot is the resting platform suspended from the bottom of the turtle topper.

A definite enhancement to our pets habitat and a product we would definitely buy again if the need arises.",1

This is awful! I have a miniature poodle and the item is stiff and as he walked it came off his back end. There is a stupid velcro strap that I cut off..really do I need to bend down to walk the dog..if I don't have enough back problems this would really do it for me..This is horrible and very stiff product..would not advise getting this..,0

"Love love love!! It fits well and feel great to wear. The strap is soft and stretchy but thick and stable so it doesn't bounce around. I have a larger phone (Galaxy S5 Active) which is even larger with a case on it and it fit inside the pouch with room to spare. It also has a couple little pockets for keys or headphones on either side of the big pouch. Not super big and not too small. It's just right.

Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted/free price in exchange for my open and honest review.",1
"The tooltip for 2-star is ""I don't like it.""  To be clear, that's my hamsters' opinion, not mine.  My dwarf hamster finds it uninteresting, and rarely interacts with it.  My Teddy Bear hamster finds it too small, and rarely interacts with it.  They normally view it as an obstacle.  Only occasionally, they use it as a stepping tool to reach up.  Rarely do they nibble on it - which is supposed to be one of main functions.  So if you want one more obstacle in your hamster's environment, this works fine.  But why pay for an obstacle?  I have put (cut) Cheerio boxes in their cages.  They would actually nibble on it, sleep in it and, of course, it is still an obstacle.",0
"unfortunately I bought 2 and neither worked.  One would never go off, the other would randomly shock the dog.  They are super cheap.  I am sending them back",0
I received a smaller size. I am returning it. Very nice item though!,0

"I have been using Puppia Soft Harness's for years. They are well made, rarely fail, and I think they are kind to the dogs anatomy.  Only problem I have had, is when the dog eats the clasp which is plastic.  Not a fault of the harness.  They are great.",1
"Complete junk. 1st one lasted a week, 2nd one two weeks. Cheap plastic clasp broke on both. Don't waste your money.",0
I haven't installed it yet but it looks pretty premium. It was a little bent from shipping but hopefully it won't be an issue. I believe this company has been manufacturing aluminum doors for a long time and they just recently decided to bring their expertise to pet doors. I will update this review after the installation.,1
The description is very misleading. It says it's 60 L but the bag is 25.7. This is false advertising.,0
These fit the breeze system well but do nothing as far as odor control. I never smelled urine with the tidy cats brand pads and with these it's horrible.,0
LEAKS all over -  not sure what we are doing wrong. We have it attached correctly but the area of cage under bottle is always soaked. You can see it dripping.  HELP!!  5 Stars to Amazon for responding so promptly to my concern!!,0
Love the light show when the ball is touched into motion.,1
"decent, worked well.",1
heard that they are on the recall list,0
For 60$ this case is to amazing to pass up! The  cages at the store such as Petco are 2's as small and triple the cost! This one is very big roomy for my baby's and is very nice the roof can come of or be on half the cage or half of! I love this cage and my guines do to!!!,1
"Great water bowl for 2 cats and 2 dogs who are always thirsty.  The only thing is it gets heavy with all the water in it, just something to consider.",1
Love the format. Makes me shake my head that I get emails from At A Glance for 'bargain' delivery fee of $3---get it on Amazon with a qualifying order and delivery is free...,1
"Used twice and the plastic ring broke off of the purple bowl. Would have been great if assembled better, but since it fell apart so quickly I would not recommend this product or buy it again.",0
"1 of the 2 came apart the first hour of use, the metal clip came out and the rabies tag fell off at least we found it in the house.  The other one seems to be working fine, but no returns so I guess I'm out half my purchase.",0
No durable. Our dog tore this to shreds in about two seconds.,0
"TRULY, use with caution, and mine was dull as a hoe.  If your animal is a wriggler, don't buy stuff like this.  Just keep her/him combed as regularly as possible.",0
I didn't have a problem with the smell or the edges of these treats. I had a problem with the size. I thought they were entirely too big to be considered training treats. You need to have a big dog to use these treats for training. I have a maltipoo and peekapoo and these treats take them at least a minute to eat. By the time they finish the treat they've forgotten what they were praised for.,0
"We had been using the Pro Plan in the blue bag, and just bought a large bag of this flavor.
Unfortunately this formula gave our two 10 month old dogs terrible loose stools and we are in day 3 of cleaning up messes in the house everyday and them not eating.
Makes me wonder if it was a bad batch or something.",0
"This is exactly what I needed!  I have an 8.5-9 pound Toy Fox Terrier mix who squeezes out between the rod iron fence posts.  Her neck is exactly 10 inches, so we bought the 10-13"" size bumper.  She doesn't mind wearing it at all! It keeps her on the right side of the fence and allows her to run free!",1
2 days and still good,1
our cats love these treats - I can now herd them wherever I want them to be if they think I have these treats,1
"My young dog loves this toy. Toy is almost as big as her, but she drags it around. Been several months and parts have been chewed but still going strong.",1
"I bought this product because I noticed my cats were starting to get dandruff. I read online that that omegas really help. So I figured I would try it out. To my surprise my cats LOVE it. It's almost as if they knew they were missing some form of nutrition because as soon as I added it to their food, they ate all their food immediately. Normally they take half a day to eat their food. Also, their dandruff is gone! Their coats are starting to look shiny and healthy. I'm very happy with this product and will continue to use it :)",1
"These are very well made, but might run a little large.  I ordered the extra large for my boxer (who is a good sized girl), and it looks like we could've gone with the large instead.  She gets compliments on this collar almost every time she wears it out.",1
My dog loved the taste of this!,0
I was so happy to find this small size for my little guy. It is easy to use and I feel he is secure and not in danger of getting tangled or break free.,1
"Latest order from August 2016 was obviously a different pill.  I pulled my old bottle from the trash and also noticed the label changed.  The old label  says ""Formulated by Dr. Dawn Curie Thomas, DVM"" and also has a serial number and expiration date.  The new label is missing all these things, but the active ingredients haven't changed.  My two cats used to love them, but now both avoid the pills.",0
"This thing won't hold a 20lb dog like it says.  It's very small and thin lined.  Yes it provides the dimensions, but it's a little difficult to measure my dog's dimensions, so when I saw the weight of 20lbs thought I'd be good.  My Jack Russell is 15 lbs and doesn't come close to fitting.  This is only useful for a yorkie or chihuahua sized pup.",0
"Love it, I have an old english sheepdog who loves to play in the creek daily, creating a headache daily to groom him.  I have tried alot of products and this really works.  Awesome!!!",1
Great product,1
Just received and they are covered in mold!!! I have bought them before and my dog loved them. So disappointed. They are moldy and gross! Scary!,0
MY CATS LOVE IT,1
What I expected,1
It has to be cleaned often.  The filter barely lasted 2 weeks.  The motor is not balanced on the base so the water comes out lopsided.,0
Exactly as described. Perfect for our rabbit,1
"My toy-obsessed corgi got this five days ago, and has been having a great time with it all week. He has managed to tear out two of the squeakers so far, but he is a powerful chewer. He loves whipping the snake around, squeaking it like crazy, and running through the house with it. I'm taking off one star because he really had no problem tearing several holes in it the first day. It's nice not to have stuffing all over, though.",1
Smaller than I was expecting.  Could not use.,0
Dog was sick afterwards and did not work.,0
It is just what Abby (my dog) needed.  I have bought so many other places but they didn't work so I am glad to see there is a place I can find these.  Thanks,1
good to the very last drop,1
"Hands down the very best dog or jogging night time safety light we've ever tried!  Love it so much we bought one in every color.  Use the carabiner attachment and slide on vest straps.  One on dog leash, two on dog vest, two on our sleeves.  Have used them in rain, snow, hot and cold weather.  Have had them for years.  Batteries last a very long time.  Use every night in winter and many nights in summer.  Never any problems.  Just great!",1
Did not work. It was delivered broken.,0
This product was guaranteed and my pup chewed right through it in a matter of a two minute span of having it on. Is not sturdy at all and I can't return it or get a refund. Would not get again or suggest.,0
"One of my cats is very picky about his toys. He prefers chasing wadded up pieces of paper than actual toys usually. But he LOVES this toy! He's a pretty big, really strong cat. Thankfully, unlike most of the other toys I've gotten for him and he actually liked, this one hasn't broken in the 6 months I've had it. Will definitely get this again (if it ever gets too beat up!)",1
They need to improve the design because the grid is flat against the pad. I had to put 3 dow rods between the grate and the pad to lift the grate slightly over the pad.  Pupppy's feet still get wet unless there is something raising the grid ever so slightly. My pup likes to lay on it but prefers to go straight to a puppy pad to potty instead. Good idea but needs improvement.,0
"doesn't close correctly- ramps and platforms are sketchy.
my main issue is that the ramps do not secure into the platforms, they're easily moved, the ramp doesn't even touch the platform securely, there's a gap so it's not completely resting correctly",0
"We love skineez in our household. Anything with stuffing doesn't last a day here, skineez usually hold up the longest and I have two aggressive tuggers, so once they ripped these, they still play with the bodies and tails. Great products from this company, IMO",1
Cats got easily bored. Kinda flimsy. Hard to adjust the mirror correctly so they could see the laser point.,0
So small.,0
My dog fell through it the first day,0
Worse pads I have ever used.  Will never buy that brand again. They had places where there was no covering at all.  DONT BUY THEM.,0
DID NOT WORK....,0
Perfect fabric just wish they were slightly bigger.,1
"it works just fine.  leopard gecko seems quite happy and has no complaints.  it's little, but just enough for him.",1
Hard to get dog hair off mitt. Came with no instructions.,0
"Great price, and great product. We bought lots of other plastic and wood ones that my nervous dog wouldn't use because it made noise or wasn't as sturdy as these. Uses these with no problem.",1
"My greatdane loves this chew toy. He has lots of toys and can rip a part a stuffy ia a few mins . But this has kept him busy for hours
and is still going. Great item!!",1
"Study, holds firmly against pulling- this was tested with two 80+ lb. Great Pyrenees. Great product!",1
"I bought this product since it was 100% made in America, grain-free, and highly rated.  But my dog couldn't adjust to it.  I tried this one, and the Buffalo too.  Same results...messy poops :-(
I think it's just different dogs have different digestive system sensitivities.  Not a reflection of the food, just my experience with it.  I have found another brand that works well that is grain-free, although not 100% sourced in the US...so still looking for that.

Recommendation:  Try it as an option.",0
Absolutely amazing and works wonderfully. Sad we got them AFTER our cats destroyed the carpet. This has helped to not let them damage the carpet anymore than they did before we got these.,1
Much larger than expected but will still work on vest,1
"Excellent quality, my beauties love them.",1
We have used Iams biscuits for many years.  This box turned to powder green mold and had to be thrown away.  We probably got to use 5 lbs. of the 20.  Very dissatisfied.,0
The shoe sizes were way way way off. I ordered a medium and it look like an XXS. They are not true to size at all!!,0
Really simple design that works really well. Folds flat. I can also hinge it together to make a gate of sorts for the deck/outside. Really like it.,1
Very dry and musty smelling. Hard on gums for my older lab dog.,0
"though it says 100 watt, a light bulb gives off way more heat. Maybe I got a bum one, but it does not put out much heat at all. I am going to buy one locally and compare. If there is a difference, I may update this review with the new information.",0
"Extremely small, way to small to every play tug or war with.",0
"The best way to get a solid wave-making device on a budget.  Works great with the evolution pumps, but will switch any brand of pump.",1
"Great Product, but you can get the same quantities from the manufacturer's store for almost half the price.",0
Save your money.,0
Greatest pads I've bought on amazon. Super absorbent,1
My chihuahua loves lamb chews but didn't want anything to do with these.  I am giving 2 stars just in case my dog may be a bit on the fussy side,0
Our dog licked it off in less than 3 minutes. I barely got it on him and he started to lick it. I hope you have much better luck.,0
Worked wonders in 3 days my dog was calmer and had stop braking at every little thing. Plus walks are easier,1
"I've had two of these, the battery died each time after about two days. I bought a Duracell lithium battery for it, which works great. As far as it working, it did NOTHING for my great pyrenees, he just barks non stop, doesn't even pay it any attention. Rated it two stars cause of the battery.",0
"Finally, after 3 tries I got something my dog with use to jump up on the bed on.",1
"Bought medium, the  worms were much bigger than expected(based on previous experience with other brand's black soldier fly larvae) Not a bad thing, they are fat, ivory and wriggly, my beardie likes them! Maybe next I'll see what the large looks like.

Edit: These guys are so big, that even though they're phoenix worm-shaped, I wonder if they're really black soldier flies. I did find one worm yesterday that seemed to be rotten? It was super limp and squashy, and while it's normal for these guys to go black when they're ready to pupate, this was nothing like those I've seen(they usually get quite stiff)
Regardless of type, my baby beardie has stopped eating them, only eats one when REALLY hungry, out of the ten or so I put out. I won't be buying these again.",0
"I wanted a soft carrier so that I could fold it up and stash it when it wasn't needed. This fits that rather well.

It has plenty of ventilation so I'm not worried about my cat feeling too cramped or running into other issues. It is a bit of a tight fit to me for my 10lb kitty...However that said, I got it out of the box, opened the one side and set it on the floor, he immediately ran over curiously, sniffed it out, climbed in and laid down. So apparently he doesn't think it is too tight and that's what matters. I'm gonna leave it out and open for a few days just so he can get used to it.

Pros:
-Good, tough, quality material and stitching from what I can tell.
-Shoulder strap and hand-carry handle.
-Seat belt straps to keep it secure in the car.
-Very open ventilation wise.
-Nice top zipper so you can reach in and pet/treat your pet.
-Double zippers on the end clip together so that it can't come unzipped accidentally.
-Bed comes apart for cleaning.
-Extra Pocket space
-Cat likes it.

Cons:
-I did think the rigid board at the bottom was just going to be solid plastic, it seems to be what is probably plastic wrapped wood like a lot of other carriers. Not a big deal, I just personally would have preferred a solid HDPE board or something (I can always order one from TapPlastics cut to size later if I want)
-End structure doesn't recover it's form quite as well as I'd like after being folded in the packaging, but also not a big deal. It doesn't have to look perfectly arched it's a pet carrier.",1
"If your cat likes to play with water, then this is not that good. It's because the second step's hole is big enough to go through and play with toilet water!!",0
"Cheap quality!! The brush came apart in first use!! My dog hates the gel whereas the previous brand we used, he loved it so brushing his teeth was easier.",0
"I ordered two sets of thes in size L and XL for my dogs (Lab and Lab mix).  The XL was too small when I tried it on my Jack Russell Terrier.  There is no return option.  Lesson Learned...wasted money. Also, the ""halter straps don't work.  Dogs don't have people shoulders....slide right off.  Would look cute on a tiny human toddler with a tail.",0
. My cat didn't like them after the catnip that they provide oral she didn't care about them I will be returning them as well,0
I was not impressed with this product at all. I mixed it a little strong and it first it seemed to work but the smell returned in full force within two days.,0
excellent products,1
Do not stick to the sill.  Falls off no matter what you do!,0
"With two cats, I had come to the decision (one that I have never regretted) to leave the litter box duties to technology. Or as much of those duties as non-humanly possible. That decision lead me to the LitterMaid LM700, not a perfect solution by any measure but still a useful convenience and a very good thing for peace of mind during short trips out of town.

Now, with four cats, one of them being, shall we say, extra large, perhaps some new version of the technology was in order. Enter the LitterMaid Elite Mega. If you're not already familiar with these contraptions, er, technological wonders, they work like this: you fill the box with clumping litter, the cat enters and breaks an invisible beam of light starting a timer that, in 10 minutes time, hopefully rakes the waste into a bin under a hinged lid. At least that's the plan.

New features of the Elite Mega compared to the LM700:
- Extra roomy litter box for larger cats
- Quiet timer to disable motorized scooping during the night; great for apartments
- Removable metal rake that easy to clean
- Automatic ionizer odor zapper

The LitterMaid Elite Mega actually looks rather sleek done in silver and gray. I was rather surprised the plastic was a softer variety - more like a simple litter pan than the hard plastic of the LM700. There's also a red glowing LED clock and some buttons for power and clock settings. The buttons are cheap-microwave style push buttons. The Elite Mega also has an easily removable METAL rake instead of the of plastic, a welcome improvement.

Setting up the LitterMaid Elite Mega was an easy process requiring no tools basically just sliding a few bits into slots and installing a plastic waste bin and plugging the power adapter in. It is recommended that you spray the litter pan with silicon or non-stick cooking spray beforehand. You will also want to install 8 AA batteries as a backup power source, to maintain the clock setting but, most importantly, to make sure the unit powers ON after a power outage. Yes, even if you have no use for the clock and quiet timer and even if you don't care about automatic scooping during a power outage, YOU MUST INSTALL 8 AA BATTERIES OTHERWISE THE UNIT WILL STAY OFF AFTER A POWER OUTAGE.

In operation, the Elite Mega more or less does the job. There are a few things which are a bit annoying about the device though. For one thing, the motor is very loud. I suspect its a bit underpowered hearing how much louder it gets when the rake meets the litter. The larger litter tray is also shallower which, even with a coating of silicon spray, seems to cause more clumps to stick to the tray than with the smaller, deeper models. Clumps also tend to push more dry litter into into the waste tray requiring emptying more often -- in my household with 4 cats (one outdoor), the LM700 waste tray needed emptying every 5-6 days while the Elite Mega lasts 4 days (other litter boxes available in both cases). Furthermore, an odd design feature allows some amount of litter behind the resting point of the rake and waste can sometimes work behind it. And the nice sleek silver and gray finish isn't so nice looking when coated with dust from litter. The most annoying feature is having to install 8 AA batteries otherwise you have to manually turn the units power ON after a power outage.

That may sound fairly damning but, still, the Elite Mega does the job if you don't mind checking it and maybe scooping once a day. What, you still have to scoop!? Yes, perhaps, but just some muddy stuff that gets stuck to the bottom. (Maybe I should have gone with the Pam cooking spray instead of silicon?) Even with these drawbacks, I believe the Elite would be perfect for an apartment dweller with a small to extra large cat or anyone else who needs the unit to stay off and quiet during the night. If you don't need the quiet timer, however, you might want to look at the less expensive LM700 model instead.",1
Great product and company even if it was pricey. We had to return one after it broke unexpectedly. They you company rapidly refunded us. Because of the customer service we reordered another chair for our service dog. Thank you...,1
Four paws dog leashes are trash junk do not buy this product. I bought three of them and all are broken. I adopted my pup from the humane society November 22 2014. The third one broke August 11 2015.,0
This wire came in one large tangled ball. With in the first few rounds of attempting to untangle we discovered the wire came in very short lengths. 20 feet approximately.  Not at all suitable for the targeted sale and our intended use. (pet safe dog fence) We returned it as unusable. I would never recommended this product or this seller if this is how they operate. 1 star only because you have to give st least one.,0
"We purchased the Petsafe underground system for our two Saint Bernards. The system is working OK but the nylon collars are not durable.  Both colors have broken due to the plastic clip.  We came home to find our dogs on the highway, thankfully they did not get hurt. Now, not only do we have to replace their collars ( we are using the system in a more durable collar that we are purchasing separately) but we have to replace the receiving unit as well because half of it is lost.  Very disappointed as these are not inexpensive and my dogs could have gotten badly hurt or worse.",0

My dog HATED this headcollar! I have a 115lb Pressa Canario who is all muscle. He is a severe puller when I attempted to walk him and would almost rip my arm off when he got too excited. I took my time introducing him to this headcollar and used treats to support my efforts. When I attempted to walk him he went crazy! He became obsessed with attempting to remove it - trying to use his paws and then finally he began scraping his muzzle and head along the ground. He will not go near the collar if I hold it up and will bark and back away. He refused to walk for a day or two and wouldn't even accept a treat. I tried a harness on him and it worked like a charm. It may just be my dog who had such a severe response but I cannot recommend this headcollar.,0
i really liked the look of this collar on my gray kitty. But when he scratches his neck the collar repeatedly has come unclasped and it falls off. I need to find a better option. This one cost too much to not work well. Disappointing,0
We bought this item for our dog to use during long car trips where she sits in our back seat.  She LOVES it.  It gets warm but not too warm so if she is sitting on my lap it doesn't get too hot for my legs.  This was a great purchase for her.,1
"I thought this was a big bag of dog food and a food bowl.  It is a very small bag of dog food and a cheap plastic food bowl.  Maybe I didn't read the

"I had to return both petmate kennels. There 24in appeared to be way too small for my cats. 2 kittens would be comfortable in this,not an average size cat, there would be no room to turn around. In addition, this website doesn't seem to offer a larger size. After informing Amazon of the insufficiant kennel size for one cat,it appears that they're preparing to ship out the same 24in that i just returned. I only had this item for an hour but I could see right away when I opened the package that it would be way too small for my cats. Unfortunately this review can't include my experience using it since I just got it. But I can say that it looks like a solid piece of construction. My only issue was the small size.",0

"We tried choke collars to no avail... our active, enthusiastic hound/shepard mix constantly yanked at her leash.  We also tried the harness that goes around the dog's chest but it was a hassle to get on and off and, while it helped a little, she soon began pulling again.  We followed the directions to acclimate her to the Gentle Leader and at first she resisted but now loves it because it signals walk time.  It cured her of all pulling and now even without the leader, she does not pull.  Very easy to get on and off her.",1
"I really like this  dog sweater vs. the other one we purchased since it covers the entire length of the dogs back,  from neck all teh way to base of tail. Appears well made, good material with just enough stretch to it. Easy to put on and off and it makes her feel extra sassy when she wears it. Good solid buy, highly recommended.",1
If you have a large dog I would suggest getting a bigger size. The large size looked more like a medium or small.,0
the buckle is stitched backwards and can't be fixed. I ended up buying one at a pet store.,0
My red footed tortoises didn't like it. It also arrived in one big chunk. I guess it melted all together.,0
"when I went to use it  the first time over 1/2 the bottle leaked out. was damaged when I received it. I did not know unit I started spraying . a waste of my money. now on the other had it might have been good don't know but that is how I fell. I think I should get another one with no charges at all
dream on right???",0
This color is very sturdy and fits great! The orange is more of a neon but I enjoy and my dog doesn't seem to mind ;)!,1
quality product excellent price!,1
Lasted a good while. Dog ate it to a little nub when I threw it out. Recommend again.,1
"Not good! The primary ingredient is corn, which is bad for cats, dogs, cows, and other animals, but food makers like to use because it's cheap!  Don't be fooled.  Does it make sense for your cat to have clean teeth and give them food that's not good for them? I don't think so!",0
Cats love it,1
"We shopp3d around and for the price this is a great product. Helps keep the area clean and looks good. Love the size, very large and it fits in the corner nicely",1
"Hahaha,this is a midget bone!!!",0
CAUTION MADE IN CHINA!!! I'd returned these if I had not destroyed the box. Company assured me that they have a stringent quality control. These were thrown away.,0
"The collar for this lead will not stay up around the dog's ears as recommended for maximum control of your dog by Cesar Millan - it falls to the dog's neck, which per Cesar, actually encourages the dog to pull you.",0
"After only one week all of my dogs have softer, shinier fur. Works great.",1
My dogs really like theses this is about the 3rd time Ive purchased them,1
Cheap material with rough edges.  Cheesy crome clasp.,0
way too small!,0
Thanks all good 5 stars!!,1
"Never had any trouble with fleas or ticks using this, plus it doesn't smell.  My wife couldn't stand the scent of the brand that our vet was selling us (they used to sell this brand before it became available as over-the-counter).",1
"It worked well for awhile (3 months or so) then It started to leak out water a little at a time, now it pumps it out of the cracks just about as fast as you pour it in. I like ExoTerra but I do not like this waterfall. Keep your money and try to find a better unit, I will.",0
"I bought this for my French bulldog, and in terms of sizing it is perfect. However, after every walk, the front gets loosened up and I have to retighten it. And my dog isn't much of a puller either. I thought that the fact that this didn't have a martingale contraption in the front would make it better, but it seems a little awkward when pulling on the side. As far as mitigating pulling, it does do it's job better than a regular collar, but I'm not sure it's enough.",0
"Really bummed on this purchase, poor quality...Was hoping for something at least closer to the beds I purchase from Costco as they haven't carried this style lately.  Waste of money.",0
Great price chicken love them good quality,1
Looks great with my 68 pound Pit's tutu costume-she looks so cute!,1
Part of my cat litter box system. Perfect,1
Perfect height and good quality.,1
This is a great product for dog owners. The ability to covert a sliding door to allow dog access is great.,1
"Strong product, more rigid than even expected.  I used these to pin down my game fencing.  Luckily I bought extra now that I see how many other applications these would be helpful.",1
Cat loves it,1
"It works well, but unfortunately has to be used often so my dog with dry skin couldn't tolerate being bathed that often.  There was always random straggler fleas but every flea this touched was dead or at least dying. It's a really food flea shampoo but for large outbreaks it won't solve everything. In which case monthly flea treatment and home flea spray is necessary",1
I ordered this to replace a small deer antler for my Chocolate Lab.  The thing is huge and my dog loves it!!! He has spent hours rolling on the floor and left my kid's toys alone.  I will be buying more of these in the future.,1
"No leak, works good
The only problem is that during night when my bunny drinks water is a little bit too loud.",1
Stellar. My dog still sheds but much less. She doesn't fight it either so that's great. Worth the money to avoid the hassle of hair everywhere.,1
Works great but feeds too much on lowest sitting.,1
My dog absolutely loves these!,1
Really really VERY WELL MADE! I use the tag with the dog on my keychain so it is known that I have a Service DOG. The other tag is on his collar. I have bought several other tags and NONE of them are as nice as these! The engraving is very well made and easily read. Just quality made. Thanks so much!,1
My dog won't ingest it at all!,0
"My cats got this around Christmas time last year, and as I write this review it has been used for close to 3 months.

First of all, one cat loves it.  I have the scratching post sitting in front of a window and she always would sit on top of the post.  Therefore I decided to make it a bit more accommodating for her.  Remarkably she even began SLEEPING on it.  It was also one great added feature for her to climb up the post to get to.  As other reviewers have stated, it IS small, she's a 13 pound cat (healthy weight), and she was comfortable on it.

Here are the CONS that cost it 3 stars:
- The pad is held on by velcro ""stickers"" that are affixed to the bottom of the base, which is lacquered like the rest of the perch.  From there, velcro straps reach around and attach to them.  It doesn't take a genius to realize a sticker on a lacquered surface won't stick long term.  Within a matter of 2 weeks the straps were no longer holding, rather disappointing given how sturdy the post is!  Because the pad is so ineffectively attached, it slides around when my cat tries to climb up on it.  It's gotten to the point that she doesn't trust climbing up that way.

- The perch itself slides onto the top of the post and is assumedly going to stay there by using TWO flimsy plastic pieces that rotate into place (another reviewer has added picture of them.  These were good, until one uninformed friend moved it around, and the plastic pieces were promptly bent permanently.

FIXES for these cons:
- Forego the straps all together.  It's not worth it.  Rather sand the top of the perch (yes, remove all of that shiny appeal), and attach the pad via better means wether that be by velcro underneath the pad itself, snaps for easy removal, or perhaps a combination of the two.  Sanding down the top will also reduce the tendency for the pad to want to slide around.

- Remove the plastic pieces that are supposed to ""secure"" the perch to the top, they will NOT last.  Luckily, there are screw holes right there on either side!  Take a piece of scrap wood and screw that into both ends of the perch.

VOILA!  But honestly, for the price on a product that needs so many improvements, the company should address these issues on their own.

*****HALF YEAR UPDATE*****
Rather than do any of my suggested fixes, I just took my trusty hot glue gun and made the pad a permanent fixture on the perch.  No further fuss, no muss.  It's worked great!  I just take a lint roller to it periodically.  I still think for the money these issues should be addressed and it doesn't warrant an upgrade in stars.",0
We ordered three of these collars and all three did not work within the first month of having the collar.  We will never order this product again.  Definitely not worth the money.,0
"Tried this on our 10 yr old Dachshund for over 3 weeks, even with 2 sets of brand-new batteries. Our dog has incredible sense of smell, but only very good hearing. Perhaps a dog with ears that don't cover the ear canals and with incredible hearing will respond better, but I still can't imagine it causing any discomfort to the dog and correcting behavior given our experience.

PROS:

-None.

CONS:

-Dog hardly even notices the thing, even at extremely close proximity. (We did some tests and with it right up to his ear, he acknowledges it half the time but can easily tune it out.)
-Goes off all the time while we're watching TV for no reason. (It's clear that certain frequencies set it off, not the act of barking itself...so it's a really dumb sensing mechanism and will kill the batteries quickly and send corrections for no reason.....not good!)
-Doesn't work whatsoever.",0
This works great fro keeping the back seat clean from kids messes. The seatbelts fit through fine and I was able to get it nice and tight in the back of our Subaru.,1
"This product contains a chemical (Paradichlorobenzene) which emits fumes that are harmful to birds. The active ingredient is meant to be used in closed airtight spaces to kill moths and, perhaps, other insects. Birds who do not go outdoors are rarely (if ever) affected by parasites and the active ingredient can easily be harmful to your bird. If your bird seems ""off"" take the bird to a competent avian veterinarian who sees only birds or birds & other exotics or (at a minimum) to a vet with significant experience treating birds.",0
Exactly what I was looking for and a great price. The guide that came along with the containers was very helpful and explained how to use them as well as what foods are acceptable.,1
Nyla bones for the win....again!,1
"my dog hates it, the smell is not very helpful neither.",0
Extremely overpriced,0
"They are a nice chew snack for our 2 border collies the dogs love them, a good quality and last for a couple hours.",1
"These pads are amazing! My tiny pomeranian was trained on these pads with no coaxing in one day! I have had no problems with leaks, and they have a nice, fresh smell. (At least at first!) The price is right, the product is great!",1
"The product did say what the purpose of these male diapers do for dogs who pee with excitement and what not.
It didn't fit my maltipoo, the diaper just kept rotating and doesn't stay put no matter how tight the strap was under my dogs torso.",0
Sank to the bottom and died,0
My horse loves these! They last a while too,1
Great leash and very functional. Not great durability on the rubber parts.,0
Love it,1
"At first I was thrilled. Aside from some minor complaints(pulling wasn't fully eliminated, just toned down) this appeared to be the first harness that fit my dog correctly and helped curb her pulling. I did not use it a lot at first because of it being the middle of winter and very cold. In the last couple weeks (the weather has been unseasonably warm for the most part) we've been using it almost daily. I began to notice that when hooked in the front the harness pulled to one side and would rub under her one leg, it wasn't bad at first and didn't seem to bother her. I went and bought a leash splitter for walking two dogs on one leash(basically what the leash piece for the harness seems to be) again that seemed to help, until today when I noticed the front was again not staying in place, and was rubbing. Halfway through our walk my dog began whining for no reason. I looked and didn't see a problem so we continued. When I got home and took the harness off, it had injured her chest. It looks like it pinched the front of her chest just in front of her leg. (She'd been pulling hard just before she whined) I will never use this harness again. See pictures for injury and fit problems.",0
Been using this brand on my dog since I first adopted her and she has had 0 problems with ticks or fleas. I would recommend.,1
"This is an excellent food. We did find it had a bit too much protein for our pup, an Australian Labradoodle. I think some of the breeds such as Huskies, Danes, Shepherds, and such process the extra protein better. We are sticking with Merrick just going to the Grain Free Chicken and Sweet Potato Puppy.",1
"These make having an indoor cat so much easier. I ran out of these liners for about a month and was so glad to get back to them, again. They fit high-backed covered litter boxes great.",1
donated this to the shelter I volunteer at the kittens went crazy.,1
"I really love this thing.  It's made a huge difference with control of our dog and his pulling.  We had it fitted by the trainer as frankly we really didn't know how it should fit.  It's a bit awkward with the hook being in the front because sometimes it gets across his body, but would definitely buy it again.",1
"Lint rollers were extremely cheaply made. Papers were difficult to tear off, and handle broke off during first use-- I now have to roll the paper rolls using my fingers. Not particularly efficient or effective.",0
"My dogs absolutely love this toys, perfect for small dogs!",1
I looked at other reviews and pictures before buying product. We just got 4 baby turtles on Wednesday night by thursday evening the water is a cloudy and gross looking. I have less than 5 gallons of water in the tank as well,0
must prefer silicone base product as it stays pliable longer than vinyl,1
"Very disappointed in this toy. It was listed as being heavy duty and it was not. Gave it to a mini lab and it lasted about 5 minutes, literally. He tore it apart.",0
If you have never put your little dog in pj's you are missing out.  These were the cutest thing I have ever seen.,1
Broken bark switch and missing piece from battery compartment. Totally useless.  Zero,0
While I think this is a very good quality product I wish the neck was adjustable because our puppies big head just BARELY fits through. If you have a breed with a big noggin you may want to consider the next size up.,1
Good quality product for a good price and it's organic! I am fully aware of the benefits of turmeric and have been using it for both myself and my dogs for sometime. However I purchased this product for our two dogs because it has turmeric and the hip and joint all in one tablet. Its only been a couple of weeks but they have been taking it in their food with no problem. I am receiving a FREE Complimentary bottle of the product.,1
Love it. And super fast shipping! Thanks,1
It seems to work great.,1
These pads have been the best pads we have bought thus far. Unfortunately living in Massachusetts its hard to get our dog to go outside during the winter so we buy pads and give her a spot to do her business. But she would always miss the pads we bought so she knew what to do the pads just weren't big enough. Once I ordered these pads and receieved them we were shocked at how big they were so we have been able to cover an ever bigger area for our dog and she's done well. Plus they have been super absorbent as she will pie several times on one pad and nothing gets through. Will be buying again once the others run low. I highly recommend these to anyone who has a home or apartment with carpet thats trying to train their dog,1
My Ring Neck would not touch it. I purchase Cuttlebone at the local pet store that my bird would use.,0
My dog loves these!!,1
"This litter box is used by my 4 house rabbits. My rabbits are only ~4 lbs each so quite small, and the bottom of the opening is about at their chin level. However, they have no problem hopping in, doing their business, eating hay, etc. inside. The box is a nice large size with plenty of headroom and ventilation in the back as well. I've seen two or more rabbits sitting in it at the same time comfortably. The high lip also prevents litter from being kicked out.

While it very clearly looks like a litter box, the shape is attractive and hides the actual litter from view, so it isn't an eyesore in my room that has white furniture.",1
"Very pretty and fits perfect. I like the weight, it's very light",1
My cat wouldn't use the crystal litter and was afraid of the box,0
I love this dog towel! It dries quickly and gets the job done. I couldn't be happier with it and I would highly recommend it for all dog owners.,1
"I don't review a lot of things. But this litter scoop deserves it. I don't know why, but I like it better and it works better than any of my other litter scoops. I have 3 cats. I know about these things.",1
I couldn't get to the store all the time to grab live crickets but these did the trick. My dragon loves live crickets and I never tried freeze dried crickets but she seems to enjoy these with her Lettuce and Carrots :-),1
"What I received was tiny! It could maybe hold a cup of food, not 16oz.",0
Works well but takes time getting dog adjusted to wearing it. My dog is really well behaved but I wanted to train her not to sniff in public and this allows more control without needing an e-collar. Well made and simple to use.,1
These liners fit my cages perfectly and are substantial enough that one sheet does the job. I am happy.,1
Not a fan,0
excellent price. Last for one month each,1
"Adorable! A lot smaller than I expected for the price, but they were cute and my pup loved them!",1
"These collars are holes in my dogs' skin. They do not work and will burn your pet. I am paying over $1000 in vet bills for all three of my dogs. The wore them at night only while I was at work to keep them from disrupting the neighbors and, within a week, they had brown through the skin and created a hole in their necks. DO NOT purchase these bark collars.",0
"I have male cocker spaniel and he has always seemed a little skittish. He sleeps with his eyes kind of open, he's a good boy but is very nervous.  I wanted to give him Lexapro for his anxiety ....honestly haha.  In a last attempt I started looking for natural supplements for him because I didn't want the chemicals in his body.  I found the MaxxiCalm by chance on amazon.  This stuff is GREAT!!!!!  I give him 1/2 tablet daily.  He weighs 25 lbs.  I noticed a difference right away in his general behavior.  He's more relaxed, anxiety has decreased at least 50%, he's more friendlier, loving and a general pleasure.  I would definitely recommend this product. I have a new dog thanks to MaxxiClam",1
"I loved the color, the size of the handle and the length of the leash. Unfortunately, the grip started to peel off after about a month and the leash tore off after 6 month. Very dissapointed!",0
Due to lack of structure the cats don't realize it has an opening. They sleep on top of it.,0
"This is described as a memory foam bed. It is nothing more than foam fill and doesn't lay flat, is very lumpy. My dog has arthritis and hip desplacia and this is terribly uncomfortable. Other memory foam beds he has had were wonderful, but this was very disappointing.",0
Don't buy this or any other K & H product.  Their customer support after the sale is non-existent!  You can't get replacement parts if something breaks.  Never heard of anything like that in my life.  I'd give negative 5 starts if it was possible,0
My 2 German shepard puppies love these.,1
"My dog is 20lbs and this bow tie combo is so small you can barely see it on him.  He's not even that fuzzy!  He's got an 11 inch neck and thankfully I read the other reviews and switched my order from 11"" to the 14"" size.  It's SMALL!!  The 14"" fits his neck perfect.  Not an inch of movement.  I expected the Bow Tie and collar to be larger, it's TINY.  It's too late for me to order another set from somewhere else but it sucks.  This combo is probably perfect on the tiny dogs, 10 lbs or less but not over that.  It's smaller than the palm of your hand.  I was looking for something that you would be able to see when you held the dog up for photos.  This way, we'll have to hold his head up too.",0
Did NOT remove pet hair as advertised.,0
"One year later, my aussie is still crazy about this bone. It really holds up well and a small smear of peanut butter in the center has kept my pup obsessed with this bone. Great chew toy, will definitely give to other pup owners as a gift!",1
It was really nice size unfortunately i did not read JUMBO part of it haha. it was really nice but to big for my Conure. Im going to have to return it. the quality looks good though with a nice base.,1
"LOVE this jacket!  Perfect weight, fit, quality.",1
"This shampoo is AWESOME!!!!! I have several dogs with different skin and coat texture.... This shampoo is so concentrated and really cleans with great lather... Don't have to use much at all when lathering which is such a plus with a multiple dog family''
I love the fact that it is all organic and no harsh chemicals are being used.... My dogs tend to have itchy skin from being outside in the grass while playing.... This AWESOME shampoo soothes their skin and relieves their itchiness which is GREAT'",1
My dog ignores the grass patch and pees on the deck next to it. We may as well not have it.,0
"These have been a lifesaver, especially for my small 5-pound Chihuahua. He can go a few days on one pad probably about 10 times!!",1
"Awesome design, and very nice looking! Like it better than the ones at pet stores!",1
The leg part of these socks were way too small for my pooch.  I couldn't get them on.  The paw part of the sock would have worked fine if I could have gotten them on.,0
Not work at all! Waste of money!,0
Bought a month ago but just went to use today and it's sewn crooked :( too late to exchange. We have a previous one from this company that we love!,0
Best way to clean a tank - cleaning my 30 gallon is A LOT easier now.,1
Works perfect for our little guy.,1
"Not worth the price at all. Your better better off investing in a better quality product for the extra 10-15 bucks.
  Box came banged up and cover itself, looked used and scratched.
  Kept it anyway thinking my dog would do the same eventually.
HOWEVER the straps broke, plastic snapped and the zipper ripped all by the second use.
Might be ok for someone with a 15lb dog but not for anything over that.",0
"hard to use unless there's a couple of people helping, Just freaked my cats out ,gave it to a friend.",0
Really works. Great generic product. Great price.,1
Doesn't fit on a normal size can and the plastic is inferior,0
This is a GREAT product.  It takes a couple seconds to get the hang of it.  I see some wright ups where people say it doesn't work right.  Not sure why this isn't working for them.  You can throw long high fly bombs down field or you can snap the ball so it bounces across the yard really fast.  My dog loves this thing.  So do I.  The balls are a new addiction as well.  He will chew on them for hours if we let him.,1
"My dog's nose is too short to keep this on--she is a Jack Russell Terrier ""shortie"", about 15 pounds. When adjusted as instructed, with the neck-band as tight as instructed, the nose band always can be slipped off unless it is so tight that she can't open her mouth.",0
"This did not work from the start.  When the batteries were installed the LED light did not come on so it could not be programmed at all.
When I tried to return it, they offered me 60% off to keep it (why would I want something that didn't work at any cost?)
Also, they would not pay the return shipping...THIS IS BIG if the product is broken!
So,  It cost me!!!",0
"West Paw dog toys are awesome! They are super durable and it they get damaged, the company stands behind their warranty!",1
dog bit right through it,0
This started to cause my 2 year old lab to vomit several times the next couple of days. I feel its dangerous for the lining of his stomach since it is chewed into sharp pieces.,0
Cost efficient bags. Perforations and end seals good.,1
"My dog loves these , she won't eat without it .",1
"So I like it.  Hey-as long as they eat something, and it's not packed with a bunch of bi-products, I'm pretty happy about it.",1
Overpriced for what you get. My little 10 pound dog won't sit on it anymore because the feet don't lock open and the thing collapses when she goes to sit on it or moves around on it. If the box wasn't thrown out by mistake I would have returned it. Only thing good about it is it folds. It's a pain to set it down on the ground while making sure all the legs are fully opened up.,0
Works awesomely!,1
Exactly what I wanted.  Excellent service.,1
My doggy loves these treats.,1
"THIS IS A GOOD QUALITY HEAVY DUTY BOX.  THE CATS LOVE IT.  SPRINKLE CAT NIP IN IT AND THEY PLAY FOR HOURS, SLEEP IN IT TOO.  GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY!",1
"I originally bought this cage for my finches so that they would have a bigger cage to fly around in. When the product arrived, it contained 2 broken perches of the 3, and a bunch of parts without a manual on how to assemble it. Overall, I'm disappointed with it because the hours it took me to assemble would have been unnecessary had I gotten the cage elsewhere.",0
"I bought this product for a cockatiel I rescued. He is a feather plucker and when I got him his body was almost bare. I tried this product and within a few days he was calm and not plucking anymore. He still plucks now and then but lbefore it was terrible. I told my vet if he starts to

bleed I want him to be euthanized. Sounds
terrible doesn't it? I cannot see a bird suffer like
this but if you try this product you will be
amazed at how well it works for your feather
plucker. I can't thank the seller and not for creating this wonderful product.",1
"This is one of the few things I've tried (and I have tried a lot of different things, in liquid, pill and treat form) that calms my boy when a storm is approaching, when the evil lawnmower men are about, when his nemesis the garbage truck is around, or when we go in the car. And he likes the flavor a lot.

My only complaints are that the bag is not even half full when it arrives, and that it can be found for a better price elsewhere online.",1
This product was defective when I received it...the lid was damaged and would not seal.,0
My 3 month old kitten broke out on only the second use. This thing is dangerous.,0
Cats lick the gravy and leave the rest.  Also has less food in it than the other fancy feast cans,0
Don't get for cats. The chews are huge for a cat. One of my cats wouldn't touch it. The other tried it when I broke a chew into pieces.,0
"Clippers work really well! All the guards provide for a lot of options for length. My only concern has been that the clipper motor seems to get really hot when I've been using it for a while. It still works and I am still able to touch it, but I feel like the ""danger"" of overheating is real.",1
I hope these were safe if eaten. My dog had it for around 3 days before it just disappeared. I was hoping they were more durable,0
"it really seems to help, it does run small so if in doubt order the next larger size, but it really does help my dog with the thunder strorms, fireworks will be the big test!",1
"I like these little finger brushes for my small dogs. They are easy to use, not abrasive and as far as cleaning, I simply rinse them thoroughly in the sink after each use and toss them in the dryer for 10 minutes. It's easy, it works and it's stress free.",1
It quit working after a few weeks,0
Pups loved them..I. bought the ones advertised on tv. These are about the same. Good buy.,1
"My husband laughed when I pulled this out and said our 20 pound hunter cat would never use it.  Since the day after christmas, the cat has not left it except to go outside or eat.  If he is inside, he's in the cat house.  Would like it a little bigger, but it's effective as is.  Cat gives it 2 paws up!",1
"This sticks out REALLY far on either side of the surface.  Figure an additional 2"" on either side. This means your pet has to navigate at least 6"" of tunnel.  Plus, the design allows snow to collect on the top of the outside ledge.  Not pleased with the design.",0
"i was amazed at how quickly my order arrived. also, i was pleased that the product was packaged in small easily managed bags. both cats and dogs like this food.",1
"I gave this two stars because it's made of poor quality.  My cats love it, but when they use it, little pieces of the material go all over the place and make a mess.  I do have four cats and plenty of other scratching posts, but I wanted some ""flat"" ones.  I would not buy these again because they don't last long after they start using them.",0
I have four cats and not one is interested in this toy.  Sent it back.,0
"Great light that gives good color to my fish and my tank. So far, it is holding up fine. Popped right in and worked well. Color as expected, but keep in mind that it is Day White.",1
"When the play pen arrived it was missing one of the Velcro tabs to hold the door up. A few months of use (only a couple hours here and there) and the stitching has come out of one of the panels, now there's an opening large enough for my dog to get out. Very disappointed, we had a pen similar to this for years and never had a problem.",0
"In my search for a healthful food my cats really love and will thrive on, I've tried giving them many different premium brands of cat foods...grain free, and using only animal proteins (no plant proteins like soy products). My cats have sampled brands that include vegetables and sometimes rice, but no other grains in the recipe. I've done taste test trials on them comparing other brands with Fussy Cat.  My cats (adults as well as weaned kittens) absolutely prefer the Fussy Cat Chicken & Tuna recipe. In comparison to the other Fussy Cat flavors, the Chicken & Tuna takes top honors with my cats.

After doing research on cat (and dog) diets, I agree with the results of recent studies that conclude that cats (and dogs) are biologically evolved dedicated carnivores who require animal based proteins.  Therefore I avoid, as much as possible, cat (and dog) foods that use plant based proteins, grains, and plant based fillers.  Plant proteins do not contain all the essential amino acids that carnivores like cats (and dogs) require. Additionally, plant proteins are difficult for cats (and dogs) to digest. Over time the difficulty and stress on the animal's digestive system can result in health issues and a shorter life span.

Bearing in mind that animal protein quality is diminished with high temperature cooking (used in preparing dry kibble and most canned pet foods), I supplement my cats' Fussy Cat meals with some cooked organic egg yolk, and sometimes with an added tablespoon of raw organic beef hamburger (sold at Costco in Novato, CA).  To ensure their fur remains soft and shiny, I always add to their food the contents of a 1000mg capsule of Pure Alaska Omega brand 100% Natural Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil.  Just puncture the capsule and squeeze the contents onto their food and stir thoroughly.

I take my animals to a holisitic veterinarian (Pamela Bouchard, DVM of Tender Care Veterinary Hospital, San Rafael, CA), who strongly believes that diet is an essential foundation for maintaining optimum health and longevity in animals. With each bi-annual check-up, we review the diet of each of my pets. Depending on the results of the always thorough exam (including blood work, etc.), my veterinarian may recommend certain supplements and holistic remedies tailored to meet each pet's requirements.

Now if I could find a human medical doctor who would do the same for me with as much care and compassion, I'd be a happy cat.",1
Not very heavy duty.  It is not the quality of the item it was to replace,0
"I liked the size of this litter box as it is narrow and fits in the small space between the wall and the washing machine. However, I notice that litter gets stuck up on the top of the lid. I thought that was the whole point of the holes in the top. I honestly am not that happy with it but I haven't found another top entry cat litter box that would fit in my small space. I have attached a photo and you can kind of see the litter at the top. I have had other top entry boxes that didn't have this problem.",0
"Purchased this in a pinch at a local drug store. At first, it seemed to work. After giving a second dose days after the original dose (whereas the instructions advise ""every 12 hours""), it did not help and made the situation worse, bothering our dog's already sensitive digestive system. His stomach started loudly growling shortly after taking it and for over six hours afterwards. The #4 ingredient is sorbitol. Sorbitol has laxative properties and can cause stomach cramping and diarrhea. Why is this in the top 5 ingredients of an ""Anti Diarrhea"" product? An aside: the product has an American flag on it and is advertised as ""Made in the USA...with globally souced ingredients."" Misleading. I bought into the ""natural care, veterinary tested"" product design on the front of the bottle and I'm sorry I gave this to my pet.",0
I have only had this collar a couple of weeks and the design is already faded. Not very happy with this purchase.,0
Very durable he chews on it all day.,1
"you have to mix with water and my dog hated it. total waste of money for me. but if you have a dog who will eat anything, than it could be a good fit for you.",0
excellent brush! it took so much hair out the first time I used it.  and my dog didn't mind being brushed,1
"This product works! Be patient and consistent. It saved 2 of my puppies. Sadly it was too late to try it on the other 2 :(
Please buy it if you have a dog with Parvo. It will save them!",1
"Bought the bed and this cover.  Just washed it -- came out fine.  My 20# Westie and her two kittens love the bed which is soft and puffy!  Their favorite bed in the house.  (Yes, every room, good grief.)",1
"I measured my for before i bought this product.  The sizing was completely off from what the chart originally stated.  The medium I order should have been considered a small.  It was a really cute harness,  too bad I can't use it.  Returned.",0
"I bought this back in May 2013 and its still working just fine... almost. The legs that hold the wheels have come loose so it kind of sways around when I move it. Luckly I don't have to move it all that often so I don't have to deal with it, but I'm afraid the legs will snap if I move it too much... the cage is HUGE though. Have two Chinchillas in there and they run all over the place.",1
These stayed on reasonably well compared to others. The reason we had to return these is that they are just basically bags and so they slap together when our dog would try to walk and freak her out.,0
"My huskies and my fosters love these balls! The squeaker is concealed and last a long time. I posted a picture of my Mastiff foster, Bentley chewing on one so y'all can see what theses balls survive here... Haha
I buy these all the time.",1
"Bought this wheel directly from Exotic Nutrition. It was silent for about a month. Within 4 months it was horribly loud, and wobbly.  Only one chin was using it and it took him a couple of weeks to start using it. Contacted Exotic Nutrition for customer support. They were horrible! Rude, dismissive,  and condescending.  Will never buy anything from them again!",0
So you either need a young puppy or multiple dogs for this to run out before your companion does. Good product and will last you forever.,1
Very good basking lights. My bearded dragon loves it,1
Bought this in april. Motor stopped powering on in June. Now its just an expensive plastic tub. Self pickup was not as good as I had hoped. Would not buy again.,0
"I'll start this off by saying that I'm not a person who thought I would buy clothes for my dog. However, my dog doesn't tolerate cold weather and was even cold in the house so I had to do something. This sweater is great quality and she loves it! The length is a little long, but the girth fits well and there is enough room at the leg holes that it doesn't cause chaffing. Definitely be sure to wash this after you're sure it fits your dog (I hand washed mine, but the instructions do say it is machine washable); it will feel much softer and the dyes wash out. I've noticed the sweater stretches over time, but considering it is knit and my dog is squirmy and active, it's not surprising. I also bough the ""Ski Bum"" style and it's great too!",1
My cats just love it.  It went really fast.  I have a few cats that are what I would consider seafood afficianados and they even liked it.  (I foster cats and they are forever changing.),1
This product is good,1
"Bought this for my cockatiels. My youngest one really loves it, and perches in front of it and sings constantly.",1
the hit of the party!,1
"Used it fir weeks, didn't help at all",0
"My cat Trigger loves these things, we call them Trigger treats (like Scooby-snacks only cooler)",1
ONLY thing my finiciky cat will eat.,1
"This was a big disappointment. I thought I was purchasing a brown toy, but when it arrived, it was an ugly camo pattern. I now see that there is a disclaimer that says ""colors may vary"" but this was not clear when I purchased the item. Also, there is a warning on the packing that says that the toy is not supposed to be chewed. I will return the toy because it was annoying to receive something that my dog won't be able to really play with.",0
"Very nice item,good construction and easy to setup..I recomend this item",1
Our cats' favorite litter box. It's easy to clean and the steps help a little with litter tracking.,1
"I had ordered their older model and my Great Dane pup loved it. He isn't a ""power chewer"" but he definitely can chew the heck out of things. The first one began to show red after about 3 months so I researched and found this ""new and improved"" one. I hated the larger price tag but based on reviews I ordered it, that was on June 16th and a month later the end is nearly chewed though and completely unusable not to mention unsafe. My dog doesn't have free reign with the stick, he has supervised playtime with it as a reward. So this shouldn't have happened according to their own product description. My dog hasn't chewed through his KONG this fast! As far as their ""guarantee"" goes, I haven't had anyone contact be back and it isn't listed on Amazon as being guaranteed so I wouldn't bank on that happening either. Just not willing to throw away anymore money on a product that twice has not measured up to all the hype....",0
The clipper/charger have no charging indicator so you never know whether the unit is actually charging/charged or how much of a charge is left.,0
Does not fit the pump it was recommended as an additional purchase,0
I work in a pet supply store. Lots of people come in asking for fortiflora as they say it gets their pet to eat. So I tried some for my picky 19 year old cat even though I didn't like the ingredients. My cat hated it.,0
"very poorly made,, not sized right at all. Not worth the money",0
Durable even for the tough chewers. Keeps the dog entertained,1
My two boxers love these.  Don't know how well they clean their teeth exactly.  I use them as treats or rewards.,1
"Lousy food. It's all white corn and NOTHING much else. I switched to ""Premium"" and I cannot begin to tell you how great it is compared to this junk. Same company - two entirely different bird foods.",0
"The first week I had this it helped. I have 2 Yorkies and when they would bark and it would go off they would stop.  Second week they figured out if they barked in a lower,deeper voice it wouldn't go off. Third week it didn't help. When people would walk by my house my dogs would go off in a barking tirade and the thing would go off and they didn't pay it any attention.",0
"I was expecting a dog whistle.... Ya know high pitched that only the dog could hear, not this one it's a kids toy, yes the dog would stop and listen then ignore it. You can actually get the clicker and whistle cheaper at a pretty store",0
"I bought this for our puppy who is about 25 pounds. He is chewing everything because of his puppy teeth. It is HARD AS A ROCK. If you throw this hard enough it will hurt someone. We took this away from the puppy. There is no give to the chew toy at all, it is made of hard plastic.",0
"Work just fine. Fit well & stay put. Finally, inge ditched the aluminum foil!",1
Two weeks of use did nothing.,0
"The tree was very easy to assemble, and as soon as I put it together, my cat began playing with it, running up and down the posts, sleeping on the perches, jumping everywhere.  He absolutely adores it and plays on it constantly.

Unfortunately... it's not very sturdy.  Two months after buying it, one of the high posts split at the join with the platform.  They are a hard cardboard and plastic glued together, and my cat jumping from perch to perch caused it to break.  I contacted Majestic, and they were very polite and helpful, sending me a replacement part immediately.  I can't fault them on their customer service.

Now, five months after buying it, another of the high posts has broken in the exact same way, this time knocking over my television (not broken, luckily).  I'm not going to even bother contacting Majestic for a replacement, because it's obvious it's a problem in the design and material of the structure- it's just not made for a very playful, active cat.  My cat weighs about 10 pounds, so he's not especially heavy, and is the only one using it- and within a few months several pieces have been shown to be structurally unsound.  I've taken down the rest of the high perches because I don't want them breaking.

Maybe this is good for a calm, sedentary cat, but I don't think I'll be buying this brand again.

Also, it's killer to clean, dirt and hair stick to it strongly and vacuuming doesn't help much.",0
Pumps water as if were electric,1
Bought this filter to clean approximately 25 gallons and it stopped working in 12 hours.  The draw is horrible and it is very loud.  Save your money!!!!!,0
"Made the job of clipping my cats nails fast and easy which was good for her and for me too! Very good product, good quality, very glad that this is the one I chose.",1
"I made the mistake of buying this and threw it away after feeding one. This is cooked/roasted chicken feet and that was written in FINE print, which is FALSE ADVERTISING. When bones are cooked, especially chickens', they splinter and can cause damage in a dog's intestines and esophagus. In bad cases, can also kill your dog or cat. I feel that it is my responsibility to share this information.

DO NOT BUY COOKED BONES. Poultry feet are a great chewThe best way to feed is to buy dehydrated or freeze-dried raw, or even frozen feet. Always monitor your dog when chewing.",0
very good,1
"I followed the directions exactly and for some reason, even after a few weeks, it's just like brown-ish green blades of glass here and there. I know I don't have a green thumb, but it's cat grass in a box... I expected it to be easier :/",0
"I wear these socks for the gym and whenever I play flag football... I normally wear compression socks to relieve soreness and leg cramps I get here and there... the only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is that this socks aren't as tight as my other compression socks... just a small complaint... otherwise, these are great...",1
This thing was so small I gave it my friend fo rher cat!  Not worth the price of returning it,0
I trust this harness for my MinPin who loves to go on walks and ruins with me. She has a pink one as well. These seem to be the most comfortable harnesses for her. They don't leave marks and she doesn't try to take them off. I also like that they cover her chest and keep her secure. They are also pretty stylish.,1
It looks nice but the bunny didn't like it.  It's very dark and they usually spend time in a protected area.  I put him in once when he was 8 wks old and he was afraid to go up the stairs (it's pretty steep).  When I put him in the top he hid in the darkest part.  He wasn't happy.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It's never been used but that one time.  I wasted my money.,0
"I read the reviews prior to purchase and hoped that this toy would be durable enough for my American bulldog/pit mix to play with. Unfortunately, the toy was in pieces in a matter of minutes. The tail was the first to get chewed off, then the feet, finally the eyes.
I ordered a medium for my lab puppy and it was the same size as the large toy even though the large toy cost more.
If you have a powerful dog that likes to chew and ""kill"" toys, this will not last.",0
my poor 4 Chihuahuas I put this on them from shoulder blade down the spine to the tail and I notice by 2 hours after putting it on them they was loaded with fleas I mean loaded before i put it on them you would see a few fleas on them but after putting it on from head to tail was loaded and now after a few weeks they are losing hair and scratching a whole lot more then before using this,0
They get the job done and serve their purpose well. I love that they come with the cute bone carrying case! Very thick and durable. Recieved at discount for honest reciew,1
"Fits perfect, but slides a little bit with weight of GoPro on it.",1
As described,1
"My boyfriend and I purchased one of these last year in March. We had just adopted a Rottie mix from the shelter and wanted something sturdy so he didn't destroy our home. We purchased the 36"" version and were overall pretty satisfied. The box was dinged up a bit and one of the latches is a little bit tough to close, but that was great for us because it kept Wrex in! Anyway, we have had this crate for a year now and it is still in perfect condition. It must be pretty strong because it has held up against a VERY heavy chewer. He can tear apart a Kong toy in 2 minutes flat. A few reviews stated that there were sharp edges, but we have had no problems with this. We are considering purchasing a larger size because our ""little"" 80lb baby just doesn't fit the 36 anymore. If you're looking for a well priced, relatively durable crate, this is it.",1
"Haven't used yet, but it appears very well made.",1
"My cat loves this variety pack.  I was very disappointed, however, to see it was no longer on the ""Prime"" listing!  Please fix this!",1
"I had to make multiple cuts with some scissors to prevent it from slipping off my puppy. Unless you are a tailor, I would not recommend.",0
Very thick and sturdy dog flap.  Wish it was cheaper but is quality made.,1
"Every cat I've ever met loves Temptations. Even cats that generally dislike other cat treats.

They don't prefer one flavor over the other so pretty much whichever one I pick is okay. (Though I did mix a bunch of different flavors together once and they refused to eat them.)

This tub was a few cents cheaper than it was in stores.",1
"Worked on my one year old terrier/chi mix... I re-applied it the next day, no more chewing!",1
"I was looking for a replacement collar for one a friend had given me but had deteriorated over the years and this one was adorable. However, head the warnings in the reviews, it's a total piece of junk! Within moments of going on my cat, the jewels were already falling out (without even being scratched by her foot, etc) leaving behind SHARP metal settings. I quickly became afraid that the metal would scratch her or get her stuck on something and threw it in the garbage. NOT WORTH IT. I found a much higher quality collar for $1 at the dollar store, go figure.",0
The bells are too long and my dog tried to bite off! I can not use,0
"My kitty licks her plate so clean, it looks like I just washed it, she really loves it. She leaves leftovers with other brands of wet food.",1
fit right over my existing foam pad,1
"My dog will NOT eat them. Even disguised in meat. The other ones I bought which were smaller and soft she would, but these giant wafers have been just sitting here going to waste.",0
Did not fit  dog size was way to small,0
"Only lights half way around the neck
Would advise to try to find a collar with LEDs that go all the way around",0
"Still going strong three years later, and I have a hard core chewer!!  Best dog toy ever!",1
"Quite simply, my guys love this stuff. I opened a bag of what is their favorite cat treats. They turned up their noses at the treats, preferring the Hill's Youthful Vitality. I've always trusted Science Diet to provide my fur babies with the best nutrition possible. Since I began using Science Diet all of my cats have needed fewer vet visits & with the exception of one that escaped & was hit by a car all my have lived to between 18 & 21 years. This includes the ones that were already 10 years old when I switched to Science Diet. The particular variety is intended for cats 7 & older.  I highly recommend this and all Science Diet cat food varieties to give you the highest quality food for the furry members of your family",1
"The size listed is for the outside diameter, not the inner diameter. Actual ID is 1/8th of an inch.",0
I cannot get these in the store and they are my dog's favorite treat!,0
Made in China do not subject your pet to poison,0
"These leak.  Plain and simple.  The ""lining"" is one sheet of plastic on the bottom and does not extend up the sides so the urine leaks over the edges and soaks the bottom of the cardboard.  I was mopping up urine from underneath every time I changed the box.  I had to put a plastic garbage bag underneath and then I wondered why I was bothering.  I bought a ""permanent"" hard plastic pan and voila!  no more problems.  Plus, this is like the coffee maker pods filling up the landfills, on crack.  Talk about a monstrous waste of landfill space.",0
Didn't grab any of my beagle's hair off a faux leather couch. May be it would work on other materials?,0

"This harness is well constructed and user friendly. Once your dog becomes accustomed to the step in aspect of the harness,it is  a nice harness.",1
our dog loves it - he won't eat anything else!,1
dogs love these,1
"The light on this isn't that bright, you can plug a usb cord into it to power it instead of batteries which is nice.  It took a gallon jug of water to fill it!",1
I'm a little bit of what they call a Hippie.  I buy organic everything.  I stumbled accross this little product,1
This costume is so stinkin cute we love it! Our dog is 16 pounds and we got the Medium which fit perfectly.,1
I purchased the largest size I could and it is too tight.  The glove material needs to be more stretchy.,0
"I got the medium sized chocolate colored bed. It looks just like the photo. It is very soft, and our 5 lb chihuahua loves it! He loves laying on our plush blankets so I knew he would like this bed. It has decent support for my very small 5 lb dog, but it could use a bit more fluff. There is no padding underneath the removable pillow, which is why it lacks support. I would recommend the medium size bed only for dogs under 15 lbs.",1
I have a 6lb chihuahua that needs to slow down eating. Thought this would help but she just pushes it with her nose and the suctioncup gives way and there it is on the floor when i come back after they have eaten. Would not buy again.,0
Very fluffy and comfortable. My dog drags it around the house.,1
This has been working great for the dog and we've only been using the beep and vibrate. He goes bonkers during vibrate and stops what he's doing immediately.,1
"I like the look, and it seems sturdy enough, but the faux fleece covering has a large hole in it on the privacy cube. I'm certain the kitty we're getting will enlarge this hole in short order. I will need to buy patch material to fix this flaw that should have been noticed before this item was ever packaged for sale. The hassle of repacking and returning this large item for exchange, when I could be getting another one with a similar problem and further hassle, isn't worth my time.",0
Really good product and fast delivery! Works really well for my pup (well...my 120 pound moose of a dog). Helps keep all the hair and sand off my seats. Fits well in the back of my SUV and is easy to clean!,1
"We bought 2 of these. They helped greatly reduce annoying barking from our dogs (ie. squirrel in the tree.) However, after 2-3 months they began not working. We have replaced batteries & made sure they are full. They will work briefly and then begin not working again. So I am just not sure about the quality. Good Luck!",0
"I was very happy to receive the new collar for my Poodle.  He is a Fashionisto.
Shoes, Clothes, Hats, Collars and Leashes.",1
Omg I love this little thing!!! Most of our dogs love it too! ,1
Pay attention to the size of this thing. If you have a tiny dog then this may be wonderful but it's only like 2-3 inches big so for my 30 pound dog this wasn't worth anything.,0
Fits perfectly!,1
My chi loves this with a little canned wet dog food.  I tried the other Ultra toy breed grain and she did not like as much.  This much have better flavor.......,1
As advertised. Long lasting. Very effective.,1
Great for hiding meds in difficult to pill cats,1
"These Lupine step in harnesses are THE BEST I have ever used.  I have 5 dogs, different sizes and breeds ranging from large to small and I love these!  They are made of very durable material and come in  a variety of colors.  The adjustable straps make it very easy to fit any dog.",1
"Works perfectly!  My dog rings the bell instead of scratching up the door.  The sound is loud enough to hear, but also not annoying.",1
great clipper worked great.  make sure the dog is completely washed before using.  if not it would not work,1
"Was missing some of the screws. Amazon replace the entire unit and when the second unit came, it too was missing some of the screws. Luckily between the first and the second unit we were able to finally put it together. If it was not missing screws it would be a great purchase.",0
True reflection of information,1
We have 3 dogs who all live to chew.  Each sniffed it and walked on.  We do not buy rawhide or products not made in the US. This is made here but none of my dogs will touch it.,0
poor design on the  door .food cup doors and access door worked against each other every time you opened one or the other. not a good fit for me and my bird. will keep looking,0
I love this mat. Its large enough. The litter box is on top of it so that the litter falls to the mat and not the floor. Easy to vacuum.,1
"My dog's stomach issues seem to be a bit better since he started taking the probiotics. Having the added bonus of joint health is a big plus, too. I'll definitely reorder.",1
works as it should,1
only for small dog puppies. its ridiculously small!,0
"Great deal, my goldens love them. I have found that they last longer than other brands I have bought. Yes they are smelly but what hooves don't smell! Would recommend this product to anyone who has dogs that like to chew. Very satisfied and will definitely purchase again!!",1
My chinchilla won't go near these.,0
"I bought this pet carrier to carry my 8lb cat with me on the plane. My cat was very comfortable in the carrier and it definitely helped to get her used to it before flying. I bought the small carrier first but it was not big enough to fit my cat...she was very squished, so I had to buy the large version. If your animal is 7lbs or heavier, I would suggest getting the large carrier, so that it can grow into it.",1
I buy these for my guinea pig and they are awesome! She loves them and is practically yanking them out of my hand to get them!,1
"I had the opposite problem as the other reviewer--on my (small for her breed) Newfoundland, the skunk tail started about her waist!! I added 1' worth of black material and stapled velcro to keep the tail around hers, but it was ridiculous.  Way too small.  Adorable though!  So hard to find outfits large enough for Giant breeds.",0
"I really, really like these cages. There are some wonderful things about it and the one thing that isn't wonderful should be changed. The fact that you cannot pull out a tray to clean the cage is just wrong! I have 3 English budgies and I am a woman and my late 60's (shhhh!).  The cage is easy to put together, they come in a variety of sizes for whatever your needs, the clear plastic around the bottom is awesome to keep the seed inside the cage and I really like the end seed and water dishes. They come with a little cover over them so that the birds can't poop in their food. Now for the bad, the fact that I have to lift the top of the cage up and put it on the floor to clean the bottom is really awkward. As you can see, it hasn't been a deal-breaker because I like everything else about the cage except for that. I've had shoulder surgeries and this is really hard. I know some other women who are a tad older and they just can't reach around to pick up the cage and put it down; it's very awkward for them.
And now I'm going to give you guys one of the best hands ever! Never use paper to line The Birdcage again. I went to that famous, huge Swedish store and bought a roll of their clear shelf liner. I put the bottom grate on top of the shelf liner and drew around it to cut a perfectly sized liner for the cage. I put the liner in the bottom, put the grate on top and then the cage on top of that of course. When it's time to change it, you just vacuum it up and then rinse it off under hot tap water dry it with a paper towel and you are done in under 5 minutes. It's awesome! Since I have three birds and three cages this has been a lifesaver and a time saver. Give it a try!",1
"I bought my Buttercombs and the handle for my new pups and my persian cat. I wanted so bad to love this handle, but it made it much harder to use the wonderful comb!  I felt it took a LOT of control away from me.  I was working with smaller animals, so that may have been a factor as well.

I am glad others are having better luck with it than I did...I wish it would have worked for me.",0
I needed caps for my CritterTrail to close off tunnels.  I wasn't able to find them in stores near me so ended up ordering them online.  They came in a pack of two.  They worked perfectly and are a good quality.,1
My dog had this tore up in a matter of one day. Not sturdy enough. May be good for toy type dogs.,0
"my dog love these treats and so thrifty, the quality is great and I would highly recommend these treats to all my friends.",1
"It's hay, expensive hay in a plastic bag I spent on this bag what I would spend on a whole bail of hay. Inflation and convenience fee I guess",0
Love this collar,1
"Cats love it.  We mix it with their wet food or they will lick it off our fingers.  Our vet recommended we give our new kittens L-Lysine.  The kittens (littermates) were initially FIV positive.  One still is, the other is not...we have hopes that the positive test will turn negative as she matures and passes out maternal antibodies (as of this writing, they are 6.5 months old).  They've been getting L-Lysine pretty much daily since we brought them home.  No major health issues.  Strong and vibrant kitties.  Is it the Lysine?  Maybe...maybe the rest of their diet.  Maybe the vigor of youth.",1
never holds a charge,0
It was cute but frankly it was of substandard quality. The seems of the hammock deteriated with ferret use use within two days. So...I won't be purchasing more from this vendor.,0
"I really like this set.  However, the handle broke off the top one almost immediately.  I like that it is two containers.  I also love that its on wheels.  Other than the handle broke off it is very strong.  My 7 year old climes on it a lot and it hasn't cracked and the wheels work great.",1
"My 10 lb Havanese received this Gingie as a Christmas gift.  Within 3 days, the seam on the head came apart.  My Havanese is a small dog, but was able to damage this toy quickly.  I'm sure it would not have held up more than 1 day with a bigger dog.  I wouldn't recommend this product unless you are in to hand stitching ripped seams.",0
The dog loves them so that means I love them. Durable and they bounce. Just what my dog needs.,1
My dog ate this inside of one day and I had to throw it away.,0
"In response to the other review for this product, the one star rating is not a true rating.  The reviewer failed to notice this was DOG food- so she rated her experience not the product. It mixes well with dry food, my Cairn Terriers love it!",1
My dogs love these!,1

"Bubba's Super Steamer Carpet Cleaner is the best pet odor remover/carpet cleaner I have tried. We have two dogs in our home. When our female came into season our male lost his mind and marked all over the house. There was one area in particular that I was worried we would need to remove the carpet. It was right in front of our sofa, not that meant replacing the flooring in the whole room. I tired several other cleaners and odor neutralizers not no avail. I poured about a gallon of water mixed with cleaner on the floor and let it sit over night. The next morning I used my shop vac to get up all the water then when over the area with my steam cleaner and viola the odor was gone.
Two months ur female had litter of 5 pups that stayed in my daughter's bedroom until they went to new homes.  After they left we cleaned the carpet according to the directions and all the little puppy traces were gone. She actually wants to have another liter next year. (ummm maybe)
 I love that one ounce is all that is needed per gallon of water, and that it has a clean almost minty fragrance, not a strong chemical odor like some cleaners. I will always keep a bottle of Bubba's super steamer carpet cleaner under my sofa.",1
Excellent product!,1
"Loud.  Really loud.  Broke after 6 months.  Hydor said I could return it to them, and they'd see if it was a fuse (in a 3v dc product? Ha ha ha), and fix it or replace it.  Fine, but I'm not spending 5 bucks to return a $20 item that I didn't like in the first place.  I bought an Eheim to replace it and am glad the Hydor broke.",0
"I love the design of this step in hardness, the old over the head harness was difficult to put on my dog. The reflective stitching is well done. I would buy another if needed. I purchased the small to medium harness for my Rat Terrier, who has a 21 inch chest, it fit perfectly with a little adjusting. I think you could go up to 24"" chest.",1
Perfect for all furniture types. This moved the hair into a single pile for easy disposal.,1
"I have one cat that even though the cat-nip may be in a large jar he still tries to get to it, putting the jar about like a golf ball if I forget to put it in the cupboard.
They all love this Cosmic Catnip. I and my daughter have gotten catnip sometimes that just don't seem to have any 'nip' to it.
One can tell a good quality cat-nip by the cats nusseling, eating, and rolling, antics. My cats have all the signs.",1
"This is a great dual leash. I have my golden retriever & lab using it since Jan. 2012. Just today, a clasp broke and I had to rig it with a carabiner to attach my dog to the leash. The leash itself is thick for my two dogs (92 lbs & 88 lbs). There is NO fraying at all. The handle is nice for me to hold onto than other leashes I have too. I would definitely buy another if I needed to, but being frivolous, I will use the carabiner for now.",1
I bought these in a large for my 61lb goldendoodle and they work really well. They aren't too stiff and clunky. She could easily walk and run around in them and didn't seem to mind them being on. They were also fairly easy to put on. The 2 on her back feet did twist to the side but I think that was because I didn't have the strap tight enough.,1
"One cat loved it, the other barfs it up all the time.  No good for my babies.",0

"I was very excited to give my very small (4.9 lb) half-Maltese-half-Yorkie this toy, because I'm always looking for ways to keep his tiny high-energy self busy and entertained.

First the pro -- it's a great idea! He loved trying to work out how to get toys out of the box. This could have been one of the best purchases I've ever bought him.

Next the cons -- Our tiny little guy is not a big toy destroyer. He is about to be a year old, and in the 9 months we have had him, only one of his toys has ""bitten the dust"" -- it was his favorite, and it did dutiful service for about 8 months of constant chewing and games of tug and was buried with honors -- and  quickly replaced! (For those looking for a great toy, it's the ""Petstages Just For Fun No Stuffing Plush LiL Squeak"".)

But he had managed to rip open one of those balls the very first time I introduced them to him -- not a good start! All the balls ended up coming un-stitched, and the inner stuffing was not stuff you want your dog to swallow -- indeed, I got to clean up the vomit when he did so.

I ended up taking some of his other toys and putting them in the box. That was great, because they were different textures, and even more fun for him to get out than the balls themselves!

But then the box itself. That item is simply not made to be chewed in the slightest. And I don't care that a human might be aware that the toys are IN the box -- when you give your dog a toy, he is going to want to chew all of it, and thus any of it should be safe to chew and strong enough to stand up to said chewing. This he pretty well shredded, and he hasn't actually shredded any other toys with his tiny little teeth before!

I'd love to see this great concept become a really high-quality, safe toy for dogs. But it's not there, yet!",0
"We foolishly kept trying over a period of a few weeks - programming/reprogramming - occasionally it worked, more often it didn't. We should have processed a return request as soon as we felt like this was an unreliable product.  We're out $35 dollars. You might want to think twice.",0
"This product actually worked as advertised on a traumatized cat I am fostering.  She calmed down and started eating again within 24 hours of plugging the diffuser in.  So that is excellent.  But the downside for me was that the bottle leaked the oily liquid onto the floor (thank goodness it was laminate and not carpet).  I cleaned it up, but the next few nights it did it again.  On the fourth night the room STUNK with a petroleum-type odor and an almost-burning smell.  I thought it had caught on fire.  I unplugged it and will not use it again.  I hope I will be able to rid of this smell. At least the cat is calm now.",0

"For the price it's a decent set but I have only tried 5 total and so far 2 of them had broken seals so they didn't bubble right they just had huge air pockets released at the seal. Other than that they work perfect, and on the seals I'm just going to try to use hot glue and I'm betting that will fix it so it's a good buy.",1
"After his sisters got bunkbeds for their dolls, my 6-year old son wanted a dog house for his stuffed dogs. This is just the right size for about 3 stuffed animals to sleep next to his bed. Seems pretty sturdy, and the pillow insert is removable in case we ever need to clean it.",1
Dog loves these...,1
Much too large.,0
"Not pleased.  My cats were, but I wasn't.  This wasn't packed well and something inside the box crushed my Temptations box and the treats were all through the box.  Luckily it's a nice day and I could sneak outside away from the sharks uh I mean cats to take care of the problem without losing any limbs.  They do like their treats.",0

Please if you love your pet don't feed these to them. My dog had been eating these since he was able to. I found little worms in there. I'm also in per suite of getting these off the shelves. There not safe at all. If one animal is harmed by this product. I don't care how many fives stars people give this. Know what you are feeding your pets,0
"I have two 13 lbs yorkies and they love it. One of my dog is an aggressive chewer so toys do not last long in our household. With this toy, we did end up taking the stuffing out of the gator's head, but the rest of the is still in tact. Will purchase again if they ever ruin it.",1
Excellent Seller! Will Highly Recommend Them! Thank you!,1
My rat ate through it very quickly.........,0
I could not find a container like this anywhere for my dog's food (live in Hawaii where we have no PetCo or Petsmart) and for the price w/free shipping from Amazon this was a steal.  My dog's food stays fresh and it is easy to move and refill with it's large lid and wheels.  This container will hold a 50lb bag of dog food with room to spare.,1
"Bag came with a little hole at the bottom, where powder from the food made a little of a mess, but nothing a little tape didn't fix!",1

"The perch was packaged poorly and arrived broken.  I fixed it (sort of) and put in my bird's cage.  The attachment to the cage is flimsy, it wouldn't be suitable for anything bigger than a Cockatiel.  The perch is also not real wood, which is a major disappointment.",0
cool,1
Works great,1
"My cats (I have 5) love catnip. I mean they REALLY Really Love the stuff. At first they liked the compressed ball but the interaction only lasted a short while. They rolled on it, licked it and batted it around. But the novelty wore off after about 1/2 hour. Now they walk by it and are completely uninterested. I don't know if it is too much of a good thing or the catnip is poor quality or only fresh on the outside of the ball or what. But they have no interest in the ball anymore, but are still reacting to loose catnip -so I don't think that they lost that drive.
So-good idea for a product but my catnippers are unimpressed.",0
Simply does not work for my frenchies. They didn't bark the first fay but now just ignores it. Must be not working. I still kept it thinking it might work the next day but nope. Should have returned them.,0
Very happy with this purchase.,1
BARELY HOLDS 2 QUARTS!!,0
Bought this for my American bulldog puppy. Used the divided when he was smaller. I think this is a great crate. He's never tried to escape because he's been in it since he was 8 weeks old. Now we leave the door open and he goes in by himself to sleep sometimes. He's 91 lbs and has plenty of room!  Tray is super easy to pull Out and clean.  Plan on using this until he can be trusted to roam the house when we are gone!!!,1
It doesn't work. I bought it to deter my neighbor's dog when approaching me. The dog stopped for a second but continued toward me with a curious look. I tried again with other dogs on the beach. They got the same reaction. I am returning it,0

"Purchased 2 of these mats 8 months ago. Initially I loved them. Now, not so much. They ARE soft and they ARE cute.
First issue: the smooth area around the paw pad and between the toes is VERY thin and tore right away.
Next issue: they do a great job catching litter, however...if there is any kind of an ""accident"" that sprays outside the box onto the mat, cleaning this thing is a nightmare. Easy to vacuum when it's dry litter, but if there is any dampness whatsoever, hosing this thing off in the shower is impossible without gummy, gunky litter stuck in the soft plastic loops of the mat.
If you have senior cats that sometimes don't ""keep it in the box"", this is not the answer. Trust me.
I am going to replace both of these mats with something that has sides and a smoother, easy-to-rinse surface.",0
"We got this to add to uor extensive collection of tubes and housing for our beloved ""Fergie"".  She loved this turn-about too much.  She made house in it and it does not come apart easily (to say the least)  There is an opening for the middle section but very hard to open the tubes in order to clean them.  Because of the difficulty to clean, it had to go.",0
Way over priced.  Smells funky too.  Doesn't seem to make a difference in getting the tangles out.  I am quite disappointed.,0

Been using a HO T5 fluorescent for several years. Have co2 injection and very little if any pearling previous to purchasing this LED. Now all plants are bubbling. Have had it installed for 3 days.  This light looks to be allowing the plants to take better advantage of the co2 than the fluorescent. Kids love the storm functions.,1
My dog really loved them! It's difficult to find dog food containing venison. I hope to treat him again soon.,1
"Even though this is the better of the three systems on Amazon, it still needs many alterations. It doesn't fit all toilet shapes; needs to be deeper for when the cat kicks up the litter; holes to let pee flow through; and more rings with smaller oval holes sizes (because cats don't like the large hole on the orange ring right away).

All this information is posted on the company's blog yet the company has done nothing about it for many years now. It's up to you if you want to give your money to a lazy company. Also the DVD is outdated and not very useful.

Buyers/trainers be warned: this process is very messy and takes many months to train the cat. It is also very difficult with two or more cats because once it is dirty it has to cleaned right away or the other cat(s) don't use it unless there is lots of fushable litter. Different cats learn at different speeds and you can only go at the slowest paced cat so you need patience!",0
"My cat ate less than a quarter cup of this and decided he disliked it. Now, he turns his nose up at it when I grab the bag.
Years ago pet food companies used to manufacture cat food in boxes that were either 8 oz. or 16 oz., possibly both; it's been so long since I've seen them I don't remember, but playing hit or miss with these huge bags all the time is just wasteful.  It's disgusting.

I should probably take the hints my cat is giving me and give him a homemade diet, there isn't much in these commercial pet foods that are good for him anyway.",0
"Solid product. Sharp blades, works well. Good quality",1
"This stuff is way too toxic. We bought this product in hopes of killing off the ear mites, however there are 2 things wrong with this stuff. Firstly, the bottle comes wth no directions, whatsoever. None. Not on the bottle, no leaflet inside..nothing. So I found some kind of direction by using google for similar products. Then after only 2 applications of a couple tiny droplets (we have a Cornish Rex..they are very tiny, so we used less then what was recommended on the internet)...our cat just started losing all of the fur around his ears and top of head. And no, it was not from her scratching it, because she is older and can not reach. It just fell out, I believe due to the toxic nature of this product.
 We have obviously discontinued use and are currently just using olive oil and yellow dock, which is going over much better. I do not reccommend this product at all.",0
My cabin in Maine was overrun with mice this summer.  Bought these because they look like they mean business!  They proved worthless--merely feeding stations for the mice!  I caught nary a mouse.  Went back to the traditional wooden mousetraps that cost 4 for $1.20!  Caught 41 mice and counting.  Can I give this product a negative 5 stars?,0
"I initially was attracted to the product because it was waterproof. I like the 3 types of settings: sound, vibrate, and shock--with 7 levels of intensity.  Plus the fact that the walkie talkie device can manage up to 3 dogs, which in my case, is not necessary. My  one year and three month old female golden retreiver molli, has an abundance of energy and likes to jump, play rough, and nip at my 11 and 9 year old. I must say though, that they ""get her going"" so to speak. Molli does NOT need any encouragement. At any rate, I have ONLY had to use the ""shock"" mode 2X. After about 3-4 days, after using the ""sound"" mode extensively, ALL I need to do now to get Molli to respond and behave, is to just ""pick up"" the walkie talkie device and talk to her, and she immediately ""stops"" the unwanted behavior. Molli is a very ""smart"" dog, and this device is absolutely wonderful. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.",1
My pet loves these crunchy treats. Can't purchase these locally and were comparable in price when I could. My pet is happy too!,1
"I purchased these at Petsmart for around the same price as Amazon.  Quality is not up to par with what I had previously purchased.  Another annoying facet with this product is the glue to does not dispense from the tube so I had to apply it manually  and this resulted in a mess.  This may just be an anomaly with the product, either way, I'm going to have to take back the remaining caps.  Don't waste your money there are better caps on the market.",0

"Can't find this in the larger tub size anymore, so opted for this size. My dog likes the small size (he's a more bites are more important than bite size.) He loves all of the flavors.

"I'm using this playpen for my dog and her puppies! They are now 2 weeks old this is the perfect way to keep newborns from separating mom can come in and out the door but her pups are always together! These are a must have for any breeder of small breed dogs much better than the typical kiddie pool many people use. The bottom is great because even if mommy pup moves all the blankets the pups can still grab on to crawl instead of slipping very important for growing hips!
It is easy to wash as well just wipe it with diluted 50/50 vinegar and water cleans up nice!

 I was fortunate to receive this playpen at a discounted price during a special promotion to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
The discount has not influenced or impacted my judgement of this product. I take this seriously and include my own opinion and experience with each product I review.

"I've had tanks all of my life.  I have a lot filters, and have used a lot of filters.  I often have extra filters hanging around that I found at yard sales, I've really only had a couple of filters stop working, usually, I sell a tank and some filters go with it and that is how filters leave my life.  So I bought a nano tank, loved it, thougth this filter was nice, liked the spray bar.  Initially, the flow seemed a bit much and the fish had too much current.  I adjusted the bar so there would be less current and it worked fine.  Then it began to hum and make noise, but I just lived with it.  Then the top spray bar started falling off, closer inspection and I realized that the plastic had somehow broke.  Today I noticed my fish at the top of the tank, which means lack of oxygen, I have a bunch of plants and the light had just come on, so probably a bunch of CO2 from the plants during the night.  Checked the filter, not working at all.  Messed with it, messed with it,  no water is being pumped although the impeller is turning, and it is sooo noisy.  Am throwing this filter in the trash today, will put a different filter on it, one of my yard sale external ones.  This is really a piece of junk.  A bit over a year, never worked great and now doesn't work at all.  Too bad, I use to respect Fluval, I'll avoid it now.",0
Super warm!  My Boston terrier (4 mnths/10lbs) loves it too!  Fits him perfect and it doesnt get in the way of going potty.,1
It's the right size and sort of soft. Very thin!! I will put a towel underneath to give my dogs more comfort.,0
Bird likes these.,1
This product caused my dog to go to vet because a tiny piece of plastic got stuck under his gums. Very costly.,0
I have had this for a long time and it has never filtered out the small stuff!  replaced it with a sand filter.  After a water change the pond would be dirty in a week!,0
The black collar only worked if it was fully charged and next to the dog. I did like the vibration instead of having to shock. Wish it would have worked.,0

"Tried to use this in Florida when our neighbors' ratty outdoor cats gave our dogs fleas but it didn't do anything but cost me money.

"We got this crate for our new puppy.  I love that it has 2 doors, giving you flexibility in how you place the crate.  And, with the life stages divider, we'll be able to use it as she continues to grow.  Very well made and reasonably priced.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there are some areas (like the bottom where the door meets) where the posts are sharp enough to pinch or scratch.  Got my hand as I was putting the puppy in.",1
Useless and my cat threw up afterwards,0
"This cat door was supposed to be brand new; however it had writting in manual, missing hardware, and does not work properly;  the electronic microchip pet collars do not activate the door unless you are almost touching the door (and yes I installed new energizer batteies); my cat doesnt know how to push the micro chip against the door to get it to open and couln't even if she wanted.  Anyhow it functions as a very expesive normal flap pet door that you can unlock and lock electronically.  I think this seller either didn't evaluate this product or is being shady.

I thought I'd give this Calm a try now that her allergies are in remission. After the first bath she broke out in red bumps on her chest and back. We went to her dermatologist & after a cytology, the bumps showed a ton of bacteria. Had to go back on topical steroids. Everything is now fine after 4 days of meds & daily Chlorhexidine baths. Will only use the Chlorhexidine from now on. The DR was surprised at the reaction she had. I guess like people they can have a reaction to anything.",0

I am so glad I purchased it, and my dog is glad also!!!",1
"This food had some good reviews on a site that rated the quality of various dog foods, however my yorkie puppy would not eat it.  He put a piece in his mouth and promptly spit it out.  He tried a couple of more pieces with the same result.  The kibble is larger in size than I had expected, about 3x larger than Royal Canin mini puppy 33,  and it smells nasty.  I did not like the smell at all and the puppy agreed.  Glad I only bought the trial size.",0
"I purchased one of these a while back. I liked it so much that now every one of my fish tanks has one on it. It makes keeping track of tank maintenance so simple. When you see it flash red, you can check the display and it will show you whether it's time for a water change, filter maintenance or a system check. The water change lets you set intervals in weeks while the filter maintenance and system check are in months. It'd be nice to have the filter maintenance in weeks also, but I can work with how it's set up now.

As far as some people claiming it being inaccurate, I have not had a single problem with any of mine so far. I have a very accurate TDS/Temp probe and all my thermometers are very close to the temp it shows. My only guess for others is that their thermometers are in different places from each other (ie, near the surface of the water or closer to the heater). The great thing about this unit is the long wired probe that you can place anywhere within your tank. I generally put mine centered and at the bottom back of the tank (and away from any heaters).

I do have to note that this unit potentially saved some of my fish. I had a heater break and stick on heat. The temperature in the tank started getting pretty high, and I noticed the temperature climb very quickly thanks to the audible alarm that sounds when the temperature gets out of the range you set (it also works if the temp gets too low. You get to set the low and high temp ranges). It's hard to say if I would've noticed the temp climb soon enough without it, but it for sure made me notice much quicker.",1

"Great dog training collar.  The battery lasts a long time, and it works flawlessly.  My dog caught on very quickly, and he never yelped as if he was in pain.  My dog stopped barking in less than two days.",1
The collar has made a dramatic impact in the behavior of my two dogs. Works wonderfully and is very effective. I would recommend this product to anyone with multiple dogs as an excellent training technique.,1
Look funny in dogs mouth.  Great ball for wet grass.,1
Works great on ticks but it is horrible on killing fleas. My Maltese dog is covered in flea dirt and fleas. I have never seen a flea product perform so poorly. Can 't wait to try something else next month.,0

My grey devoured them!,1
have had2 eggs now for over 6 months and they will not activate--I live in the country and have wi-fi --but neither device will activate--would not recommend to any oneness assured device will activate--great idea if it would work,0
The product came in dirty and has a distinct odor about it. The plastic suction cups for oily and dirty like they've been used for dipped in something. I would never suggest that for anyone to use on their animal. I did not get returned information from the vendor so I threw it away.,0
SMELLS GREAT,1
"I purchased this for the ""support"" but was not as advertised.  The material slips off the leg, offering little to no support.",0
This works better than plain baking soda--in a very smelly place,1
"Doesn't open when expected. I set it for 6 hours and it has a mind of it's own. It will go off in maybe 6, maybe 6 hrs 15 min. or sometimes 6 1/2 hours. This is unacceptable do to the fact my cat gets sick if not feed within a 6 hour increment. I also feel that to take the thing apart to add food and ice packs was alittle difficult. I believe the plastic clips would break after several times of prying this thing apart. Very disappointed in this design flaw and also with non-gel packs. Just using water they don't stay cold long enough, even for the 6 hour feeding.
Great concept for a auto feeder though, wish they would fix some flaws because I really liked this feeder over the others.
However, for cost purposes I would not recommend this item for anyone feeding there cats soft cat food.",0
"After reading several satisfactory reviews on Amazon, I purchased the Zuke's Turkey and Taterz mini bakes.  My two dogs are not picky eaters and especially love turkey and potatoes.  My miniature poodle absolutely refused them.  My terrier took them in his mouth and immediately spit them out.  I have tried several times, but the result is the same.  Since the ingredients are all natural, I took a small nibble myself to see why.  They taste terrible and the texture is awful.  This was a waste of money.",0

"It didn't take long for our cat to destroy this tower.  Poorly constructed with the ends of the tower tubes pulling free from the tubes, thus we had to remove the top tier as it became very unsteady.  Then the scratch posts began to unravel.  There are better products out there so we went to a local pet store and found a much better one which was less expensive.  It  may be fine for a couple of kittens, but not for an adult cat.",0
"Got this seat cover to protect my car from my new chocolate lab puppy!  I'll be picking her up right after the New Year, so haven't actually used it yet, but the quality is excellent and the material seems very durable. The extra belts are a bonus!",1
great product and got at a great price. works excellent.,1
Was ok for the first few days and then while my dog was wearing it outside. She started making this horrible sound like she was in pain. The collar was continually zapping her and she was in severe pain. When I got to her the collar was making a humming noise and was malfunctioning. I will never use it again.,0
Nice product worth buying,1
"Not sturdy. I had to reinforce it. I haven't had it long and my cats have already scratched holes in it. It's a cool design, but I will gladly buy one that has carpet instead of fabric. Learned my lesson.",0

"This was the only reasonably priced crate I could find for my great dane. The size is perfect, and the fact that it just folds up and needs no assembly is fantastic. It is fairly easy to transport because of this.  Gripes: the metal is not that strong, I broke the bottom latch on one of the doors trying to open the crate door.  Overall, it serves it's purpose for the money.",1
This was suggested by a veterinarian due to my dog starting to act very disoriented. After about a week she is back to her old self. Some dogs will take it right down I have to hide hers in peanut butter. What ever is in these things it works so give your dog a chance.,1
"Pretty good product. It definitely captures some, but not all, of the litter the cats track. It's a good size and nice design. The price might be a little high. Also my cats were initially afraid to touch it but they have managed to overcome their fear and they now cross it freely.",1
"I have large macaws.  These are very durable and stand up to their ""abuse"".  However, I am dismayed that the description is not quite accurate.  The three that I just received are not even 14"" long.  The description reads 14"" to 16"".  The diameter is also just 2"" at the base and less towards the ends.  The description reads 2"" to 3 1/2"".  How does one get a 16"" long 3"" wide perch?",1
Our puppies love this dog food!,1
"I bought this feeder since the last one I got was too old and it was starting to break down. At first the feeder was working fine. It gave the amount of food to the dog I programmed and at the times I set up. It was working perfectly, until I had to left my dog for 4 days at my place with the feeder. I never leave my dog alone for too long, but I had no choice at this time and that's the reason I bought this feeder on the first place. The feeder stopped working the day I left and it DIDN'T RELEASE FOOD  to my dog for 4 days. My wife and I feel so bad and can't stop crying about that. I tried changing the amount of food that goes into the feeder for just half instead of filling it to the line it says could be filled. Again, it worked for 2-3 days and then stopped working. It will start again and boom stop for no reason. I think this one is broken or it doesn't have the strength to release the food or support the weight of the food inside.
You will notice when it stopped working (does not feed your pet) because the breakfast, lunch or dinner options in the screen will be blinking.
So basically,  if you love your pets, I recommend you not to buy this feeder... If you do you might get a surprise when it stops working when you need it the most.
I'm returning it and look for another option.",0

"Smells great and makes my cat's fur soft, but does nothing to relieve itchiness. Tried a couple of times with the same result. Cat continues to scratch and lick constantly even after use.",0
Tray came broken--shipped with another item in great packaging which leads me to believe it was broken before it went in the shipment box. I needed the item so I taped it instead of returning it.,0
"These made my puppy throw up and get lethargic for 36 hours before finally managing to pass a undigested chunk of this thing. Only feed this to your dog if you're trying to kill them. There is a class action lawsuit because this is not healthy and will definitely hurt your puppy. Bigger dogs might be too big and strong to get sick but still, why feed your dog BS? The ingredients come from China and we all know Chinese pet food kills.",0
"So glad I just bought my usual $40 bag of food....this is not the same food at all, with no warning. My cats hate it and I want my money back.",0
These clippers do jot run strong I do not recommend buying!! I bought to clip my horses mane and to clean up Whisker's and they are not stonge enough to cut threw the hair it takes many times!,0
Wish I would have returned this.  Did not work with my dogs.,0
I used this on my dog's paws to help protect them from the 120 degree heat and resulting scorching hot asphalt of Phoenix. Didn't work. My poor babies were still doing the hot asphalt dance and we had to sprint everywhere so their paws weren't on for too long.,0
"I have 2 Doxies and ordered these because they looked to be a great training treat.  I received, opened and got 1 out - it immediately crumbled into a million pieces in my fingers - all over my floor.  this would be great if you have a dog that won't eat - maybe put a few crumbles on top of his food.  But for treats - I personally would not recommend.",0
I was expecting much better quality than this brush.  I used it once and the bristles have already started to bend backwards.  I have a small dog with medium length hair - this brush won't last long.,0
"Hands down my dogs favorite toys.. we buy multiple sets at a time.  Yes, the squeaking is obnoxious, but these are the most durable balls we've found and for our chew monster we appreciate the longevity.",1
"Don't know what my pup would do without his Kong!!!  Great product and USA made, which is important to me for anything I buy my little man.  Thank you, Kong!!!!",1
"Since the arrival of my dog's ""new baby"", he's been licking continuously making it his own. I'm sure this one will get plenty of loving and be incorporated into the daily exercise/play routine... he hasn't allowed ME to play with it yet!

This is high quality, it's firmly and fully stuffed with the squeaker deeply imbedded and worth the contentment my Furbaby and I both receive. The toy's squeaker inside, definitely gets his attention and is deep enough inside I don't panic he'll gnaw it out and swallow it when I'm not looking. Something that happened with a similar toy made of blue terry cloth not as firmly/fully stuffed. That situation caused me to reach into his mouth to get the 2-piece squeaker out. I did repair and reinforce that old toy so there wouldn't be a repeat performance or worse when I'm not watching.

I'm sure I'll have to wait till he's asleep to wash it like his ""old baby"". He has a fit if you pick up his toy and don't play catch with him. He prefers cloth toys for tugging or catch games. I hope you have as much fun and pleasure with your FurBaby as I do...this toy adds the enjoyment for both!",1
"What can I say, my dog loves these.",1
I received this stroller for Christmas. The tires came nearly flat and don't hold air for long. So many other strollers come with no-flat/airless tires and are great. Unfortunately I gave up my other stroller for this. What a mistake! Don't purchase a stroller with air tires. That's why this has to come with a cheap little hand pump...because you're going to be spending your time inflating the cheap tires,0
"This super high protein, low carb food seems to helping me address my cat's diabetes. I was able to reduce her dose of insulin by half and the vet and I are hopeful that we may be able to control her diabetes without injections. Yay! This food really is a best friend to felines...and their owners, too!",1
Perfect. Cant ask for more on this. Should have bought this a long time ago. Going to the pet stores for something like it wa way more money.,1
A,1
kids loved these!,1
"Doesn't work.  I gave this regularly to my dog, not breaking for the winter months, and still had the unpleasant surprise that some recent scratching was fleas.  Frontline's 'satisfaction guaranteed' policy only applies to purchases directly from veterinarians.",0
Bought multiples and none of them matched temps and humiidity even with brand new batteries! Would not buy again,0
Slows my dog down when he's eating,1
"Our basset hound loves these, as you can tell from the photo! They're very light, so you definitely get more than you'd anticipate.",1
"I have 2 dogs with allergies and this shampoo really helps.  Please note - you should leave it on for 5 minutes so that it  has time to work.  I like the fragrance and a little goes a long way.  Great lather, rinses easily too. More affordable on Amazon than it a pet store also.",1
I wish we would have had a Gentle Leader eons ago with the number of dogs I've owned. We used to walk our dog with a choker and needless to say she would want to pull toward a bunny rabbit or another dog and we just had no control over her. Ever since we got the Gentle Leader it's been great. Our dog does not pull like you think she would AND there are no more thoughts of being pulled to the ground or even a risk of her getting away. I would recommend this type of collar for any dog in which you want to train not to pull away. Instead she can only go in a circle and then forgets about other distractions.,1
Best ever!  I can't stop laughing when I have this on my pup.  I does run a little smaller than I thought.  I got a medium and I have a pugle so I would go up in size but I would absolutely recommend it.  It is seriously so funny!,1
"Have used these crates for 40+ years of showing dogs and they sure are not what they used to be. Crate was delivered in large cardboard box and when opened corner was badly chipped. Plastic is much more hard and riged then my older cages. I am sure it will not stand up to much usage.  Note to self, better go back to metal dog cages in the future.",0
"In our entire life, and years and years with Amazon, we have never written a negative review.
And as an attorney, it is not our motive to disparage this Vitamin and its company.

However, this product arrived on Thursday evening, April 4, 2017, and we immediately gave our healthy, 14 yr old 10 lb, Barrister, one vitamin with her dinner.
To not make this an epic, after never-experienced, intense agitation at 1:00 AM for 45 mins, we knew the 24 hour Vet was urgently needed.

Getting in car, she had her 1st ever seizure, followed by 4-5 more by end of day Friday at our regular (22 years) Vet--all the time being told by the attending docs that she Must be put down, even providing a private room for a 'death vigil.'

When she began licking my face and wagging her tail, albeit barely able to stand and somewhat cognitively impaired, all the time hearing 'it is time; she cannot survive', we decided we had seen her seining and could endure what was to come, and would prefer she die in our arms at home, thus, we left.

One long week was all it took: of no walks, not eating (11-7 lbs), barely knowing us nor able to walk wit falling, and incontinent, while letting Google Vet sites give us guidance, she is now completely her old self, eating like horse, barking (almost never before barked and sleeping on our bed...she never, never slept there)...AND NOT ONE SINGLE SEIZURE SINCE April 5th...

Thankful to our God, we are grateful for each day we have left w her... but are not we all?

Just give your pet, to start, a teeny, tiny bit of one vitamin, and slowly titration up--if they have no reaction.

Vets said was 'no way' it was the vitamin, and I still have hard time believing it was...

But she DID react to something that was Not a medical concern... and though vets say 'once a seizure, always seizures', our Barrister, and us, seems blessed to have beaten the medical odds..
Our Best Blessings to all....",0
a little heavy to lift but i ordered it,1
Smells horrible - made me vomit.,0
"They used to be a 5 star product and I bought them exclusively. This last shipment I received, the quality is NOTICEABLY worse and every single bad has ripped or shredded in some way.

Now I'll be looking for a new brand after I go through these bags.",0
Improved my dogs breath but he absolutely hated and eventually feared the spray. I am not of the fact this is alcohol based either.,0
Not at all as pictured,0
"I have a 2-year-old Golden Retriever who LOVES this toy. Just a note, it is certainly not invincible. However, my dog really seems to enjoy playing with it and then pulling out the squeakers one by one, which makes it last a lot longer than some other toys. Considering that this was the second one I've bought (after he ripped out all 12 squeakers in the first snake), I'd say the snake was a good buy and I would recommend it. It's also 6 ft. long and he trips over it, which is pretty entertaining.",1
I asked dog if he liked it.  No comment.  But he eats it with relish and has done so for most of his ten year life.,1
"I thought Wellness made great healthy cat food, but these pouches were awful. My two cats wouldn't touch it! The ""meat"" was like artificial pre-formed squares. I guess the big price reduction should have given me a clue.
I gave the whole box away to our local kitten adoption center.",0
"We measured our dog and chose the xxl according to the sizing chart but it was waaay too large. So go with your gut on the sizing, not the size chart. Also the color was shown as a blue purple but arrived as bright purple.",0
Very cool - kitty loves these!  Highly recommend!,1
Change of heart. I wouldn't put this on a Pig in heat...I don't think they're humane.,0
"I bought this product one size smaller than I measured because there were lots of reviews stating that the chart was wrong. In the end the chart is right and the raincoat came one size smaller, so I'll have to buy a new one now trusting the chart. So either the other reviewers don't know how to measure or the seller fixed the chart. Another complaint that was frequent in the reviews was about the ""strong chemical smell"". The product is made from very good plastic (like from those thick yellow human raincoats) and this plastic has a characteristic smell when new and packaged, but it will fade out quickly with usage. So it really is nothing to worry about (my dog didn't care at all).",1
I got the yellow with grey crosses for my black lab.  I love this collar!  Very nice quality.  So much so that I ordered collars for my cat and dashound also from Blueberry and I love them too.,1
Nice quality leather. I would buy it again!,1
"Arrived quickly, but my dog still suffers with anxiety during storms.",1
"Nice, but too heavy.",0
Kens food is top notch in my book!,1
"The service dog tags are made very cheaply, I've had it for less then one month and the cheap stickers are peeling and breaking off (the very most important part of a service animal vest) also the XXS is not XXS as the last vest we purchased 3 years ago so we had to use the new tags on her old vest... Very disappointed",0
"The ball is built solid enough but my dog, and my friends dog don't seem the least bit interested.  My dog is older but his dog is 4 years old which suprises me. Im not going to challenge the ad but im sure there was testing to find which dogs will be attracted to this ball. Not a bit different than advertising kids toys.  The ad makes you think the kid loves it but actually the kid wants to play with the box.  Save your money.  For the price you could do much better.",0
"I thought it would be bigger my small boston terrier, 15 lbs. doesn't fit, and it doesn't isn't made as good as I thought it should be for the price",0
Get vest! This is the second one I have purchased and they are great!,1
"I got these to toss at a neighbor's boxer every time he barks. Sometimes he stops barking a bit while he eats these, but it is not entirely successful in getting him to consider me a good guy. He does hunt down every one of these and eat them up, though.",1
"We have a 38 lb 18 month old border collie. And a 12 week old baby. So the border collie needs things to keep her occupied, interactive, and ""working"" while relatives visit. This fits the bill as well as their other pull toys which she still plays with. She loves teaching visitors to play and everyone seems to enjoy playing tug with her. This is a bit easier for older relatives to hold on to and people without a lot of hand strength (grandparents). The football is quite big especially as our pup is such a tiny thing (my last dogs were 70 lbs and 112 lbs so 38 lbs is a big change) but she manages nicely. We've had it a few weeks and it still looks new despite daily play.",1
"I was skeptical at first but I was desperate to help my 2 dogs. The daily scratching, dry flaky skin, loss of hair, thinning of the hair and licking their paws raw was too much for me to bear. After researching online I realized that my dogs were not getting enough vitamins from their food even though they are eating a top brand, so I decided to purchase Nutri- Vet along with Little Stinker Rapid Relief Probotic Body Spray. It's been a week and I can't believe my eyes!!!... No more flaky, itchy, smelly dogs. I squirt enough Nutri-Vet onto their dry food along with a few squirts of Little Stinker daily, I also spray Little Stinker on their body, face, mouth, and anal every couple of days. I have tried so many products and every time I've been disappointed with the results. I can't rave enough about these 2 products please if your dog is experiencing any of the same symptoms buy both products and you will never try anything else. To get the results you need Please purchase both, you won't be disappointed!!  I will never be without Nutri-Vet and Little Stinker!!",1
not what I expected - looks much better in the picture!,0
"My dog loves it, good fit for her too",1
"We were so sure our puppy would destroy the ""tusks"" on this toy immediately.  After two months, they still look great, and he loves chomping and ""throwing"" it up in the air.  He keeps himself occupied quite well with this toy, and it holds up to a teething juvenile puppy mouth quite well.
Nice size, good squeaker, good construction, somewhat floppy (but I consider that a ""pro"" rather than a ""con""), ""fur""-type fabric seems to have a protective factor to resist tearing and destructive jaws/teeth.",1
"Worked great for 3 months. Today the plastic hinge cover broke and the hinge flew apart while opening.  Not repairable and past return date. Maybe this gate isn't designed for high traffic areas?

Follow up: I am updating my review because manufacturer support of this product was fantastic.  Even though I was beyond the Amazon return date, Midwest Homes for Pets replaced the gate under their 1 year limited warranty.  It only required two email exchanges and a couple pictures of the broken gate.

Thanks Midwest Homes for Pets and Customer Service Supervisor Angie!",1
Our duck quit quacking after five minutes of play.  My small dog doesn't like the duck anymore and doesn't play with it.  It seemed great at first but didn't last.,0
"It's a small cute figure perfect to decorate your room, if you are a spongebob fan. I once dropped this from a table, and the middle leaf fell apart from the body :(",1
"I bought a few toys, and scratchers for my cat and all arrived together and i put them on the floor together, left the room for something and a minute later my cat was stuffed into it. He loves it, but he's a big guy (24 lbs) and can't fit into it so he kinda stuffs himself in...funny to see him with his tummy hanging all over it, but he lays in there for hours...i ts great but..i only wish they made a bigger one.",1
I love it! You just need to brush it gently. The matts get off very easily!,1
my cat loves it,1
Even with a tremendous amount of effort this did not rid our new dark tweed fabric furniture of the fur deposits by two Siamese. This was my final try short of covering it  and then what is the point?  I have used every trick on the Internet short of shaving the cats.  This will be great for mild cat removal like a regular lint roller but not heavy duty cat hair removal.,0
Bugs still get into it. That was the sole reason I bought this. To keep them out. Now its just junk.,0
Top and bottom didn't want to align. Slightly different than what is pictured. No petmate label like shown. I think this is the cheaper carrier. I have several old ones but needed a new one for a new bird. Overpriced for sure and cost more for the pink color.,0
The door doesn't open very well. It gets stuck. The plastic one is much easier to connect pieces.  This metal one just isn't as nice as the plastic one.,0
"I use this to feed my cat his dinner while I'm at work and his breakfast so I can sleep in. After I get up in the morning, I refill the bowls and reset the timers for his dinner and next day's breakfast.
Pros:
Light weight
Slide out food trays are easy to clean
No problems with kitty acne that some cats get from plastic food dishes
I bought this in November 2015. Now we're in April 2016. The battery has not died yet.

My only two complaints are:
There's no way to get it kibble out when it falls in the gap between the lid hinges and the main body
and
2) My cat is smart enough to claw out the removable white trays from under the lids and devour both meals at one time when he's feeling frisky. I had to use clear tape on the top edges of the trays(nearest the timer) to secure them to the main body and thwart his overeating.

The automatic feeder shipped quickly and was securely packaged. Other than the few times my cat finagled his food trays, it's been a reliable two-meal automatic feeder.",1
Received but didn't work. Replaced battery- still didn't work.  Looked inside - a piece had broken off that holds battery in place.,0
It was adorable,1
POS CRAP  DIDNT WORK  BATTERIES DID NOT ACCEPT  TOTAL JUNK,0
Whimpy plant that isn't going to survive.,0
I can see this food is nourishing but I have tried many other nourishing dry foods which my 15 year old cat would not eat at all.  I am happy to report that he loved this food and scarfed it down as did the two other cats I am taking care of right now.  I feed him mostly wet food but a little custard cup of dry food at night so he doesn't wake me up too early.  I am delighted to have found a new dry food that he likes and will continue to buy it.,1
"My cats hate toys. And they're not generally catnip fans. But they keep playing with these for months.

I've bought a few. They're not super cheap. But having them going crazy on them over and over and over makes it worth it. If you're looking for a passive toy for your cat, go for it.",1
"I purchased the pen at a local pet store but they were out of covers.  I ordered 2 covers--one for under the pen and one for on top.  I keep my 3 bunnies in this pen and several times they did manage to jump over it.  Therefore, when I'm away from the home, I put the extra cover on top for their safety.  The cover is very well made and extremely durable, even with bunnies chewing on it occasionally.",1
"MY CAT JUST LOVES  IT.. 50 DEGREE ANGLE ASSURRES ALL 4 FEET GET A GRIP.. NICE TOY, INSIDE.. I SPRINKLE  KONG CAT NIP, ON IT .. HAPPY KITTY!",1
"This bed is not very durable, the cover material is thin an rips easily, and inside it is just the regular cheap egg-carton type foam.  My small dog (a 14 lb bichon frise) dug at the bed and destroyed it the first day he used it, the cover ripped open and the foam inside was shred into small pieces all over the rug.  He isn't exactly the most destructive dog either, the cheap $30 dog bed we replaced with this one lasted two years, and we only decided to replace it because it was dirty.  I wouldn't buy this again.",0
"Sorry to say I had to return, my dogs threw up everytime I gave it to them",0
Neither the cats nor I can detect any catnip smell. None of our 4 cats has any interest in them. I feel deceived by the seller. These must be very old.,0
"The cans were damaged, broken open, and spoiled. Apparently there's no return policy for this kind of problem. Very unhappy.",0
"I spent weeks pulling my hair out trying to figure out why I had ammonia in my already cycled tank.  Then I finally discovered that almost all water conditioners (dechlorinators) cause a false positive in the first 24 to 48 hours after using them when you use most ammonia test kits out there such as API, etc.  This little device measures ONLY the free ammonia in your tank.  Turns out I had 0 free ammonia in my tank but I was getting the false positive reading after doing numerous water changes to try to get my ammonia to 0 and of course adding new water conditioner each time to save my shrimp and fish from ammonia poisoning.  Now I can breathe easy and just enjoying my fish tank.  All you have to do is peel off the plastic covering and put it anywhere in your tank and it's ready to go. I do periodic backup checks with the Seachem Ammonia Multitest kit which is another fantastic product,  as it measures Free ammonia and ALSO Bound (by water conditioner) ammonia in your tank.",1
"Dog still barks as normal with this on. Bought size 1/X-Small for 11 pound terrier. Does not work at all, does not even help to reduce the volume of his barking.",0
I like these liners as the plastic is very thick so the cat does not scratch holes in it like some other bags. And they are unscented as well as I do not like some of the scents they use in some cat products.,1
It was what I need,1
"Really allows for ""more"" time in between cleaning without the 'smell'. Although the carefresh paper bedding is a tad more expensive it is MUCH LESS odor than the shavings plus or shavings alone and keeps the bottom of my cage from being ""urine damaged"". We have two guinea pigs and they seem much happier without the pokey shavings!",1
Bought this product for my grandmas cat for Christmas she absolutely loves it,1
"My cat is 13 and has an endocrine problem, so jump up and down off of the surfaces she used to has been very difficult for her...especially the bed, which she loves to sleep on. These stairs are perfect for her. She took to them right away. Now she can climb on and off the bed whenever she wishes. I am so happy with this purchase. They are so well made and heavy enough that they will not fall over when she climbs them. Perfect!",1
"The first time I gave my cat the treats (just shy of 1 year old, seemed to have an iron stomach) he was fine.  The 2nd time, he vomited one time shortly afterwards.  At this point, I didn't put together that it was the treats, we have two little kids and I berated them for feeding the cat something he shouldn't be eating. Third time, I knew the kids hadn't given him anything and he vomited almost immediately and continued to vomit until all he had left was bile.  I see the pattern now.  NOTHING else has made him sick.

If you check the reviews for this product, but the hairball control variety, you will see NUMEROUS reports of cats getting sick.  In to the trash they go.

Cat will be 1 year old on Feb. 29th (yes, leap year, so we will count Feb. 28th instead) Snowshoe/Manx mix, being fed Blue Wilderness Evolutionary Diet Indoor dry and canned.  We have no other instances of him getting sick.  ONLY in direct connection with these treats.",0
Sturdy and easy to build. I have 3 large cats and they play and sleep on it all day.,1
"Not the paranoid pet owner, wife got this puppy mill dog, and even though we've made her queen of the house she spooks easily. Found this collar, did some research, decided to give it a try, but it actually gave her diarrhea. Took it off and it went right away. Although think about the world of prescription drugs, some people get side effects, and some don't.",0
Love this for my chihuahua. Stays on snug and is so adorable. Plus its not stiff enough that it would irritate him,1
work well with doggit training pad holder,1
Absolutely fix the concern with Sage (the cat). Now it is feed daily she likes it and there was no negative digestive issues.,1
what a piece of  jumk. total waste of money. flimsy. tore almost immediately. I threw it out. DON'TBUYIT>,0
"I've tried several other pellets and my Betta just wouldn't eat them... she was stuck on eating flakes which caused the water to become dirty faster, but that has all changed! I've been using the pellets for over a month now and she still loves them! The packaging is a little tricky, I would suggest emptying out the entire contents into another easier to use container... but other than that no complaints!",1
"Perhaps you don't have an aggressive chewer. If you dog tends to hold an item in its paws and pull at it with its front teeth, it will be able to pull the foam out of this toy in less than a minute. Ours did; thankfully they did not eat the foam. I imagine that for less-aggressive chewers the toy would have a nice soft mouth feel, but four our dogs this toy ended up in the trashcan within minutes.",0
"I'm a bit OCD when it comes to my truck and having 2 large dogs with long hair would always torture me when I took them with me because of their shedding on my seats. The cover works great but when I use it as a hammock the straps that go around the headrests don't cinch up as close as I'd like, leaving room for the cover to move around and needs to be constantly adjusted because my dogs weight seems to pull the straps giving more slack. Aside from that minor issue it works and looks great. When not in use I simply fold it up against my backseat and it's ready to go whenever I get my dogs.",1
"My kitten isn't used to being kept strictly inside, he knows when this comes out he can go run outside and he loves it.",1
"We have been giving our dogs best Bully sticks for years, but after the constant price increases and quality decreases it really isn't worth the price.  My dogs still love them, but will start shopping around after the last two batches.",0
it was to big and it didn't help with my dogs anxiety,0
This really gets less than a star. My boys are way too smart for this.,0
The product is as advertised. It seems to work for my young 80lb Lab who can get a case of the crazies once in a while. So far he's not managed to pull it out of the ground.,1
The smell of cheap perfume.  I had to give this to the goodwill.  I think the order was also toxic!,0
Useless.  I bought this to keep my cat off the new couch.  The smell keeps me off the couch.  The cat couldn't care less.,0
the finches love this,1
I purchased these enzymes for my 8 year old standard poodle who has been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.  She is doing much better. I am adding the enzymes to homemade dog food. I am feeding her 3 times a day.  She is also getting other things that I will not go into.  She has normal stools now and lots of energy. I'm very pleased with this product.,1
Can't beat the price. Can't beat the price. Perfect for my 55 gallon tank. Very quiet and very easy to install.,1
"These brine shrimp eggs have an excellent hatch rate. Just a tiny pinch, barely enough to even make a dent in the amount of eggs in the vial, will quickly give you a tank brimming with healthy shrimp hatchlings. Just be careful and don't add too many or you can easily end up with more shrimp than you'll know what to do with.",1
"I just recently bought an 8 week old corgi puppy who had to be shipped from Kansas to Philadelphia. I was looking for something that I could use on him once he had gotten out of his cargo crate since I knew him getting a bath that day was out of the question. I came across these wipes and found them to be the perfect fit or wiping a pup down! These wipes are true to size (bigger than an average wipe) and leave your pup feeling much cleaner. I will definitely be using these for the times he is outside playing in the grass, etc.  I really like that there is no scent to them but it takes the stinky smell out of your bed. What got me hooked the most was how natural Pogi's products are! As a matter of fact, I just ordered the stain remover and deodorizer and cannot wait to use it on the small accents my pup has had on the carpet.",1
Overall nice product but only lasted a few days before our chewer ripped into it.,1
"I was very disappointed by this product. I initially purchased because I read many positive reviews. I have a Sheltie/Lab mix pup, along the small to medium size. This did not fit her well. I went by the sizing chart. It fit around the chest area, but the neck area even adjusted to the tightest was loose. Going down a size would have then made the chest area too small. It also did not prevent pulling like it says, which is the number one reason I needed this kind of harness. When she would pull the neck area was sloppy and loose and did not do what it was supposed too. Also the neck area would loosen on walks as any tugging and pulling caused the adjustable straps to loosen. I do not recommend this product, it does not stop pulling and does not fit properly.",0
"I am not absolutely sure how well these work compared to brushing, but I do know they work better than other wipes I have used.  I have small dogs, breeds known for tartar buildup problems, and these have definitely worked well.",1
Worked well for our mix breed dog.  Seemed much more comfortable than regualar cone collars.  Would buy again if we needed it for another pet.,1
"My 13 year old Labrador eats everything...except joint supplements. I have purchased every brand out there and each time I had to coat them in peanut butter and she would still manage to spit them out about half the time. Then I found these under another name at Tractor Supply and finally found a product the the dog I thought was the least picky about everything on the planet would eat. Then after the first bottle, they didn't have it anymore. Then I saw this on Amazon and while it is a different brand name it is the same product at about the same price. I am glad that Amazon has this great product.",1
"This is such a great idea!  My dog had a surgery on her leg and I thought this would be perfect.  Unfortunately, she has a cast on that covers the whole foot.  This sleeve has a cuff, which is great to keep it in place, but it won't fit over the cast.  I decided to keep it anyway and if I don't use it, I will donate it to my local animal rescue.  If you're considering this, keep in mind that if your dog is a real chewer (mine isn't) they will probably just chew it off.  It's just made out of fabric.",1
"Very well made and larger than I expected, a good thing. Very good deal for the money.",1
We saw a difference in our dog in DAYS.  It's amazing,1
"The dogs enjoyed the treats themselves however once the treats are placed inside of the Kong, they become virtually impossible to get out by a human much less a dog. Do yourself a favor and fill the Kong with peanut butter as opposed to these peanut butter Kong treats.",0
"I saw these on another site and came here to see if I could find some.  I ordered the ""friendly"" ones for my two greyhounds.  People are always asking me if they're friendly and the leash says it all!  This is a great idea and they come in other choices too!",1
didn't work,0

I bought one to try out for my 5 cats and they are taking turns. The bed is always in use. I have to buy more of the heated beds because they are fighting over who gets to lay in it. I never turn it off. It stays on at all time. My cats LOVE it,1
The pigs love their new bowls,1
Very poorly made.,0
This bag of food and the last one were both past the best but date printed on them. I get the grain free one. I'm very disappointed and will be canceling my subscription.,0
"I was so excited to find a corner cage, but oh I wish I would have never seen it.  I bought it and the box arrived all banged up and of course several pieces were bent.  Then I tried to put it together and already at step one, had  to stop and ask the company to send me several replacement parts because the bottom shelf did not align with the screw holes.  So they sent me several parts but not the most important one.  Had to call them again (because my e-mails seemed to be ignored) and finally got the part today.  Nothing is easy with this cage.  Much does not align very well, and when I got to the top part where the top shelf is to be installed, it's totally out of alignment, I mean there is no way to bend or force it into fitting.  Very unhappy with this purchase.",0
Best thing ever,1
I purchased a total of 3 buckets and 2/3 were defective.  The seal around the bottom broke and water leaked into the floor of the bucket presumably where the electric components are located.  Risk of electric shock seems possible when this happens.  They need to work on quality control.  Won't be purchasing these again ... will stick to plastic heated buckets that are made of 1 solid piece of plastic.,0
"This seems like a great product for the price. I did a ton of research on this purchase because I was also buying one as a present for my in-laws. This one has pretty good ratings on multiple websites. Its best features are how quiet it is, there are no special litter or trays to buy, and the special bags for the easy to empty and catcher tray are affordable or you can use bread bags to save $. I have always used a covered box to try and help contain the smell and my cat makes a lot of digging noise in them so I was really worried about how this box would be with smell and litter mess. So far I'm in love. My cat used it after less than 30 min.  I was sure it would smell but it didn't even a little bit! He did dig a lot still, but surprisingly he didn't get litter anywhere. 15 min later it scooped it out no problem. I had to happy dance around the room. My cat isn't especially skittish, and he doesn't seem afraid of it, just really curious. I'm glad the sensor will keep it from activating with him in it though. I will update my review in a week or so; hopefully it keeps working out perfectly!

Update#1 Later in January: After my cat used the box another couple times I realized my cat box difficulties were not over. It works great at scooping out the poo, but not the urine clumps so much. I am going to try out a different litter next time I purchase some, something that says it clumps really well because that seems to be the problem, along with the fact that it since it uses less litter my cat is continually digging to the bottom of the box, moving all the litter to one side, before using it. This creates a big clump that cements itself to the bottom and the motor isn't strong enough to scoop that kind of mess, so it makes some weird popping sound that doesnt sound good for it at all. Also I was wrong about him not getting litter everywhere. He isn't really flinging it around when he digs, but when he jumps out and walks away I can literally hear litter flying all over the place (GROSS!)  My only other complaint is that the odor eliminating active carbon filter is about 1 inch by 2 inches and they expect it to stay attached to the lid by one hole and one plastic stick that you poke it onto. What a joke! It falls off very quickly, but it is so small I don't think it would do much of anything anyway.

Update #2 Feb. 25- After some trial and error I have decided that this was a good purchase. I bought better litter, and while there still ends up being some small pieces that I still have to clean out, it does clump better so the urine clumps are getting removed. To stop the digging to the bottom of the box I just had to use more litter. All other cat boxes, and on the boxes of litter, it says cats need 3-4 inches of litter to feel comfortable, and the max line is only about 2 inches. I fill the box with litter a little over the top max line; since doing so he has stopped digging to the bottom and he digs in it less after he is done too. The litter being scattered everywhere was  more difficult issue. I had to figure out how to get my cat to only exit the box from one direction so he is forced to walk on the litter catching mat. I did this by turning the box with the catcher box facing out (my cat won't jump over it, he is scared of it), and I taped a paint stick to the box so that he has to walk around it and stay on the mat for a few steps. It is a little hokey, but it works.
All and all I still end up cleaning up after my cat a little everyday, the chore has just became a little easier and A LOT less gross, so it is worth it in my opinion.",1
"I purchased these for my Scottish terriers. They started to pull apart along the top seams the first time they wore them. I resewed the handles so that they were pulling from underneath, not just the top fabric. The design needs improvement so that the handle and side straps are all the way thru the flotation not just in the top material.",0
I bought this hoping it would make my life easier but the crystals don't last very long and they don't hide the odor of cat feces at all.  You can always tell when there is fresh cat feces in the box and the box is in another room.  The crystals get everywhere although I have to admit that when I bought the carpet and the box cover the amount of loose crystals went down considerably.  I have 2 young cats and I can only get about 10 days before I have to change out the crystals which gets costly.  I will be trying another style box very soon.,0
Fell apart in a couple of weeks. Go with Hyper Pet or Floppy Disk instead.,0

All it does is pull on my dog's mat. Another reviewer recommended it for goldendoodles, I do not. Maybe it works best for dog's with straight hair but if your dog has curly or wavy hair, expect it to be pulled. Back to the drawing board to find another solution. Such a waste of $25 bucks :-(

***EDIT*** 5.6.16
I wrote the company regarding my issue and they submitted a refund. It's nice that there are companies out there that stand by their word regarding customer satisfaction. The company gets 5 stars.",0
Just received it today and already love it. I think my 100 pound dog approves too.,1
"I wish I could give this 0 stars, unfortunately I can't so it's going to be 1. This litter has absolutely no odor control at all. We have 2 litter boxes for our 3 cats, and we have scooped it daily, it's been 3 days with this litter and the entire house reeks. Our normal litter was out of stock so I took a chance on this one because of the Arm & Hammer brand, but I will never purchase this again. Thankfully our regular litter is going to be here today and we can get rid of this stinking, horrible litter!",0
"I would give this a 0 star review if I could. Might as well buy the cheap dollar store toys - lasted just about the same amount of time. This toy was rated a 9 and under supervision as requested on the product, within 10 minutes the fabric was breached and the stuffing began to flow like cotton candy.",0
"The wipes were dried out when I received them, and I ended up just throwing them away",0
Excellent ledge. Adds color and activity for my chin. Perfect size and healthy for gnawing. Definitely would recommend for chins.,1
I followed the directions and used multiple doses with no results. I was surprised because I've used Capstar in the past and it worked with just one dose.,0
Nice and thick and well made.  A little expensive but my Sparky is worth it.,1
My dog loves these biscuits.,1
"The toy itself looks durable and tough, and hard enough to soothe our pup's gums while she's teething. However, she was able to chew off the light green fuzz and tried to eat it within minutes. We let her play with this twice and both times had to pry her mouth open to get the fluff out. Too bad because it seemed like good quality.",0
Love the idea. She can still chew her paws though.. but she never wore it long enough to see how well it works. Apparently her dad thinks she looks too sad with it on. Lol oh those black lab puppy eyes!,1
Works!,1
"Best thing they have ever invented, it's soft and it doesn't strangler my dog.",1

"worked wonders for my two older cats! With the years my fur babies have been moving and jumping less, bu this got them back moving in no time.",1
"My cat loved playing with the ball underneath this, but she doesn't use it as a scratcher at all. She continues to use the couch instead.",0
love the product.,1
The actually product seems fine so far. My problem is I purchased a new one for a new price. I received a used one. I know it was used because it had algae between the plastic.  I bought two and the other one had a sticker on the head as well. Not sure if I am going to exchange it or just keep it.,0
This is NOT a high fiber dog food and should not be listed under high fiber dog foods.,0
They enjoyed them much to fast :),1
Very thick and difficult to get on and off.,0
"Not sure if I received a bad batch, but my cat now refuses to eat these and they have a different, almost chemical smell to them. If the formula changed, then that's unfortunate since the pills have worked exceptionally well the last 4 years and my cat loved to eat them.",0
"As much as I thought that my small dogs would love this toy, they simply don't seem to after they initially checked it out. I got creative though and put some coconut oil on it to get them more interested. It also has a hole down the center that I am able to put a little peanut butter in or a small treat so they can enjoy that as well and keep busy. I am sure that other dogs would totally love this as the design is great and the spikes are soft enough. It is a great concept for helping keep their teeth clean. Perhaps with a little more coaxing and playing I will get one of them to find it to be their favorite at least for a little while, as I do rotate their toys. I was able to catch a couple pictures of my female playing with it when the coconut oil was on it so you can see the sizing. She is about nine pounds but taller than most Chihuahuas as she is a mixed breed. I am not giving up on this toy for sure and will update my review if something changes. It isn't the toy's fault that my fur babies are particular with their chew and play toys lol. I did receive this at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. I rely on reviews when making purchases also so I only provide honest feedback on items I have actually tried and tested.",1
"I purchased this product to replace the now rusty rake in my older Scoopfree box. Very soon after I installed the rack machine stopped working and would just blink rapidly in error, regardless of what I do or how many times I reset it.

my dogs favorite,1

Too small for my yorkie,0
Works for my hair clippers. Keeps them clean/rust free and quiets them down.,1
"These smell good and are good for dog's skin and coat, but they are pretty expensive. The small bag only has enough treats for a little under 2 weeks given twice a day.",1
"I started using this toy with my dog, and in less than two hours, she broke it into two pieces.",0
the price on this can't be right.....269. ?  I love the Litter Locker II....but that price is wrong,0
Purchased nov 4 and the motor died end of Feb.  So sad and of course no warranty.  It would make a lot of noise if the water was not filled to the rim at all times.  I never let it get low and it still dies.,0
Not suffient for my purposes.  I would need 50 bags.,0

"I feed my three big dogs (two Golden Retrievers and a Lab) the instinct dry kibble and mix in a bit of the instinct wet food.  It's so good I can simply drop any medication they need, and they will chew it up with no issues.  I also rotate flavors of wet food (lamb, chicken, beef, duck, etc) - and the dogs have no digestion issues.",1
didn't work very well,0
The filter itself is good. I already have one and it works very well. Just needed another to add to a larger tank. The problem is the filter inserts. The box was taped to the filter box with notes that said not to separate -- sell as a set. However the inserts that came with my order were not the ones that worked with this filter. Don't know who messed up -- Amazon Fulfillment or the seller -- but the ones I received were useless to me. Hope this gets fixed.,0
"Flew our 22 pound terrier mix 5000 miles across the Pacific with this.  The airline (united) accepted the kennel without modification.  It has held up very well with travel and daily use.  I would recommend.  You could certainly fit a larger dog in with no problem, its huge for our terrier.",1
Fits but I'm taking a stair away for the middle chest strap not being adjustable.,1
Fur babies took awhile to get used to it...now they fight over them! We have 2 and 4 fur babies!,1
I first ordered Large according to the discription it should have fit. But it was a little to small. I got XL today it is  very nice. No trouble returning or getting a better size. A very nice harness. And well worth the price,1
"This is a great product! It's not our dogs favorite thing, but it really helps remove the mats in her fur (shih Tzu) and it doesn't hurt her.. She just hates being brushed lol I would highly recommend this!",1
"I have been a Wellness pet food fan for years, but lately have concerns. Our two cats had been eating this particular  formula for a couple of years, it really reduced hairballs. A few months ago I noticed that both were losing weight and always seemed ravenously hungry. Both were on the counters trying to get into our food, something they hadn't done before. With one, you could not turn your head if there was raw meat around, especially hamburger. The other was always licking olive oil from our salad bowls. We increased their food, but this continued. Then suddenly both started throwing up clear liquid. One occasionally, and the other (our barf cat), at least once a day. We brought one to the vet when he got lethargic. Bloodwork showed he might be in early renal failure, and he had high calcium levels, which was puzzling to the vets. He had lost 3 pounds since his last visit less than a year earlier. They put both cats on Science Diet kd. Within days, both perked up and vomiting stopped. Within two weeks they were much more playful, and had stopped raiding the counters.
We brought our cat in for follow-up bloodwork a month later. All his bloodwork was normal and he had gained a little over a pound. She was a bit surprised at his new  bloodwork results. I told the vet about my concerns over the food. She suggested I contact the company to see if they would test the food, she said to make sure to mention the calcium.
I did contact Wellness and a very nice lady took my information (I could not give expiration date as it was smudged); but she was honest and said since there had been no similar complaints it was unlikely the company would look into it. ( FYI She did perk up when I mentioned my dog had developed loose stools which he hadn't had before on Wellness).
These symptoms and behaviors developed rather slowly, so if anyone reading this have had similar problems with your cats while they were eating this food perhaps you can notify the company - and take your cat to the vet if it is lethargic or is vomiting clear liquid. I did have one other person respond to one of my posts that her cat had suddenly become hungry all the time, something that had not happened previously on Wellness food (she was also serving canned).
If anyone has had this problem or has  more information, I would appreciate if you would comment.",0
"CHEAP QUALITY AND SUPER THIN!!  This is a very low quality protector, and there is no way it would protect my dog.  If you are looking for cosmetic protection this would work, and in reality your dogs hair and skin would protect just as well.  It would be torn completely through the first trip.  See the attached picture from our last trip.  He has had numerous the last couple of years, but two in one day was the final straw. .  They took it back and I ordered a much better quality product.",0

"The item was not in the package ,and I can't get anyone to listen. The collar I bought along with it was very small and poorly made.",0
"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO HELP ME TRAIN MY CHIHAUHAU NOT TO BARK AT EVERY PERSON SHE SEES. I HAVE BEEN USING IT A COUPLE DAYS NOW AND IM NOTICING A CHANGE. SHES SO STUBBORN SO I KNEW IT WOULD TAKE TIME, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HER DAILY. SHE STOPS THE BARKING AND TURNS HER HEAD TO ME WHEN SHE HEARS IT. IF SHE GOES BACK TO BARKING I BLOW IT AGAIN, AND AFTER A FEW TIMES SHE WILL LAY DOWN EITHER ON HER BENCH OR BY MY FEET. THIS IS A NICE LOOKING, DURABLE WHISTLE WITH A LENGTHY LANYARD TO ATTACH. I WEAR IT ALL DAY LONG WHEN IM AT HOME JUST IN CASE SHE STARTS BARKING. THE WHISTLE SET ARRIVED IN A NICE BLACK BOX WITH MAGNETIC CLOSURE. IT ALSO INCLUDED EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS AND LIFETIME WARRANTY. I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.",1
"We really did not want to get this for our dog but we had such problems with the uncontrollable barking. After much hemming and hawing, we finally decided to get one that had alternatives to shocking but could also shock as a last resort. Once we got it in I tested all 9 levels on myself and none of them hurt. Level 9 just made my hand twitch when applying it to the underside of my wrist. We then planned on how we would use this to curb the behavior which was as follows.

1. Utilize a key word for the verbal command. We used STOP
2. If the command was ineffective we vibrate the collar with using the verbal command
3. If the vibration did not work, beep the collar and use the verbal command
4. If the beep did not work, apply the shock with the verbal command.

That was our plan and suffice to say we have only used the shock once. After that the command works every time and we only need to reinforce with the beep on the collar by just taking the collar off the charger, which beeps when it is plugged in to the charger or unplugged from it. I think this is a poor choice from the manufacturer, but we have it work for us. If we have a large gathering g of people at our place we will put the collar on him just so he keeps from barking uncontrollably at other people for the first hour and gets comfortable with everyone.

But that's it. I'm so glad we have had to use the shock only once and it took a few dials to get the level he responded to as 1 - 4 elicited no reaction from him, but 5 did the trick. For anyone looking to use this, I highly recommend you go into using this collar with a clear plan and goal as to not confuse the dog as to what you want from them. So far we have only used it for excessive barking at people walking by the house. We allow a bark or two since that is ok and he now will only bark once or twice and then just growl and whine.",1
Great buy! Nicely secures on cage and love that you can easily pull the bowl out without unmounting!,1

Extremely weak pump and only lasted 8 days past 30 day return window.,0
too big for a small dog.,0
"It has been a positive experience, but not as dramatic an improvement as others have enjoyed. Our Boots dipped below 9 lbs. and is about 10.5 now.  He had been 15. Still it's the difference between skeletal and healthy looking. No vomiting, anymore than normal cat vomit. Also I feel better about our other cat, should he finish up for Boots. With the medication, there is danger of the other cat becoming Hypo vs hyper-thyroid if he gets into it.  I saw no such cautions about Thyroid Gold. I've recommended it to a relative with a cat a little farther gone, hoping for a turn around.",1
"I decided to wait a little while before leaving a review, since obviously there's no way to rate something like this without trying it out first. This is my first experience with brine shrimp and, as far as I can tell, they're doing great. Hatch rate was probably somewhere around 60%, but I'm more than willing to allow that I may not have hatched them under perfect conditions. Rather than follow the instructions on the package, I hatched them based on one of the other reviews here. My method was:

1 cycled cup water from my fish tank
Maybe 1/8th tsp of the eggs
A pinch or so of baking soda, which put the pH at 7.8

After about an hour I added 1 tsp Himalayan pink salt (later went and bought sea salt, as far as I can tell it's all fine as long as it's non-iodized)

Then I hooked up an air pump and clipped the line to the top of the jar (a regular mason jar) to keep the outlet at the bottom of the jar, and put the jar on one of those single-pad coffee cup warmers (same as a candle warmer). You can get them at Goodwill for about a dollar. That was a problem for awhile, because if you leave it on constantly it brings the water up to 100ish F, and leaving it off brings it down to about 65, so you kind of have to go back every now and then and toggle it on and off. Eventually I stuck a ceramic plate under the jar as a buffer, but that didn't keep it completely stable either. Generally, though, it stayed around 85F.

Anyway, most of the eggs hatched, and since I was planning to grow them out I transferred them to a larger tank after about 40 hours, using the same ratio for the water (1 tsp salt to 1C water). Right now I'm feeding them an ad hoc mix of spirulina powder, wheat germ, and a cichlid pellet that I crush to powder, and like I said, despite my best efforts to kill them they keep growing.

Great product, and my only regret is that, if these guys breed like I plan for them to, I won't have to buy from here again.",1
It makes quite a few different animals noises and the rubber is quite sturdy. I have 8 dogs. While it wasn't a hit with all of them a few loved it. Not only did the pups love it but I had a hard time keeping my kids from wanting to steal it lol,1
These pads are just as good as the Tidy Cat Breeze and the price is even more awesome. They are the right size for the pad drawer too.,1

"If you're like me, you have a little girl who REALLY wants to walk her hamster. Let me start with saying ""just don't do it""...seriously, don't. After waiting weeks and weeks for this thing to come, my daughter was ECSTATIC to arrive home from school to it. She immediately went and go Bullseye, her hamster, and tried to get him in it. She tried diligently for about 40 minutes before asking for help. She finally came down in tears asking for help. I tried diligently for a half hour, and we finally succeeded. Once it was around his neck, but in front of his arms, we looped the back part under...as we were doing that part, he became VERY still....at which point my daughter started crying, worried that we had choked him. While I was assuring her he was fine, I was not actually sure that he was. its a catch 22...if he can't shimmy his legs through the loop it has to be tight, if it is tight, it actually chokes him...its a lose lose. At the end of the day, realize that hamsters are not likely meant to be harnessed, or walked...stick with a hamster ball and save your $5.",0
this works well but it does not get rid of bad smells it just overpowers them with its scent which is very strong.,1

This bed is super soft. However I do not suggest for puppies or dogs that chew. The inside of the bed is soft but can be picked out by the dog. And my 10 week old puppy has already ripped the fabric. It is not sturdy enough for younger dogs.,0
"I've used clean + green ceramic tile and grout cleaner before with good results, so when we got a new puppy (and new carpet at the same time)  I decided to try this for ""oppps"" on the carpet.  I'm disappointed in the results.

For me, the true test of a urine cleaner is if the pet continues to return to the same spot when they need to go.  If they do,  the smell is still there to attract them and the cleaner isn't doing it's job.  The puppy had an accident in one spot that was immediately and thoroughly cleaned with this cleaner and he has continued to return to that spot (and that spot only).  For the cost and my result, I'd avoid this in the future.",0

Totally flavorless.  I usually share food items bought with other senior residents but not this time.  They are hard as a rock.  There is absolutely nothing good I can say about them.,0
these cartridges are very easy to replace! best value and great quality for the drinking fountain cartridges. Would recommend to those with pets.,1

So far so good with this item.  The dog I bought this for is a small 15lb dog but he chews through every toy we buy and everything ends up in the trash within a day.  He loves when we put his food in this toy and he rolls it around to get the food out.  Two thumbs up from me!!!,1

The problem is that they now turn their noses at even many of the better dog foods.  I got a sample of this dog food to try, and they will even eat it like dog treats.  Your mileage may vary, so it is best to try with a smaller bag to make sure that your dogs actually like it.  However, it is worth a try!",1

It was perfect! Just what I'd been looking for.,1
It hasn't been accomplished as yet but at least he is beginning to lay on it and claim it as where he sleeps.  I have been ordered by the love of my life to keep my dog off the furniture so I ordered the dog bed and turned the cushions on the couch up so my dog Pepper would get the idea that he now has a new place to sleep.  He wasn't at all in favor at first but after some time he seems to actually prefer it.  It looks very nice and I feel that it will be a winner in time.,1
Waste of money!!,0

My pitbull is a rednose female already done wit her first bottle and take 2tablets daily and eats chicken excerises outside she still look small in size im going to try this second bottle of 60 if no results ill b upset because i paid alot of money on um...,0
"The suit is really nice and waterproof (for real). The only thing you have to consider is the size.  My dog is 50cm long (neck to tail),  then I buy the size L, perfect for his long but not for his Chest.  My dog is long but skynny, then is  necessary a stitch because when he go to pee the suit gets wet.",1
Our puppy daughter received these for her opinion. What did she think you ask? Well Jezibell is very picky when it comes to her treats BUT she loved this one. She would eat one then go and nudge the bag with her nose for more. Needless to say her being as spoiled as she is the bag did not last long at all!! Now I have to go and order more for her. When mommy asked her what she thought she gave it 4 paws up and 2 barks! Her cute little Jack Chi face tells it all in the photos. So obviously this product is mom and dog approved and recommended!,1
"The idea of a ramp model is good but this cat scratcher just doesn't work for my 3 cats. They are happier tearing up the cardboard box that sits next to this.
The cardboard is decent--but if I had to do it again, I would buy a doublewide and a different brand. The scratcher is smaller than I expected it to be for $14.99 +frt. What I do not like about it--is that the plastic is SUPER FLIMSY-and cheap. It slides across a cement hardwood floor too easily and it's too flimsey to mount up higher for cats to scratch. The cardboard slides out of it way to easily.
If I had to do it again, I wouldn't waste my money trying to save a buck-as this is only worth $5 tops; I'd put the extra money out and get something decent.",0
I could not stand my dog's breath a minute longer. We got this toothpaste and it worked wonders. We were nervous how sensitive it was going to be on our dogs teeth but had no trouble. It works for about 2 days but overall really great compared to everything else we have tried like the mint bones that seem to just cover up the smell. And pur dog really seems to like the flavor!,1
"It took a while for one of the balls to finally sink to the bottom of my betta tank, but it did after about 4 days. The other ball sank right away in my goldfish tank. Otherwise, they're both great interesting pieces to have in any fish tank",1
I love this one cuz it has helped my puppy's dry skin dramatically... Doesn't irritate his skin.. and his itching has reduces by 80% when I use it.. I use it on him after showers on partially moist coat and then reapply every 3-4 days either alone or after cleaning him up with grooming wipes to maintain the dryness in winter..,1
My pit loved this toy but had the squeaker out on the first day then shredded it. It is NOT tough,0
"Not satisfied with this product one good thing about it, it has a good smell",0
Great product! You can see it in light and dark. The red and green are very bright! I went by some other reviews and cut them just loose enough to slip over the head and just tight enough to not shake or slip off! These are an awesome purchase!,1
Ordered this toy thinking it would replace a Bite-meez toy she had in the past.  NOT!  Poor quality.  Played with it once.  Thing fell apart.,0
I have 2 Chihuahuas and this is great. this makes my walks easy and responsible.  I love that I do not have to carry my load)(snicker) in my hands.  Look Ma No Hands...LOL!  great idea!  Love it,1
"Carrier is of very flimsy construction.  At my first and only use the clips holding the bottom to the top of the crate gave way and separated, cat inside.  Fortunately I was at my front door and cat ran in.  I do not recommend this carrier.  The older versions of Kennel Cab had screws holding the two parts together.",0
I bought two of these for my cats while driving them cross country. They never minded them and it gave me a sense of security when I was moving them that I could throw a leash on them. They are both about 7 pounds and only once did either of them manage to slip out of it (and that was more of she got on leg out but I have no idea how she did it.),1
"Trash. I only bought this because all but one review was 5 stars. I left it on for 2 days to see if it just needed time to warm up, but its still only mildly warm to the touch. Definitely doesn't put any heat to the other side of the glass let alone substrate. Very weird this is the maximum heat it puts out",0
"Did not work for our dog, will stick with frontline",0
"False advertising. No way even close to 370 gph. I timed it over and over. More like 163 gph.
False advertising! Will be returning.",0
For the price this is a very poor product.  For a third of the price it would be excellent.  Our rats have enjoyed it but the stuffing was destroyed in two days. I excepted the item to be destroyed but to be a better quality for the price.  It seems to be an 800-1000 % mark up.  will not purchase again for such a high price.  Kay tee usually has great price to quality.  Back to the drawing board guys.,0
Came as expected. I got it as a gift so it hasn't been assembled yet. Parts and pieces seem as described and I think there will be 2 very happy kitties,1
This so horrible because it's sizes are so small,0
"Made in the USA, these treats are a daily tooth brushing for RescuedPits4patriots.  Our doctor can't believe how clean their teeth are for 12, 8 and 5 years old.  They just don't like to smile for the camera but will play flipping these chips for a few hours before settling down for a good chew.",1
"Easy to install, perfect for cats who can figure out how to use it.  Unfortunately, out of my 4 cats, only 1 has figured out how to push it open to get back in.  So, for the most part, I am still pushing open the screen for them to get back and forth.  I assume they will figure it out before the summer is over!",1
Great size for two medium sized (50lb) mutts. They love their new beds very comfortable!,1
This Shock Collar was junk...it is in the trash now!!  It wouldn't work properly so we took it apart.  We found water damage inside.  This was supposed to be a brand new item.  We are very Disappointed to say the least!!!,0
This is absolutely not a waterproof bed. The plastic cover underneath the top layer has a seam and the urine leaks through that onto the foam padding. So disappointed,0
"I thought this would be like an auto feeder for my rabbit but it isnt. All it is, is a food bowl that hangs so the rabbit can't knock it over. If you fill the back the food just pours out and spills everywhere. Waste of money.",0
Did not work as well as I had hoped.  Probably works on mats.  I just needed to thin the cat's fur.,0
"I bought this and loved it for the first year... it was super convenient for taking long trips or not allowing outlets to dictate where I sit at airports.  After about a year of ownership, i took a bit of a break from travel and it sat idle for about two months.  Now, it won't charge... I can leave it plugged in for the entire day or more and I still only get one of the four lights to light up.  Definitely a bit disappointed in the product.  Not sure if Anker has a warranty on these, but they should definitely last longer than a year.",0
The smell is strong but I think it's worked for the most part.,1
Sam My cockatoo loved this toy and it has lasted longer than most -- I see a reorder in our future,1
Really cheaply made it is plastic.  I does not work at all.,0
"We received this item yesterday.  This morning, my bulldog mix found it while I was on the phone with Home Depot (missed picking it up last night), and by the time I finished the 5 minute phone call, he had chewed through it.  I know this was not meant to be a chew toy, but being from Kong I had high hopes for it.  Just glad I didn't pay $17 for it at Petco. :(",0
It worked for less than three months.  I am very disappointed.,0
"Very nice looking bottles, and what I like about them is refill from the top. I bought 2 water bottles, and they both leak very badly. I used them on my rabbit's cages. Every time the rabbits try to drink some water from it, it leaks very much makes the floor wet like pool, and the rabbits get pretty wet on the neck too. Now I stopped using them. I don't recommend to use these water bottles.",0
We purchased this kennel after a great deal of research.  It sounded so solid... Unfortunately after a year the welds failed and the door fell off.  I came home to my brand new house with my dog walking around.  I go to look at the kennel and the door is still locked but just hanging off of the kennel.  I contacted Amazon and the seller and was told sorry it has no warranty so I'm left not only with a safe place to keep my dog while I'm not at home but a $400 piece of scrap metal.  My dog is only 60 pounds.  Don't make the same mistake I did its not a cheap lesson.,0
Perfect height! Cats took right to them.,1
Fish don't like it,0
It did nothing at all for my 3 cat household. No noticeable difference.,0
"So far i wouldn't recommend this collar. Ive had mine for about a month now and the remote still won't pair with the collar. The couple time ive got it to pair, it doesn't even phase my dog who is a black lab. The only successful thing ive done with this project is waste my money!!!!!",0
"I had bought this from a local vet store before, and it is the only ear wash that works for my dogs. I tried all others and nothing beats this product! I got it from amazon and it was sealed new. Will buy again.",1

Soft and just enough cushion,1
NOPE do not buy. Item does not come with black letters as shown in photo and stated in description.,0
"**update**

I contacted the company soon after and they gave me a new collar at no extra charge. It's been a couple months and it still is working fine! My only complaint is  that when my dog shakes his head the caller sometimes turns off. But other than than I'm very satisfied and great customer service!!

Worked great for a week! Now doesn't charge at all. When I reached out to the company they did nothing  very disappointing, especially since I saw this product had great reviews",1
"I bought this box thinking that the turnover cleaning process would encourage me to do a better job keeping the box clean.  But when I put it together -- it has moveable clamps that emplace the two main pieces -- I could see that the arrangement was flimsy, and so it quickly proved to be.  After a few operations it just fell apart as I turned it.  So I tossed it in the trash (guiltily) and replaced it with an older conventional type (like what I had before, 2-piece also but firmly put together, bought it in a store where I could directly measure its firmness etc.) and am content with that.  The one I'm writing about has poorly designed attachment levers (""flimsy"" is definitely an operative adjective here).",0
We have an older small dog who needs something thats not too hard and a young pit who isn't good at sharing yet. We wanted something that was good for both dogs. Both love these things! And bite size means no one has to share.,1
"Delivery was so fast, but the procuct  did not work. And I tell you, if you planing to use this on your indoor pet, get ready to buy new furniture , bed, rug, carpet, ect, the smell dose not go away. It's smell like mouth balls my entire house after one month. I used it on my German shepherd skin problem and cuts, and didn't do any thing .",0
Arrived completely misshapen by poor packaging. Difficult to snap.,0
"After 6 months of use, it's very dirty inside. The cleaning kit is not useful at all.",0
These are not marimo. They are fiber like. I don't know if they're some kind of moss or synthetic.,0

"Really disapointed, first of all the cage came cracked. Second of all the wheels are too small for my hamster, he is a reddy bear hamster with a lot of fur and he is chubby. The only savior is the ball on top. The cage was too complicated to build also, AND it didn't have instructions, aparentely the instructions are on the box, very inconvenient. Over all i gave two stars, i was looking to improve my hamsters life, but made my life harder. Not a good product, and i haven't even described all the negatives of it. Thanks.",0

"Love all things Vetericyn. You can not go wrong with any of their products. This makes a good bubbly lather and doesn't irritate the skin. I will be back for more. I got medium hair density and fine hair density formulas ,fine for my purebred Shih Tzu, medium for my Shih Tzu mix. Works great.",1
I love this and received a lot of compliments from others.,1
"Bought the Anchovy, Sardine, Salmon and the Lamb and the dog really likes the fish. I have noticed if he gets it for both his meals he can have essence of fish breath so he only gets it once a day.",1
"This is the most revolting cat food I've ever seen or smelled, bar none.

Fortunately, I haven't been so desperate as to _personally_ experience it, because I think I'd die. But it looks awful, and my cats despise it. One of them is a whale and eats almost anything offered, but won't touch this. The other is picky and hates me now.

Strangely, the cats tolerate the ""sauce"" but reject the ""meat."" When they're done with it, it resembles a bowl of dessicated soggy cardboard scraps. (That is, on day one; on day three, it resembles a bowl of wriggling maggots. Eek - it is a bowl of wriggling maggots!)

Run away.",0
"This is the best Puppia harness I have gotten, my fourth one. The adjustability of the neck collar has been perfect to accommodate my small dog's growth as a puppy. So only had to get one size and adjust as he grew. It looks sharp on him too.",1
Definitely takes the shock off when your dog suddenly stops or goes in a different direction.  great for running with your dog.  Note - you have less control because of the stretch.  My big dogs are leashed trained so they don't really pull but sometimes on a walk or run  they stop suddenly for a sniff and this helps me not pulled with them.  I bought a small for my chinese crested retired show dog - it helps although he doesn't pull hard he is used to constant pressure on the leash when he walks and that gets tiring on my arm.,1
Made my dog puke alot. Gave it to him in small portions and still no luck.,0
"We have two golden doodles who mat easily. We hoped this would be a pain-free product to help with that issue. Unfortunately, I've found that the device largely just pulls and rips at the mats without cutting.",0

Best betta food out there. Real ingredients and my bettas go crazy over it.,1

I expected a Kong tough rubber. Instead it is a stuffed stick like a pillow. One second and it was destroyed. What a waste of money.,0
Little short on the width of my truck but grey looks nice with grey fabrics on seats.,1
These KONG toys do not live up to the KONG brand's indestructible quality. Our 70 lb mixed breed tore these apart (ripped the head off) within minutes.,0
"My dog happens to love these. Stewarts liver treats, also. Treats may be liked by some and disliked by others. There is no reason to rate a treat poorly just because your pet does not like them. I am sure each reader has foods they dislike but that is no reason to rate them poorly (like onions, pickels, horseradish, etc.) These break up nicely for small treats (dogs do not seem to care how much of a treat they get (volume) they just want one or two. These have a great bacon smell and are not messy. The thick is nice for handling but all of the Beggin strips are loved and are easy to handle. Store other treats in this bag if your dog likes this smell. I store some lamb ears in the bag and he seems to like them that much more. I cannot rate these for safety as I just do not know but they seem to be made in the states. I recommend these and they are a great price.",1
"While the rock i received was 50 pounds, i am very disappointed that it is 2 very large pieces.
The Carib Sea rock i bought was 9 rocks totalling 43 pounds.
That is what i was expecting and wanted. The picture of the product makes you believe that you will receive multiple rocks that are a little smaller in size. I could not be more disappointed.",0
"was torn and the frame bent within 3 weeks of use. I returned it promptly. it also had a terrible chemical/plastic smell that lasted the entire 3 weeks we had it. I kept thinking it would go away, but it never did. sad to say we didn't enjoy this travel crate. it does pack up nicely, though. very compact.",0
I'm a groomer and if you have a really bad dog these do not hold up and the dog can Get them off easily. If you try to adjust it tighter is very difficult and doesn't stay. Would not recommend!,0
"Easy clip to attach to collar, well made, and love the idea of the quick release handle it attach to picnic table, tree, etc. quickly if needed.",1
Quality product.,1
"This dog food contains mostly corn and disgusting animal digest (slaughter house scraps like hooves, hair, feathers, etc). People are fooled into buying this because of the commercials and packaging. These types of foods do not give dogs the protein they need. It gives them awful gas because they cannot digest the corn meal. There are much better food for dogs like Natural Balance and Merrick's Before Grain. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Learn to read ingredient labels before you buy.",0
My fish are very happy as long as I change them out on a regular basis.,1
I don't like how it will go off with any loud noise. If my other dog barks; the collar will go off on my one dog that we're trying to train to not bark so much.,0
No more durable than less expensive ones so save your coins and get the cheaper no name brand.,0
"Received these yesterday. There were literally 5 sticks in the package. I love my dog, but $5 per stick is something I am not willing to pay for his 20 minute enjoyment. Will be looking at other brands who actually state how many come in their package.",0
"I have to say, my first thought was ""I am spending HOW much for a litter box cabinet?"" and ""Surely it can't work as well as they claim..."" Well, all I can say is that after one week of using this cabinet, it was worth every penny, and it works as well if not BETTER than they claim. I am shocked. We have two cats, and in the past their litter box has always been in our laundry room. I didn't like it there - it was smelly, the cats left litter on the floor, we could never shut the laundry room door, etc. - but it was better than having that stinky thing out where everyone would have to endure it. We've used various powdered litter box deodorizers in the past, with modest success, but nothing really ever got rid of the smell.  Until THIS cabinet. It's a beautiful piece of furniture, it was hand-made so it was exactly the size and color we wanted, and it, no kidding, sits in the formal ENTRY to my house, where it functions as a delightful decorative bench. If you didn't know it held a cat box ... you'd never know it held a cat box! Even right after the cats do their business, there is no odor! Love, love, LOVE this product and wish I'd had it years ago!!!!!",1

"I completely agree with the other posters who stated the dangers of this ironically named bird ""safety"" leash. Decades ago, it took us years to get people to stop using leg chains on parrots - and now Marc Marrone and King's Cages want to bring them back. This is a very dangerous product that - like leg chains - will easily break legs.

To assume that equipment that works well w/ raptors is automatically great for parrots is fallacious. Birds of prey kill and carry prey w/ their legs - parrots do not. A parrot's leg is not designed to withstand the same stressors.",0
This works even on very small ticks. The insect has always come off intact also. I bought 6 and gave them to friends.,1
exelente producto monitoreo execto,1
"I only received one package to try on the cats but of the 5 cats we offered these treats to, only 3 were willing to try it and none were enthusiastic. It did not stink and the cats were not hostile to but obviously did not like it or thought that it was nothing special. Ultimately we offered this to eight cats including the feral cats  outside, it did get eaten ,by a cat that will eat anything including broccoli and bean sprouts but this is clearly not a hit . I am glad I only got one bag.",0
"These are magic!  My dog has suffered with arthritis in her hips for months, and nothing seemed to help -- I'd tried item after item from the pet store.  I saw these and decided to give them a try, and the change is amazing.  It took a couple of weeks, but then she started acting like her old self, jumping up to great us and trying to jump on the bed again (not quite, so she's using her stairs again).  These are worth every penny and more!",1
Excellent product!  Does the job!,1
"Just received product & it is being returned.  The non-sheepskin synthetic material is horribly thin and cheap. Pictures depict the backing showing thru on edges & middle of sling.  There is zero padding inside for stability; just two pieces of webbing with very harsh, scratchy, thin mat'l sewn around it; it will not hold up to a heavy dog's weight over time. The quality is not in this product to warrant this price. See the difference with the Gingerlead sling.  I'm astonished at the good reviews.  I wld not put this in the washer as they suggest.",0
Smells and works great!,1
I have to say that I love this bowl.  My dog was still a puppy when I got this.  She had a tendency to push bowls around with her nose or pick them up and move them around.  Neither of which could she do with this fabulous bowl!  The inside was slick and the outside barely had a lip so she couldn't pick it up.  The rubber on the bottom stopped her from moving it all over the place.  I couldn't be happier.  It fit exactly 1-1/2 cups of food in it.  It is not a huge bowl but it held exactly what we needed it to.,1
"Pictures very deceiving the dishes are very very small

Wolfe really likes these treats. He goes wild over them,1
Made for smaller cat litter boxes but does the job. Did not realize it was that small.,1
I expected these to last a bit longer... They were gone before we really got to play with them. He loved them while they lasted I guess.,0
These bows are fabulous. Full of glitz and glamor. Perfect for a limitless dog.,1
Our Chinchillas Chili and Pepper absolutely love this little hideaway!,1

"Looks metal in the photo, but this is a piece of plastic crap.  No way it will hold up, nor will it clean well, can't properly disinfect.  There is a reason these things are metal!  It is also not a ""large"" tray as advertized, compared to other scrapers/scoopers. Waste of money.  Do not buy.",0
"I would like to discredit the people saying that it only works on small dogs, I have a 55lb female blue nose am-staff and this collar works like a charm on her. The sensor must be secure tightly right where the jaw meets the neck. It needs to be tight enough that you can still get two fingers under the collar, but not tight enough to where the dog cant breathe. My dog has been using this for a few weeks, she loves when its on because she thinks its now a piece of her normal clothing. I call it her pretty red necklace and she doesn't squirm or walk away when I'm putting it on. In the short few weeks Ive had it shes has learned that if its on she shouldn't bark at other dogs. The problem now is when shes out of the collar - she still sits at the storm door and barks at other dogs walking past the house.

The manual falls short of explaining the product. The product description says it has 6 progressive correction levels. It doesn't clearly state that these settings are automatic, the collars correction ""shock"" is completely non-adjustable. It does let out a beep just prior to the shock so the dog can hear the audible warning. If the dog continues to bark the shock intensifies. After awhile the dog learns. Now when the first woof occurs she receives a mild correction and will typically walk away from the other dog she was fixated on. You'd be surprised how quick they learn.

Make sure the sensors are through your dogs coat and touching skin, dogs with a longer coat could create a muffled barrier between the prongs and the dogs vocal cords.

NOTE - Another dog(s) barking will NOT set this collar off. Anyone that says that is doing something wrong because it activates based on vibration.

Anytime I am about to put the collar on i rub the sensors on the counter or any rough surface to test its on. You will hear the beep, if you don't hear a beep the battery is probably bad or not seated properly.

The other part of the manual which I think is very poorly written is the part about the battery compartment. The battery door should be spun to the right-most arrow in order for the product to work. The manual says take the battery out when you first get it, completely unnecessary - just tighten the door.

For a dog with a strong personality I would say this is a great learning aid. Any bigger dog or bully breed that sort of does what they want will benefit from this. My dog likes to bark at other dogs, shes been through multiple training courses and she has a prong collar. To me this is much more humane than her choking herself with the leash. You cannot correct a dog once they are in flight mode - any dog behaviorist will tell you they go practically deaf and commands don't work. This quick correction is much less harsh on the dog than any leash correction can provide.

Also, the instructions say to remove the dogs tags from their collar or collar completely. I have a martingale collar made of nylon, once I take the tags off the collar is silent and I can have the bark collar on over the traditional collar so we can go on walks. The instructions say to remove all other collars, again not really true. The major concern is having anything else around the dogs neck that can jingle or vibrate to set off the bark collar (which is why the bark collar must be high and tight on the dogs neck - away from anything that will interfere with its operation.

Hope this helps some folks.",1
My cats LOVE them! I just ordered some more! I put these on their cat tree and they go wild and knock them off and all over the place! I didn't expect them to like it like they do!,1

"This is a piece of junk. The size and threading on the neck of the half-liter bottle make it incompatible with every other half-liter water bottle in the world -- WHY??? The neck's too narrow for the bottle to get clean in the dishwasher (not that it mentions dishwasher safety at all). The instructions consist of a vague little diagram showing how you ""snap"" the two pieces together, but it's flimsy at best. The cap has a rubber gasket instead of a lid, guaranteeing it will leak if not perfectly upright. The so-called belt clip is a cheap plastic hook, so the bottle would swing wildly from your hip.",0
"My medium size border terrier who is a regular chewer played with this toy for about 5 minutes before it was all ripped apart.  All KONG toys are typically high quality and durable, this is the first time I am disappointed with this brand.",0
"It's junk. I recommend you stay far away from it.

The sweeping head itself is jerky, noisy and gets debris in it very easily making the gear lock up so it can't sweep.

Worse yet is that the mounting design is terrible to the point of being idiotic. It's all thin, hard plastic and the actual powerhead portion of the unit fits less than tightly into the inlet/mounting base only about 1/4 inch. When it runs the powehead vibrates against the inlet and creates a loud,""rrrrrrrrrrr.....rrrrrrrrrrr.....rrrrrrrrrr...."" noise that will drive you up a wall. It doesn't shut up with time either. You can even put your hand anywhere on the tank and feel it. It probably drives the fish as crazy as it will drive you. You can hear this thing clean across the house, especially at night. I've been using one for close to a year and it's just as loud today as it was when it was brand new. I eventually had to put it on a timer so it would shut up at night and I don't take it out and smash it into little pieces.

This thing is LOUD and very stupidly designed.

I wouldn't buy any of these Zoo Med Powersweep units. They are all designed the same way and they are all complete failures.

Piece of JUNK!!",0
Beautiful sweater,1
These pills are huge I basically need to put it half way down my daschunds throat to get him to swallow it. As beneficial as it I really think you should try and make a smaller pill for smaller dogs,1

works great,1
the idea was great but unfortunately this item did not fit my cat. it fit her from head to tail but there was way too much fabric in the middle between her thighs so when she walked (or attempted to walk) she would end up with her hind leg in the wrap. I have tried Multiple incontinent items and I was REALLY Hoping this one would work. looks like its back to pee pads and locking her out of our room again :( . Very unsatisfied.,0

"Perfect for my needs, short hauls in the car inside a crate.",1
"This products sizing standards are a joke. The carrier I ordered was indicated as ""large"" and suitable for up to 22 lbs of pet. I received a carrier that I can't humanely stuff my 17 lb terrier into. I imagine this might carry a 22 lb frozen turkey or maybe 22 pounds of wet newspaper. All flippancy aside this carrier is suitable for at most a 10 or 12 pound animal. Be warned people.",0
"I bought this harness in large for my twenty pound 1 year old French Bulldog, and in medium for my 12 pound Papillon. They both fit fine, but there is very little extra room, but this dog is grown and maintaining the same weight for years, so no need for anything larger.
The large has plenty of room to grow, even considering how Frenchies are shaped. Mine is still growing and this ought to last.

They are nice looking and easy to put in, and seem well made. My dogs seem very comfortable in them; no scratching or chewing as they have done with other collars and harnesses. And they seem quite secure.

I am surprised to find also that the dogs did not pull at all in their walk. They are generally very good on leash, but excitable for the first few minutes, and , small as they are, can be a challenge until they simmer down. In these harnesses though, the leashes remained slack the whole trip. I have always thought manners were about training rather than tools, but this is an exception very happy with my purchase, and so are my dogs!",1
I have put it on her about 7 times and it never helped!!  I finally tried some anti- anxiety pills that did the job.,0
"Great ball. Great quality. It's some what heavy, not a good throw ball, but I put peanut butter in the hole for my American Bulldog and he loves it.",1
"My Viszla loves these, but at this price for a 3 oz bag that you can get through other sellers and at Walmart for less than half the price. I would give it 4 stars for the product, but really none for the price. At the time that I ordered, the shipping weight stated 1.3 oz and the product description stated 3 oz. I asked which it was and got conflicting replies. Now, the shipping weight states 5 oz, which I guess would be correct for a 3 oz product.",0
This is an excellent product for your cat to brush and groom themselves,1
"My 2 cats like playing with it, but there are 2  major flaws. First there is no timing mechanism, so once you turn it on it stays on until you manually turn it off. It needs to automatically turn off after 15-20 minutes because, leading to problem 2...it eats batteries like crazy. You'll get 3 play sessions at most per set of batteries. It takes 3 ""C"" cells.",0
Went by measurements and ended up being WAY too small around the neck!,0
"This carrier is perfect for my dog. I built a platform on the back of  my bike and attached this to it and my dog goes bike riding with me! He can look all around and is not cramped at all. I purchased a small at first but that was too big, so I ended up getting an extra small. My dog is a 10 pound Morkie and he has lots of room. This is the best carrier I have found!",1
"Poor Lhasa was in pain getting up after laying down for a while. Our vet recommended Flexadin Advanced. Been giving this to our dog for months. Jumps up and down like a puppy.  Great product, good price.",1
My cats refuse to eat this food. The chunks in it are too large for my small cat to ingest even if she did like the flavor.  Try at you own risk. I have a large unused box.,0
"I bought this specifically because I have a really big cat. He normally claws a shelf in the garage, and his marks go up to 40 inches. When I saw the picture of this scratching post, I immediately thought that the base looked too small for the height, but I figured there must be some trick, i.e. metal base plate or something to hold it up. There wasn't. Not only is the base wood, but it's in two pieces, attached with a couple of flimsy nails. The whole thing wobbles ridiculously. I ended up putting a heavy bookshelf on one corner to make it stand up to my cat's weight.

The other problem is that the ""irresistible sisal fabric"" proves to be of no particular interest to my cat. He scratched the thing dutifully a few times, but then went right back and whined at the garage door to get to his shelf. Waste of money on my part.",0
First issue was the size. It says for small breeds but the size indicates different. Def better suited for mid sized dogs like Beagles or Corgis. Way too big for a 10lb Yorkie. Second complaint is the bristle hardness. The bristles are very stiff and unforgiving. Toothbrush went right in the trash.,0
Too small.. 50 super worms last longer than 1100 tiny meal worms,0
"These are the worst quality pads I have seen to date. Even though they are a little cheaper than other brands, do yourself a favor and spend a few extra dollars.",0
"Roomy enough for three cockatiels. I love this cage but it's a pain to remove the bottom for cleaning. Oh well, it only happens once per week.",1
Didn't arrive in good shape. Half of it was yellowish and probably dead.,0
"I found out my new puppy had parvo and she was just starting to have symptoms. I bought Parvaid and Vibactra Plus because the sales person told me I have to get these combination. I followed directions, but she started to get worse and died.
Parvaid is not even FDA approved. I called the Manufacture and the retail store, but neither of them wanted to give me a refund. It's not money back guarantee because they know it doesn't work!
The store manager told me I should have had her treated at a vet because parvo is a serious disease that you can't treat it with a over the counter medication. They should have told me that in the first place and stopped me from buying them then.
I know that parvo is a serious disease but according to their website, Parvaid was supposed to be 90% effective(of course they would say that) and I believed it. Well, I was wrong.
I think those good reviews were written by the manufacturer or people who sell them. Don't believe them!
Don't buy these products! You will lose not only money but also your precious dog!",0
"I get these for my degus and rabbit. Even though the rabbit always has access to Timothy hay, he seems to prefer the cubes and goes crazy when offered one. These are also great for when we need to transport him as they're less messy than hay or pellets.",1
"My dog loves shirts, but this shirt seals the deal in my book. It's perfect! And i don't have to change it often because the design allows for him to pee without getting it on the shirt which means he doesnt have pee all over himself!  5 stars for that alone, lol. I'm going to buy another because it fits so well. Excellent product, thanks guys! I'll be back!",1
"Good toys as usual but didn't squeak at all...can't return as I cut the tags off and gave it to our dog before I knew, he was disappointed.",0
"Our greyhound has many ""studies"" but favors this still!",1
"Was almost able to use this a month with no problem. Noticed the water flowing out of it was getting rather low, decided to clean it, replaced the carbon pouch. Thing won't turn back on. Tried everything. I have two filters in my tank for situations like this, glad it's paying off. I'd suggest spending the extra money and buy a canister filter, if you do buy this, expect to upgrade quickly. Return policy gives you one day to return defective item, no replacement. Buy elsewhere.",0
"This is the finest vehicle dog crate we have ever seen.  We travel over 30,000 miles a year with out dogs.  They are always in crates or seatbelts.  Hence, we saw this first class crash tested crate a good investment.  I bit tricky to assemble because the instructions are drawings, and adjust for installation, but simply a fantastic product.  Only wish it had a plastic bottom pan.  Pricey but worth the money.  The large fits our 2015 Toyota RAV-4 perfectly.",1
"My 11-year old Rott has done so well with this product, she runs around like a puppy again! I highly recommend this item if your dog has arthritis issues- or even before your dog develops arthritis. (S)he may never have to know what arthritis is!

Won't be buying anything from Happy Dog Place again. I had these 2 balls less than 2 weeks. One broke and cut my dogs mouth and they refuse to take them back or give me a refund.,0
Perfect car seat for small dogs! I have a 9 pound Pomeranian and she absolutely loves this thing! She was always trying to jump up to see out of the window and then ended up falling all over the place. This is so much safer for her. We buckle her in with her harness and she absolutely loves is. There is plenty of room for her to curl up lay down and even have a bone i there with her.,1
Order about 3 sizes up.,0
"My dogs (13 year cocker, 13 year hound, and 8 year lab) love this ... and it works. Healthier skin, eyes, coat - and they seem to feel better - more playful.",1
These plants were awesome.  All in great shape when arrived.,1
"It may work well for some puppies, but our 4-month old goldendoodle threw up for the 3 consecutive days that we fed it to her.  We're going back to our previous food for her.",0
Can't wait until I get back the results. Thank you very much for such a great product and easy to read Instructions,1
My Husky didn't like these.,0
Great tug-o-war toys!,1
"My dog really loved this toy, but sadly she can't play with it anymore because it broke less than 24 hours of her getting it. Firstly, the reinforcement cones inside the ball came unglued one by one, each time jamming the motor unit. I spent much time interupting her play session, in order to take the ball apart to get each cone out, before reassembling it. All the while my poor dog looked on with great frustration. After all that, the motor was working but the ball would no longer move, so I had to jiggle it about myself (which rather defeats the object!) In the end, I had to put the ball away as I could smell the motor burning itself out. I'm angry considering that this toy wasn't cheap (plus the amount of shipping costs). It will be too much hassle for me to send it back to the U.S. to get a replacement.",0
"i started this in march and i hate it to death. this has been the most disgusting experience i've ever had to endure. i seriously want my money back.

not only are the discs hard to clean due to pee getting in between the disc and the potty seat that goes on the toilet... but the discs aren't deep enough so the cats end up kicking litter all over the place.. which means litter is all over the bathroom floor and being tracked all over the house, i cant even keep my bath mats on the bathroom floor and i have to always make sure i'm wearing sneakers or slippers when i enter the bathroom.

at first it seemed like my cats were going to be successfully potty trained... but when i moved to the orange disc, they only went on the potty once in a while. so i kept putting them on the seat and it seemed like they were back in the habit of using the potty again. eventually i moved on the the green disc and both cats have completely STOPPED COLD FREAKIN TURKEY... which means my house STINKS to high hell because they are peeing and pooping all over the damn place!

i keep putting them on the potty, but they refuse. i'm thinking the holes are too big and maybe they're afraid of the water. i'm actually cleaning up more poop now than when i had a litter box... which i'm going to have to buy later today because this is just ridiculous. i hate this product. if i could give it ZERO stars, i would",0
"This collar is very sturdy and is a safety collar.  The lace and flowers are dainty looking, but sturdy.  My cat is rough on collars and this has held up well.  She is a big boned strong 14 pound cat & most people think she is a boy.  Now there is no confusion.  I certainly recommend this product.",1
"It's a medium light for a standard 10g tank + glass versa top, considering the growth and color of my plants.

Running DIY CO2 @ 1 bps and everything is growing fast.  If you want a high led light for a 10g, you should go for the Fugeray 2 or BML.

In medium light running some DIY CO2 for about 20 dollars helps with any algae problems and it's rather simple.",1
Very dangerous.  Birds get their feet caught in the nylon stitching.,0
This is a great kennel for traveling.  Lightweight and easy to move from car to house.  My dog loves it.,1
size wasn't accurate - I had to return,0
"I would think that a big name Pet company could make a reliable cat feeder, but not this one. Easy to program, but on the first dispensing of food, 3 kernels rolled out, and our cat and I just looked at one another. On the second feeding, 8 kernels rolled out. Once again in disbelief, our cat and I just steered at another. I could see in her eyes that this simply did not look promising, and there was no way we were going out of town without something more dependable. It was supposed to be a 1/4 cup. After those two irregular feedings it seemed to work, or at least I thought so. Our cat can develop a real attitude if she isn't fed on time and if she isn't fed her accustomed portion. I would come home after the scheduled feeding times, and be greeted by a vocal cat with an attitude. I found myself taking food out of the hopper and feeding her. I couldn't depend on it to dispense the correct portion of food, or any food for that matter. The feeder lost all credibility with us. I soon went on the hunt for another feeder after a couple of months.",0
This is a great cage.  easy to put together.  Have had it for 3 months now and easy to clean.  with two doors... makes it easy to get bird.,1
"There from China. Only reason I looked was because my dog threw up.
Thats pretty much the only time he does.",0
Literally within 10 minutes my dog chewed one of the legs off.,0
"MY CATS LOVE THESE THINGS........BUT THEY DO NOT LAST VERY LONG....AFTER A FEW DAYS OF PLAY THE RED BALL FALLS OFF AND MY CAT EATS THE FEATHERS, BUT STILL A FUN TOY....THANK YOU",1
This replacement cover rejuvenated the dog's bed.  He is much happier not sleeping on sagging cover that let him sink onto the cold cement!,1
My Corgi thinks these are the best toys ever.,1
Our 6 month old puppy loved his bone but didn't even last a week for him and that with the large one. It smelled like vanilla out the package but once he started chewing on it gave off a awful odor.,0
"This harness does not work that well and I did not purchase it for our 2nd Lab.  How it's supposed to work doesn't and just pulls off to the side instead.  I have the gentle leader now for both of my Labs I use when talking them for walks, it didn't take long for my 6.5 yr old to become comfortable with the gentle leader, my 1.5 yr old had had one since he was old enough to use it on him.",0
the price is right!,1
"However, my cat is 10 yrs old. Does still play and is always curious but made no attempts to retrieve her treats.
It is well built and arrived packaged perfectly. I'm in the process of returning it.",0
It's so cute,1
"Love this product. Totally glad I purchase it! Considering buying another one.  Perfect for use in the kennel. It is kind of thin in the middle like the other reviewers said, but I did what they did & put the dog blanket on top.",1
My cats wouldn't eat food with it in it,0
Worked Great!,1
Fast shipping good price couldn't be happier,1
do not se any progress in 4 washes,0
My small chickens loved this treat square.  They pecked it apart in no time.,1
"Cat loves it. It's fairly quiet motor, and the self play aspect can't be beat.",1
"Arrived in about 9 pieces, very disappointing",0
"I love this carrier!  The wheels and easily extractable handle makes the trip to the vet much easier.  It's very roomy, holds up to a 25 lb. pet and the heavy netting all around keeps the pet safely in but allows them to see out.  Only problem I could see would be with a ""chewer"" or ""clawer"".  The back and bottom are rigid but the sides and front are soft sided, making it a little awkward to lift in and out of a car but not bad.",1
"Within a few days of use, the lens fell off making the light unsafe to use. Never had that happen before.",0
Nice and strong.,1
"The filling falls out as a whole by itself. Its a jelly like soft, rubbery filling. Not what I expected.",0
"This thing is junk. I bought it for my dog to help him stop barking at all times of the day and night. I followed all instructions to a T as far as installing batteries, charging and pairing the remote. the unit took longer than they said to charge completely (about 8 hours).  As soon as I paired the remote I tested it. The Vibrate and noise worked fine, but as soon as I put the included tester for the shock on it and pushed the button the light on the tester flashed very quickly and the entire unit went black.  I tried turning it back on with no luck. I tried resetting it by plugging it back in, also no luck. The entire unit died after one test, it makes me wonder what it would have done if I had put it on my poor dog before tesing it.  Luckily I am able to return it to amazon. I will just go to PetSmart and get a different one with less inconvenience if I need to make another return.",0
I have had this exact product before. What I got was bouillon cubes. Chicken flavored my tush! It was crumbly and huge.  I was afraid to give it to my pet.,0
"This is way too small for my dog. She's about two feet long and weighs 47 pounds. If she lies sideways half of her is off the bed. Don't go by weight, but add length/width much larger than your dog. Also, to call it ""bolstered"" is really stretching the meaning of that word; the bolsters are very short. I'm returning it.",0
"great, but bring back the four step please.",1
Excellent product!! I will not use any other brand from my Great Dane.,1
"My dog is quite small, and these are maybe to big for her.  She is interested sometimes, but not often, and not for long.",0
"Tried product because of lower cost, however, not as absorbent as ""Al-absorb Extra Large Training Pads.",0
This dog leash does not retract as expected and gets stuck when pulled out at times.,0
"I thought these would be their favorite toy because they have other glitter balls and homemade yarn balls they absolutely love, but sadly they don't seem to play with these as much as the others.  I'm not sure if the material they're made from is different and they don't like it or what the difference might be. They look the same as glitter balls I've purchased from pet stores.",1
batteries would not stay in because of weak springs,0
Vet said to not use these. It could give dogs infections.,0
I am very pleased with the quality of this product. Both of my dogs took to it right away. It is sturdy and very functional.,1
This litter is good for odor control but other than that I was not impressed. It stuck to the surface of the littler box where my kitty pees. I'll stick to Tidy Cats light weight.,0
works great,1
Great packing and very fluffy and supportive. It unwashable insides if your pet urinates on it. (Cover is washable but insides will shred and you'll have a washer full of foam.),0
"This product did not live up to my expectations and was sorely overpriced!  If you want a nutritional supplement for your pet, I advise you get a recommendation from the vet prior to purchasing anything.",0
"My dog didn't like it, so haven't used it at all.",0
"My cat has  a severe hairball problem and I give her 10 treats daily for years. I have always bought the smaller size bags, but this time I bought these 6.3 oz. size and she will have nothing to do with them, Something has changed. I will try the smaller size bags again and see what happens.
These are not the same as before.",0
Too narrow for my elderly dog to feel comfortable.,0
"12lb dog.  Fits but to wear in the front and try to ride, dog sinks down too far and would bottom feet would scratch bike.  very uncomfortable to wear and I don't think I would trust it as Velcro came undone and even though zipper would hold I can't trust my pup to be safe.  It would be ok if using for walking and standing up but was surprised how heavy 12'lbs felt and how far down it would hang even though straps were as tight as possible.",0
My two rescue furballs LOVE these.,1
"It was too small for our Rav 4....the last fabric one we had was larger to give them a flat surface to sit....resulted in dog jumping into front seat. Also, too slick...he slid across the back seat. Thank you for offering a potential solution to our needs....but we are returning.",0
"I've been purchasing this product for a while with many varied results.  Sometimes we get really great hay, and other times we get random things in the boxes - once it was a very large feather.  Another time, it was pieces of wood - looked like someone cut up a branch and threw it in there.  Sometimes it's straw or really hard, almost inedible pieces of straw or hay.  And most recently it was thorns, lots and lots of thorns!  We are feeding this to rabbits, and we cannot risk them eating thorns!  Not to mention that just reaching my hand in the box, I was stuck more times than I can count.  This is supposed to be hand sorted!  If I hand sorted half of the boxes I have received, I could tell you that they haven't been checked well.  I have complained to Standlee about the problems in the past, and they do nothing.  They don't care.  While Oxbow is expensive, at least they care.  They will instantly replace any of their product that isn't right.  So, we have switched back over, and I'm done with this product.  Amazon told me they have pulled it for now because there are too many issues, but they are selling the same product in 5lb and 25lb packages!  Unless someone changes the quality control process, nothing will change.  Might as well go ahead and switch to something else permanently.",0
Received to day. Got it on my female hound mix. First time out in it. Not only did she get out of. The seems tore. Not worth it at all. So disappointed in this harness,0
This box is pretty big and holds a lot of litter which is nice for my diabetic cat. I ageee that the sticker on the inside is really annoying to get off.,1
"This is too complicated for my dogs, they won't go near it. They're only 10 and 12 lbs and they love the regular Busy Buddy but this one was a no go with them.",0
"Super thin, I have a very large dog which is why I wanted a large dog bed. The mattress is so thin I had to keep my other bed to go under it so she had cushion.",0
Cheap toy.. It only lasted a few weeks until it started getting really slow and wouldn't properly work.,0
"My dogs love this food, my big boy layed on the bag of food all the way home. My females ears are much better since we switched to taste of the wild. Thank you!!",1
"A lot of people are leaving negative comments & not taking simple measures to make this cat tree stable with L brackets.  I love me some L brackets, laws yes!  The unit comes with the most rudimentary instructions, if you can call it that & their topper is lame, however if you use L brackets & screw it into the wall, this thing is a BEAST & holds up wonderfully with even our 22 lb monster cat, Choochamongous!  We have 2 brothers that are a year & a half old that love to race each other up the tree to see who wins the top platform & they will also launch themselves off the top, doing what we call the Jimmy Snooka flying leap.  With a little TLC & inventiveness, the Santander by Trixie is a great, low cost cat tree/tower.  The down side to the unit is the supposedly ""adjustable"" top is awful.  The furry thing hides nothing more than a threaded rod with a wood circle.  The rod we got was bent & being that our ceilings are just 8 feet high, we were able to discard that top piece & wedge a piece of wood, about 1/2 inch thick, as a  sort of shim.  If you have the standard 8 foot ceiling, I'd copy what we did & use L brackets on the hidey-hole & platforms/shelves to anchor it so that it will hold up much longer than if you were to rely on that silly rod.",1
"All I am going to say is that if I wanted to purchase this system I would not do it. Amazon refunded my purchase and I bought another brand for over $100.00 more then the LiquaGen costs. Everything went well on the second purchase installation.
LiquaGen support is very good. Fast response to emails and knows the system very well.
The rest is all downhill.
Its possible I just managed to receive the 1 in a 1,000 that was going to have several problems.",0
great price. quality product,1
Received a used one. Broken flashlight that got burning hot. Bags are much to thin. Extremely disappointed. I gave it two stars because with different bags I put holes in it seems to be decent. Will now have to find a flashlight that fits. Definitely not worth over 20$.,0
"This is like Filet Mignon to my cats. They go crazy when they hear me pull the box out of the cabinet. I can't leave the box out in the open because the younger cat has figured out how to open the top! ;)  If I'm trying to lure them out of their hiding places, I just rattle  the box and ""POOF""! They both magically appear!",1
"The idea of this muzzle was good, but the execution is poor. It has a strip of elastic that connects the strap that goes around the neck to the strap that goes around the snout. It is very stretchy, so our dog was able to maneuver the strap off her nose in under 30 seconds. Unfortunately it just doesn't do the job it needs to.",0
My baby loves to carry this around! He doesn't chew on it but loves to play fetch and tug of war and has held up for 2 months.,1
"The jacket is sturdy and covers my dog well, is waterproof plus the fleece lining provides some warmth.",1
Xs were way to big on all 3 of my dogs all from 6-12 pounds. Didn't fit any of them. They all slipped out;(,0
"Not grain free, so my kittens'  gas problem got worse. They did get better when switching to another food, grain free.",0
Good for large dogs,1
This was not a good harness. If it was meant for not pulling its garbage. The first time I took my dog out it began to rip and twisted her. I recommend the gentle leader instead because this truly was a waste.,0
Does the trick to transport a cat to the Vet who refuses to get into the cage.  Enough zippers so it's easy to force her in it,1
Tried this on a recommendation of a friend. Does a fantastic job and does not dry out my dog's skin,1
It's fine,1
fits my yorkie poo perfectly its a gr3eat fall vest and has a hole for leash to go through.,1
works good,1
The filter works ok but gets noisy unless the bowl is completely full.  Even if it is down 25% the pump starts to click and make a lot of noise.  Very annoying.,0
This little tool is a lifesaver. I was recommended to buy one of these from a friend and I was amazed mostly by how easy it is to use and to clean. Once you get a lot of hair you just push the button on the back and all of the hair easily comes off in one clump. I would highly recommend this product to any shedding dog owner. Plus the nice thing is it is much much cheaper if you buy it in Amazon.,1
Very disapointing. Does not hold air,0
It is cute but TOO SMALL for my one cat! It is meant for a very small kitten-not a cat. It is really cutel. I do have a 13 week old kitten and she just fits on it....she won't fit it in next week so it has to go back,0
"The Kong carrot is by far my cats' favorite toy.  It has enough weight that I can throw it across the room, but is also very soft.  The feathers and catnip pouch are also a nice touch that helps keep their interest.  He loves to fetch it and wrestle with it. My other cat likes to chew the feathers, so we've gone through a few now, but it gets played with so much it is worth it--and they last a lot longer if I monitor their play and keep it out of reach when I can't be there to watch.",1
Product worked great for a week then wouldn't charge,0
Outstanding  !!  Amazon does a good job  too,1
The pad was constructed nice and was put together well. My dogs tended to chew on it which lead to green stuff that is worse than stuffed animal insides to clean up. In the end my puppies used it as a mat under their sleeping pad never using it once for a place to potty. If I wanted I probably could have trained them better but decided they are old enough now (almost 4 months) to tell me when they need to go out. If you dog is a chewer be careful they don't choke on this pad.,1
This bed is awesome! I'm so glad I splurged on it and no longer have to keep buying beds my dogs will destroy within a day. I expect this one to last at least as long as my dogs are alive. I bought the biggest one so my puppy bloodhound could grow into it and there's still be room for my dachshund to snuggle with her on it. It's so easy to clean and is very attractive.,1
"I am very surprised to not see more positive reviews. I started using on my 2 yr old cat, he never really minded although initially my husband held him. He quickly realized this will not hurt him. I disagree w the orher reviewer i run it continuously until we're done. It absolutely stays cool. Now my 9 yr 7 lb maltese did not like at first finally gave in bc i pedi paw the cat. In the ebs this is better as ive occasionally clipped her quick and she bled a bit. The key is once they know it will never hurt them and possibly familiarization. To the point of larger dog owners --- may be less practical. Consider what it is please. Would you use a nail file on them?! If they have thick, longer nails probably better to clip down first then get closer w this. Also the nails conform w regular use. This is such a Godsend for me as i can keep my cats nails very short. He does not purposely scratch or destroy furniture but this way nothing is ever damaged accidentally.  Used for 2 years.  Have repurchased replacement heads.  Totally satisfied.",1
"So two of the squirrels lasted for (drum roll please)................ 5 minutes tops. Wow I was frustrated. I thought the squirrels were stuck inside the tree and when the dog went to grab them they retreated inside. Instead, the squirrels come out and can be completely chewed. One squirrel got lost under the couch so it lasted for awhile. The tree itself was more fun for the dog as it was bigger. The tree lasted for 3 weeks before the stuffing started flying out. Boooo this toy! I would have given this product 1 star if the tree did not last for 3 weeks. The dog actually got some entertainment out of that.",0
"I bought three of these...NO GOOD...the first time the cat decided to jump up on top of this the frame broke and there is no way to put it back together.  After loosing all three of these to the cats jumping up I gave up.
The frame is a joke.",0
Arrived in good condition.  Good product.,1
It's OK for the price. The directions could have been easier to read. Hard to tell what size bolt goes where? Relatively easy to put together. Time will tell with Richard ( 22 pounder) if it will hold up. I suggest if your cat isn't a graceful jumper make sure you choose the ladder model.,1
"NO birds like all that Millet! They didn't like it in Illinois, and the South Carolina birds don't like it either. Neither do the squirrels..hmm",0
Worked for almost a month. Then she started peeing outside the box again. It has been 5 months total since using the feliway and the behavior hasn't stopped.

"While playing with this ball, my dog was able to break through what  is suppose to be durable vinyl that's safe for pets .  She started gagging and choking. After taking and observing the ball I noted that one of the holes used to grip the ball was torn and jagged.  She had swallowed pieces of the vinyl and was choking.  This product is not safe for pets.  My dog is a female 14lb yorkie mix.  Imagine what a 25lb or over dog would do with this ball.  She love this ball, the sounds excite her.  I had to fight with her to get it, but I have to send it back due to the unsafe use of this ball.  The vet bill far exceeds the price of the ball and her life is more important.  So purchase at your own risk.  I can only rate based on a ball I purchased from this company.",0

"I must say My Dog loved it he spend most of winter hours inside  his House,
Great Product
thank you",1
"Very disappointed. This did not help my cat at all. I used as directed, and after 2 weeks, there was no improvement at all. In fact, she was MORE congested. And although this cat has previously been very patient about taking does of prednilsone, azithromycin, and doxycycline, she really HATED this stuff and fussed a lot about taking it, so I'm guessing it tastes terrible to cats.",0
"Perfect!

We've tried out more dog beds than I should even admit & I must say these are our favorites so far. So cozy. They absolutely love it.",1
it really is good but not for my yorkie. works better for the blue heeler.,1

"My Mother puchased this garbage for my Yorkie. I never EVER give him these types of treats. My Yorkie only eats gourmet treats. Any way last evening I gave him a small piece of this shortly thereafter, he bagan vomitting, and falling over appeared to have had a SEIZURE!!!!! I was horrified as I looked on!!! He was helpless. Our poor little baby became so sick for over 30 minutes. I contacted Delmonte Foods, maker of this garbage. I was told they have not had any complaints of this nature, really? I did not find that possible at all. There was no other changes in his diet last night besides this! Our dog is perfectly fine now thank God, but I would not encourage any person to putchase these treats.

"Directly out of the box this gate system was poorly made. However, it's not as if the entire gate system was made poorly. In fact, the gate system is really good. The problem, however, is that the hinge in which the gate pivots on had barely any weld. The hinge is simply a small metal bar welded in place on both side of the gate. However, in the case with my system, the hinge had almost no weld on one side of the gate, and slight more on the other side. The first weld broke within 24 hours (It barely existed in the first place). The side weld, on the other side of the hinge, lasted about 2 weeks, when you consider that the gate isn't used everyday. And, so now, there exist not swing gate, as there simply exists a large hole on the fence system, from where there once was a gate section that opened. I will attempted to see if perhaps I can get just the one section (the section with the swing gate) from Amazon, but I'm not holding my breath. In conclusion, I cannot tell if others have received poor craftsmanship or if it was just me. I would like to think I just received a fluke, but beware, in the event the company has a high rate of failed weldings.",0
"I'm not sure if I got a defective one or what, but I feel this was a complete waste of money.  The range is awful and it beeps completely at random. Then it may suddenly start vibrating and won't stop until you plug it in.  My poor dog had no idea what was going on.  Stick with the Petsafe brand, folks.",0
"We have two female chinchillas at home and decided to purchase the Ferret Nation 142. Wow. What a great cage.
I would have given this 5 stars, but there are a couple of drawbacks.
The assembly instructions are difficult to follow, you need to look at the pictures carefully and figure out how the pieces fit together. Also, the hooks at the end of some of the ramps must be bent to properly hook into place. One of the shelf hooks was also bent out of shape, but I attribute that to a manufacturing defect or maybe a problem in shipping somewhere along the line. The end caps are also very hard to put in. (The end caps are used to cover the openings at the top of the side rails, which would otherwise allow you to purchase an optional third level, to make this cage even larger.)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midwest-143-Ferret-Nation-Add-On-Ferret-Cage-Level-with-Ramps/dp/B000F4SNNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midwest 143 Ferret Nation Add-On Ferret-Cage Level with Ramps</a>
The quality is excellent. I also like that the metal is dark grey in color. (Previously, we had a white cage and that made it difficult to see through.)
There are ramps to allow your pets to easily climb to the shelves and between levels, although they seem to prefer to jump. I like the fact that the ramp between the two main levels can be hooked in a horizontal position to prevent an animal from going between. This is fantastic to separate our chinchillas when they decide to fight over something (usually dominance.)
When assembled the cage is about 5 1/2 feet tall, sitting on casters. It is very easy to move around and takes up a lot less floor space than I thought it would. Now we can actually move around in our living room.
The bottom shelf is great for storage and you can place another pan on top of the cage for additional storage space, if you choose not to purchase an expansion level.
The chins love the ramps. Fortunately for them they are large chinchillas. Smaller rodents may have problems with the spacing of the rungs on the ramps as they are not solid ramps. Tiny feet could get caught and that could be a problem, especially if a pet panics. The same problem exists with the edge of the included shelves. If you feel the gaps are too wide, I would suggest covering them with fabric.
The doors to the cage require at least two fingers to open. (Pinch two levers together.) It will take some getting used to, but at least you can be assured that when properly closed, your pets will NOT be able to get out on their own.
You can buy an optional ramp,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midwest-Ferret-Nation-Exterior-Ramp/dp/B0012GPZXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midwest Ferret Nation Exterior Ramp</a>&nbsp;if you want to allow your pets to roam freely and re-enter the cage on their own.
As I said, our chinchillas are large enough that they can fully enjoy the ramps and the shelves. They also appreciate the ability to sit and look out to see what's going on outside their protected environment. They love watching television and they are very comfortable doing so.
This cage is a bit expensive, but I think worth the price. We love it and our chins do too. Overall, an excellent product.",1
"Not reliable, especially if you might have to rely on the manual feeder using the app.  I bought it for a stray / outdoor car to feed him while away from home.  Unfortunately,  raccoons come around in the evening and eat his food.  I need to be able to see what is going on (using the built in camera) and dispense food as needed.
Not going to happen with this unit.  The initial setup was easy.  Programming worked and I was able to use the app for manual food dispensing.  The problem is when the feeder looses power or gets turned off.  Once that happened, I could not re-connect to the feeder via app.  The company website says to delete / re-install the app.  Took me over an hour to re-configure the app as it was not working and after all that, all the pet data and programs had to be re-done.  Afterwards I moved the feeder to it's desired spot outside and while doing it, I lost power to the feeder and lost all the programmed data / feeding times.

I submitted a customer request via the company website and sent 2 emails to them requesting assistance, but no response.

Need to find a more reliable feeder.",0
My dog's breath is 80% improved.,1
I like the fact that it is made out of good protein and ingredients that I can understand. So it seems healthy to me. My dog has been eating this stuff for over 2 years with no issues and she likes it.,1
I have bought several of these over the past few years and they seem to have a shorter life span each time. This last one only lasted about a week before it broke and the head of the bulb completely came off of the base. I guess it's time to find another brand.,0

My granddaughter's pet rat loves his new cage.  The only complaint would be is he can take the food bowl out and spills it.  Would be better to have it less easy for rat to remove:),1
You all want me to write a review well here it is. I spent nearly $400.00 on a cage that was dented up and hard to fix not to mention the fact there was no directions and it took me three hours to put it together.,0
It was more dry than what I purchase in the store. Didn't seem as fresh. The ones from our local store are more fragrant and appealing to my guineas.,0

For outside animals you can't beat this.  I had been getting up every 3 to 4 hours to turn the heating pad back on for my elderly outdoor cat.  This allowed me to sleep again and keep my little old lady cat warm through the winter months.,1

"Not perfect, of course. Nothing ever is. There is still some dust and there are still a few broken-up clumps. But, over the last 19 years (our first cat still going strong at this age and with a few additional cats since) we have had experience with innumerable other brands--from clay to pine to corn to paper etc. Except for the original charcoal activated EverClean (no longer produced, no matter what the new box says), this is just about the best. One thing we would love the company to pay attention to is the fact that about two out of every five come to us with the bag broken and if you are not paying attention, makes a mess when you take it out of the delivery box. They need to improve the packaging. Otherwise, we recommend this product.",1

Its a nice playpen but my dog ripped through the zipper doors in no time at all.,0
"Works great, it covers the seats on my SUV perfectly and the kids can still sit in back with the puppy without needing to remove the cover. Waterproof is great as both the kids and puppy drag the snow in to the car and the seats don't get soaked from it, I just use a small washcloth to soak up whatever water collects there. I just wish it would cover the top of the seats too as the puppy likes to look out the windows which means he puts his paws on the top of the seats where the cover doesn't reach, but I haven't seen any covers that do that either.",1

"On the first use the seam at the top of the small end opening separated, so that my dog eventually could put his whole head through and escape. He is only 9.5 lbs and is 14 years old. He did not scratch, bite, claw or thrash. All he did was push his nose against it. The dimensions and flexibility were perfect for the underseat space on our Delta flight, but I had to hold the one seam together with what I had on hand in my purse - Band-Aids and safety pins! I would like to contact the seller or manufacturer to get a replacement. I like the carrier, but this is obviously a manufacturing defect. My review could change if I get a better made version of this product.",0

"I'm so glad I finally made my purchase for the Groom Ninja for my dog! I tried it immediately when it arrived and with just some casual brushing I managed to pull out a good amount of loose hair and dander from my Husky/lab. She enjoyed the brushing and even wanted belly brushes. I was impressed at how gentle it was for her. We had another brush, but she was sensitive to the bristles. Thank you, Groom Ninja.

I do have one suggestion, the brush fits awkwardly in the hand, it may be helpful to add foam padding or choose a more ergonomic shape. I got the medium size, but I have smaller hands.",1
"I bought this to keep my cats out of my mothers bedroom at night. I have two cats, the first being a six year old and the other is one year old. They like to gallop through the house, go for a high-speed chase in my mothers en suite bathtub, and walk all over her at night, so I figured this would be the perfect solution.

I set up the ScatMat at the doorway and turned it on after consulting the manual. I tested it on highit didn't hurt any more than zapping yourself with static on metal in the winter. I figured once the cats stepped on it once that we could just leave it in the doorway without it necessarily being activated.

The younger cat investigated first. Instantly he looked like he was dancing on a hot skillet and he took off running and hidnot something my normally outgoing kitty would usually do. The older cat, who had watched this happen, walked up to the mat and casually jumped over it. Bust for that one.

It did successfully keep the younger cat out of the room but at a cost. My normally loving, playful, extremely outgoing cat now has it in his head that there is an invisible patch of carpet living in his house with the intention of hurting him. Hes hiding much, much more, and keeps a wary eye on the mat even if hes got half a room between himself and it. He didn't seem convinced of safety even when the mat was picked up. Hes been less social too and is constantly vigilant of the evil mat that might sneak up on him at any moment. I feel awful about it; he now seems to think that his home is a very scary place.

The big problem was that my mother, who is in her 60s, slipped on the mat and almost took a fall that could have seriously injured her due to her age. The ScatMat has no significant grip on it keeping it from sliding all over the floor and could pose a safety risk for seniors. That being said, the mat does work for some cats, but it may prove to be very upsetting for them. Ill be returning this one, but even though Ive picked the mat up my cat still seems convinced that its lying in wait to get him when he least expects it.",0
At first my dog listened to the sound and stopped barking. But soon she got used to the sound and started ignoring it.,0

"I ordered the Pet Naturals Hip and Joint pills "" Extra Strength"" however what I received was a smaller bottle that did not display extra strength on the front. We had purchased one from another seller and the ingredients are also different. We live abroad and ordered these to a friend to bring over. Very dissapointed in this purchase as my two English Cocker Spaniels rely on these pills. The picture shown is the sticker they put on they back saying it was extra strength although the front bottle and ingredients say otherwise",0

It actually made the urine smell 10x worse.

"My senior, finicky Maine Coon cat absolutely loves this stuff.  He has been battling a few illnesses the last few years, and lost a dangerous amount of weight quickly when he stopped eating as usual.  To ensure he eats enough every day, I always keep this dried lamb tripe on hand.  Sometimes it is his entire meal.  Other times, a light sprinkle of these dried pieces over fresh / canned / raw food, or even a few chunks all on their own, with or without rehydrating, have perked up his appetite.  He eats this 100% of the time.  The smell is potent, no doubt, but I think that actually helps make it appealing for my dear old kitty whose weight is finally increasing again. Highly recommended.",1

Its lots of innovative features that I didn't find on other collars during my research, but after awhile I realized that it would shock my dog at random when he was not barking.

Great product. Looks nice. Cats loved it instantly. You would never know it's a litter box. Assembly was easy. Color was true to description. Decided not to use the drawer during assembly to give cats more height when using the box. Overall very satisfied.,1
"My dog loves his squeaky rubber dinosaur.  It was damaged and I couldn't find a replacement.  First off, the squeaker on this toy is VERY ANNOYING - a long, agonizing squeal.  The noise appealed to my dog, and he played with it for 30 min, then promptly threw up.  We thought he was just excited from playing with a new toy, but the next time he played with it, he ended up vomiting a number of times.  We've never had this problem with a toy before.",0
Waaaayyy too small!!  Donated it to Goodwill.,0
my dog loves this,1
great healthy snack for my dog.  She loves them.,1
Poor quality. We had the bells up for a week and the bells fell off with minimal tugging from my puppy. Not worth the buy.,0
Great deal on good dog food.,0
"Broke the third time I used it.  It looked used when I received it and the emory wheel was out of round when I received it.  Appeared to be a Pedia Paws clone, since my previous Pedia Paws grinder appeared to be more sturdy and took a different grinding wheel.  It was an Add On Item, so it wasn't worth returning or the fuss.  Just wish it was a real Pedia Paws Nail grinder.",0
"False advertising. I recieved a total of 12 plants/ bundles. 5 of them had stablished roots, the rest were bundles of what we trim from our plants. No roots whatsoever and many looked like thwy should be thrown away right out of the box. If you count all the individual stems in bundles that were cut off the main branch right before shipping ( no roots, not even a tiny one), you may get a count of 50.
 With your money,  go to the local pet store and choose the best plants you see with most stablished roots and come out a head.",0
"The product was exactly as described by the seller and delivered on time.  This cat litter trapping mat is larger than most in stores and much cheaper.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a cat that tracks annoying litter out of the box, this will solve your problems.",1
"I have an 8 month old kitten who is VERY playful and loves to scratch but wouldn't use fabric, cord, vertical or fully horizontal scratchers. As soon as I opened this one she began to scratch and play and roll all over it! The angled style is great and i didn't realize it when i ordered but there's also a crinkle toy hanging on the inside that she can paw at through the holes. Definitely will be purchasing again. Also, i selected free shipping and my order was supposed to come in as few shipments as possible, but this was sent separate from the rest of my order and arrived much sooner at no extra cost to me which was great.",1
Dog still won't touch it on his own yet but continue ringing it and saying 'potty outside' everytime he goes out.,1
I love it. Finally a litter that makes me happy.  Good odor control. The cats (2) like it. AND -  no dust.  Oh thank you god of litter.,1
What a waste of my time ordering this. This is only large if you're buying it for a Chawawa! I couldn't believe how small it was. It was like a sauce dish for my German Shepherd. I had to send it back and then order something else.,0
"This is a pretty good doggy bed, and especially for the price. My dog especially loves the ""bumpers"" on the surround, which she uses as a pillow. I actually own the Precision Crate that is one size up from this bed size, but I wanted to allow for some extra room in the crate for her food/water bowls (feeding her in the crate was one way I used to get her more comfortable with being in the crate). This bed is the perfect size exactly for that - there is just enough room for both the bed and the food/water bowls. Now that I don't use the crate very much anymore, I took the bed out, and she still likes sleeping on it, often preferring it to the bed or couch.

I did expect that the base of the bed would have had more padding, though; it is much thinner than I would have thought. But it did make it easy to roll up and pack when I take her on trips, though... and easily machine washable, as well.",1
My babies love it.,1
This thing is JUNK..  doesn't even phase my dog ..  its like shes not even wearing it..  Don't bother it won't work.,0
"This product is not 6 doses - it is 3.  There is nothing obvious to let you know, although it is stated down in the details.  Because they gouge you for the 6-month price, it is easy to assume it is the 6-month product.  It is not.",0
"My cat was tired of the stil water and would want to drink from my dogs water. So I purchased this in hopes of her drinking it! Nope, she didn't drink it, didn't even touch it! So I let it sit there for a week just in case she would touch it. A couple days ago I unplugged it and was about to clean it when I noticed mold. AFTER TWO WEEKS!!! Not even a month yet! Needless to say I was very disappointed with this!",0
"This natural balance product is greatly appreciated by our small chihuahua and she seems to be thriving on it. As you know, puppies need a different dog food in order to develop well, so it was especially nice to have the chance to try this one out.",1
"I bought this product hoping it would help me and my puppy problems but it did the opposite, i sprayed this out on the lawn and i don't know why but my puppy runs away from the scent!??",0
"I have two Great Danes - 140 lbs and 185lbs. They both loved this food at first - they would get really excited when they heard me getting their meal ready. About the third bag in, they lost interest and went on a hunger strike for 4 days. I noticed that it firmed up one of my dog's stools, however she was audibly gassy. My other dog didn't appear to have many issues with the food other than occasional gas - until he bloated and ended up with gastric torsion as well. The dogs had been on this food for about 5 months when this occurred. Luckily, I was home when it happened and knew the signs so rushed him to the animal hospital. I take all of the preventative measures against bloat and of course no one truly knows what causes it. I personally feel this food had a lot to do with the bloat that my boy experienced. I'm not saying it is the reason he bloated but I believe it was a factor. When they performed his surgery his belly was full of this food. I have since discarded the bag and I'm looking for a new food for them. I also noticed inconsistencies between bags - some have large kibble and others have smaller rounds - very strange!",0
Not worth it,0
"I connected this up to the intake and it never stays on. While starting up the filter, the bottom part falls into the tank and then the ball floats away!! After shutting the filter off three times and reconnecting it back together, every time it fell off, so I had to reuse my old part. Disappointed, and also not sure if it matters, but the piece is clear not smoky like the other parts.",0
"I bought this for the same reason the other reviewer did: I have a large Sharpei/St. Bernard mix with black nails. I used this successfully maybe 3 times, then the plastic around where the cord plugs into the power adapter broke. I looked all over the web and at local electronics stores for a replacement, but the male/female ends are reversed on this, so I could not find one. The manufacturer did not offer a replacement adapter either that I could find.
Seriously disappointed. I bought a Dremel and use the tips with it at around 15-18,000 RPM.",0
This was way to large for my regularly size-small chihuahua.,0
"I have a (small) Golden Retriever....about 60 pounds. The first day she got in it, the zipper broke. I thought I'd save the hastle of returning it and just sew it shut, when the buckle around the headrest stopped holding. Really not made well and a piece of CRUD!",0
Beautiful!! Customer service is also great!,1
If you have a large puppy do not be fooled by the extra large size label. These are so thin and flimsy that they absorb very little. I used 4 times the number of pads in one day that I normally do with a Labrador puppy.,0
I was given 2 of the calcium and no alkalinity what am I supposed to do with that?,0
"Just got this, small and compact and seems to be good quality. Pretty much a black light in a small compact flashlight form. I would assume this would be great to check hotel sheets if you are one of those people that worry about things of such nature.

Other than that I am not really sure what to say. I guess this is good because it can easily be mistaken as just a flashlight and therefore people aren't assuming you are checking for stains.",1
"I've got two cats and neither one of them liked the catnip. They seemed to dislike it at first then after a couple of days, they showed no interest at all. I had made a little stuffed toy and put the catnip inside. I was very disappointed.",0
"Sheba is an indoor cat.  She doesn't play.  She sleeps and eats and looks miserable but doesn't know how to play since she became an adult.  She is about eight years old.

She loves this.  She took a couple days to figure it out but now sometimes sleeps with her head resting on it.  She is big and fat and lays on her side and I prop a book under one edge so the ball always rolls back to her.  She lazily bats and pushes and swats the ball around the track.  I hear her playing with this in the middle of the night.  She used to get up in the night and howl a few times but now, instead, she plays with this.

I can't recommend this enough.  If Sheba loves it any cat will.  Try propping a book under one edge if you have a big lazy cat like I do so the ball always returns to them.  She lays for hours next to this, occasionally swatting the ball.",1
"I purchased this to stop cats scratching on doorframes & furniture.  I was drawn by the natural ingredients.  Was very disppointed that being so oily, I could not use it on cloth covered furniture.  Additionally, it did not appreciably change the behavior despite several treatment s of doorframes.",0
dog pushed until the zipper came undone,0
"Dog loves it! Surely the plush softness makes up for the not being allowed on our furniture :) Only that once you wash it the filling gets kind of lumpy-to be expected I'd say, but overall decent quality.",1
"All the cans in the case are heavily dented, even the interior cans. Its like they took a bunch of rejected cans and packed them in a case.",0
My Dogs Woof These Right Down! Literally. We Cant Stock Enough.,1
"It worked really well for about a month. My cats loved it! But then the motor started sounding weird and the pump is barely working to pump water up through the tube and it's going only off of one side. My cats don't use it anymore and now I have to drip the faucets again which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place. My cats don't drink water out of bowls. They want fresh water. Who wouldn't?

Also I was thinking it would help keep the water cool... It's says in the description
"" provides your cat with a continuous  indoor source of cool,  fresh-tasting,  filtered water that encourages your cat to drink more""

It was never cool. I came home from work and it's luke warm.

I wanted to return it but I have had health issues that kind of put me back and I'm trying to get on top of things but I've already gone beyond my return window.",0
Hasn't even been a day and it's already tore apart,0
"my dog loves them, the salt on the streets is no match for these fine booties",1
Great quality!,1
It leaks,0
Ridgeback ripped a hole in it within 5 minutes. Then proceeded to rip out the stuffing. This did not last and was not worth the money.,0
"I own two American Bullys/ Pitbulls, the toy didn't last very long maybe a day or so. I would not make this purchase again.",0
I finally found the squeaker toy my ferocious guy can actually squeak!  All the others are just two large.  It is adorable to see him loving on his teddy bear.,1
Save your money the red bottle is as effective - little to none.,0
This is much better than covering cans with plastic wrap and securing with a rubber band. I've put them in the dishwasher and they hold up too!,1
"Really impressed with the heavy duty construction. This is made of braided webbing, this thing looks great!",1
"We love this carrier!  Initially unsure how our cat would travel, we purchased the largest one for our 14 lb cat for the car. He LOVES it - he loves the car and has to have a spot he can see out the window  We secure it  to the seats - I use small leashes to tie off to secure points and clip them to the d rings on the carrier making it easy to take in and out.  I also glued a piece of carpet to the inside back of the carrier, giving him a little more padding, and it doubles for a scratching surface - great at the hotel, we just leave it open, lying flat.  He has a small piece of fleece blanket inside to curl up under for long naps. I use a clip to secure the double zippers together so it does not open accidentally.
We did a lot of practice runs before out first trip - involving lots of kitty treats.  I always put treats inside to entice him in and keep the bag of treats in the pocket. He now comes running when he see his carrier - ready to go!
It is not light once he's in for me to carry for any length of time - but I do have back problems.  We both really wish I could take him for walks with it!  No problem and not uncomfortable carrying him for a bit.  The straps are rather far apart and could be uncomfortable if you have narrow shoulders - a clip for the front of the straps would help. Broad shouldered people will love it.
I use the wheels only for short distances.  It seems a pretty bumpy ride for him if it's not a very smooth surface.  It is a great option.
He is always to most popular guy at the vet's office modeling his carrier - everyone gets a kick out of it.  I think Pet Gear should offer commission to good sales kitties :-)",1
Very very small. It's just not what you think you're paying for!,0
"We bought this for a rental property and installed about 300 sf.  It isn't as dense as I'd like, but when raked, it looks fine. I really doubt the 71density rating, having checked out many samples. The color is very realistic.  Installation -- not as easy as we'd hope.  Getting the edges to lay down flat and not curl was a problem, even with the yard staples that we used.  Make sure that you make every strip run the same direction, or else it will look striped.  For the price, it's a good deal, and in the dessert, it will be a good product with no watering and mowing.",1
"I purchased this because I couldn't find any pure ammonia anywhere. I used this in combination with DrTim's one and only starter bacteria. It took 2.5 weeks for the nitrites to show up and another 2 for the nitrates. I'm not sure if the bacteria helped or the cycle happened naturally. Either way I guess this ammonia worked since I didn't have any fish in there. I'm deducting star because like others said, this didn't show up with my ammonia test kit. I just had to follow the directions on the bottom and hope for the best. In the end it worked though",1
"Awesome product! I love that it's all natural and still really effective! Good job, worth every penny",1
"Got this tank for my 5 year old, she loves it!! It is our first tank and I'm very happy with it. Easy to put together and looks nice. I did have a hard time getting my LED bubbler lights to stay down in the tank, but the manufacturer sent me a new light for free!! Wonderful customer service and I'm very happy we chose this tank!",1
Lazy poopscoopers go get that litter box. I have 2 already.,1
My dog absolutely loves this toy. She usually chews through anything we get her but this one has lasted us months and it's her go to chew toy.,1
Good,1
"My cat was not fooled.  I ended up having to use the Kong Salmon Paste.  That worked like a charm. These pills are far too large, too easily broken up, and even if made into smaller my cat was still not impressed.  It didn't work for me.  And they are expensive!",0
The rocks are tiny compared to how you display them for sale.  And who wants rocks that disappear in 6 months!,0
"I remember feeding these several years back with a former dog, but I could not remember how tiny they were. It is interesting that the weight range for the minis is 5-25 lbs. My girls who are 13 lbs. are probably going to devour these in one bite which makes me question how well they will be able to digest them. My smallest is 6 pounds. She ate it pretty quickly today, but so far, she was the only one who has had one. We shall see how things go!

Update: I have 5 dogs here. 4 of them got sick after eating these bones. Only 1 of the dogs had 2 bones a day apart. The others had a bone each. It was coming up and going out the other end. If I didn't know one of the sick dogs was a slow, methodical eater, I'd blame it on the girls not chewing. Unfortunately, there is something in these that does not agree with any of them. I tried the carrot bones several years ago with the same reaction.",0
"I have had excellent luck purchasing from Amazon (and I order a lot of items) until today.  Two items arrived - packaged separately. One was broken. The other was SUPPOSED to be a box of Scoop Away Free.  I opened the undamaged package to find the box of kitty litter totally split open and dumped out into the larger cardboard packaging box.  After much ado to get the litter into a plastic bag, I looked at the litter box and saw that they had sent me Unscented with Ammonia Shield (which I cannot use) rather than the FREE version of the litter.  As this item is not returnable for any reason, I am simply out of pocket on this.",0
"Love the color, good quality. Good size for a small dog or even medium Lab-sized dogs. Love the folding shape and that it comes with a clip.",1
I've had 3 of these treat pouches and I love them! Dogs can't pick my pocket anymore!,1
"I like the size, and the wheels make it really convenient. Only downside is that the edges on the lid were super sharp. I had to file them down so I don't cut my fingers.",1
"Brought this for my 4 month old shiba.  He loves going outdoors, but I like to keep him close from other distractions.  He now knows to stay near my side, so the slack is almost unnecessary with proper training.",1
Took one cat literally 10 minutes for it to rip at the seams. Would not buy again.,0
"This is great for keeping the cats off the counter. The only downside is the expensive refills. I have used regular air sprays made for removing dust from keyboards, but their spray isn't nearly as strong and loud as the SSSCat ones, so they are worth it for the extra umph. The cats are trained with spray bottles, so the air spray is very reminiscent of that for them. Also, the sound is usually startling. It's not an extremely consistent spray (as most reviews will acknowledge), but the inconsistency still works, because the cats ""never know"" whether it will go off so they just assume it will. Definitely a worthy investment. But be warned, it takes a while before the humans get used to it spraying!

Update 6/20/15: Basically this hasn't proved nearly as effective with the off-brand refills. And geez they need refilled so often, and my boyfriend always forgets to turn on the sprays anyway. So it's the best we've used so far, but still not 100% effective. My cat is very smart, and has also learned when it's on (partially because it will randomly spray when it's on and no one is near it), so he's figured out when it's off as well. The money on refills and energy remembering to turn it on has made it much less effective than I'd like. And I really need two of them to keep him off both counters. My next step is the PetSafe indoor cat barrier (shock collar), which will hopefully be amazing. We'll see!",1
I have one medium dog and one large dog and both of them use this without going to the toilet instead. The filter does not really do anything because some sediment does gather in the bottom of the bowl. It holds enough water for several days and the jar is easily refilled while its running.,1
Did not hold and went straight thru. Was super bummed they didn't work out,0
very cheaply made. It was advertised to fit my size dog BUT it was no way big enough.,0
Great,1
A must have if you have a large fish tank.,1
Not pretty at all.  Looks like dirty metal.,0
"They are always waiting for their treat and devour this like there's no tomorrow. I haven't read closely enough to determine how healthy it is, as I typically don't feed them anything inferior. I use this primarily to fatten up my elderly diabetic kitty and have determined it doesn't throw his bg count out of whack like other treats have done in the past. My dogs run to get any scraps that have been left behind, they are just like that.",1
Did not like at all. Not sturdy at all. Cat will not use it.,0
Lasted not even a week.  My dog broke it and pieces came off. Had to throw it away!!,0
"Well, the dogs really love playing with this toy but I have a hard time getting the rope to stay on the launcher long enough to fling it.  I think it may take more practice but as long as the dogs love it, that's all that really matters.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I am overall happy that I decided to purchase it.

The ball comes with the string threaded through the ball.  You take the string onto the launches and pull back on the ball like a sling shot and you just sling the ball by letting go.  The issue I had was the little lip on the the launcher should have been made just a little deeper so you can really get the rope to sit it in well as you are pulling back on the ball.

I will say I have 2 dogs.  I have a chihuahua mix and a shih-tzu mix.  The chiahuahua is all about running after that ball.  She runs and gets it and then flings it herself all over the place.  It's really funny.  The Shih-tzu waits until the other dog walks away from it, steals it and chews on the ball.  The ball has sustained NO damage at this point, but my dogs are NOT strong chewers.  They do love the toy and they each play with it in their own way.  Great little toy.  I would recommend it for sure.",1
"I bought this along with the Chicken and Salmon flavor that was a re-order.  The Beef was not a hit.  The cubes are much ""harder"", didn't disolve in liquid, and none of my four cats would touch it, dry or wet or even wetter.  The Chicken breaks up nicely, and 3 of my four cats think it is a treat, and they are spoiled. (The dog got the Beef mixed in with his food until it was gone.  It is spendy.)  I like the company and their story and the USA made.  Bags aren't that big, but it is ""freeze dried"" and you wouldn't really want a big bag to sit and get old, would you?  I am sticking to the Chicken and Salmon variety.",0
"If your dog loves it it's 5 stars, right?  The pulleez arms are very fun for fetch and tug games. Cute!",1
"I tried two sizes of this muzzle, the M/L and the L for my 65 pound mixed breed dog.  The M/L was too small.  The L fits his snout but the hole for his mouth - where the treats are supposed to go in, doesn't line up with his mouth.  I tried flipping it upside down and it didn't work that way either.  Also, the binding on the edge of the muzzle is pretty rough - I think it would irritate his skin if he wore it on a walk.  I prefer the ""softie"" muzzle that has soft neoprene-like binding so it's softer on the skin - but it doesn't have a hole for treats.  I hope Guardian Gear tweaks their design a little since it's a great idea.",0
"For some reason Miss Barker disliked the toy.  As did her playmates.
Wonder if the dyes used to color the product are distasteful?
Too bad, so sad: it went into the trash.  Another idiotic purchase
that contributes to landfills.  Drat!",0
My dog loves these,1
"I bought one of these for my musk turtle a few months ago. He already had a favorite basking spot (one of the faux rock 'caves') but already outgrew the opening in his first fake cave, so I thought I'd plan ahead. The platform did stay in place, helped by the magnets, but when I took the tank down for a regular cleaning a couple of weeks ago & pulled out this platform I was blasted by a hideous, chemical-ish, toxic-waste-type smell. I was utterly appalled --it smelled AWFUL, and I couldn't imagine that it could be healthy for Sir Edmund to be wallowing in whatever is coming off this thing. I cleaned out his tank really well & rinsed everything. The platform went straight into the trash (tho I worry about the landfill...what could be safe disposal for this thing???).

So far, Sir E seems to be showing no ill effects, thank heavens. I can't imagine what the heck this thing is made of; the faux rock caves look like similar plastic, but after years of use, they have no smell at all besides an occasional algal whiff. I wouldn't use one of these things again around a live animal if you paid me.",0
This stuff is great.  Removes stains and smells great - Second Order - Highly Recommend,1
"Nice quality, fit's well, looks good! She hasn't been in the water with it yet but nice to know my lil yorkie girl's protected when she's out in the boat with us ; )",1
Cat food everywhere.  Bag ripped open. Hardly any food left in bag. All over other products ordered. What should we do?,0
This box is super easy to clean! Just tip it and everything lands in the drawer! Easiest cat box to clean ever! Highly recommend. This one is smaller - for one cat only. If you have multiple cats or even a larger cat I would recommend buying the larger model.,1
My birds like it so far and still healthy as well.,1
"This crate is HUGE. It was a lot bigger than I expected. I got it for a medium sized dog (60lbs)  and a pitbull puppy. I wanted to keep them together in the crate while he was still little. Im using it to crate train my puppy. If i need to mop, I put both of them in the crate and they have so much room that they actually play in the crate. I could probably put another dog in there with the two I have and they would fit!

It doesn't look to be made ofor the strongest material but my dogs have bumped around in it while playing and it's fine. If you have a dog who is an escape artist, then I would maybe try a different crate.",1
"I bought these because they were on sale and I saw them on Shark Tank. I go camping about a dozen times a year with my dog and packing dog food for longer trips gets annoying because it's heavy and takes up a lot of space. I liked that they packed easily and weren't filled with junk ingredients. I have an 8lbs terrier mix, so one bad equals two meals for her. The bar was kinda hard snap in half evenly, but it was even harder to break it up into littler pieces for her to eat since I didn't want to just give her the whole piece. She loves the taste and gets excited when she hears the crinkle of the wrapper. Would buy again, but only for longer camping trips.",1
"Where do I start. I bought this based of the reviews. I would never buy this again

-clips to hold the top to the bottom are plastic and will open on you when rolling it leaving all the bad stuff you want to catch on your floor. I tried to secure the top and bottom with zip ties but it didn't help litter would pour out the gaps
-the screen that shifts the litter will come loose on you if you tap the bottom of the box when you roll it.  If you don't tap the bottom the urine litter cakes to the bottom and doesn't come out. You can't fill this with enough litter to prevent the bottom caking issue
-if you get a big enough clump in the pull out tray it won't work and will scrape the top of the clump of making a mess

I theory this should work perfect, in real life it made my litter box cleaning a much bigger chore which this was supposed to help make smaller",0
"The pump lasted a little over a year, then just suddenly stopped working, which left the cats without a working water fountain. It is a good thing I have multiple water sources for them because I was away for a long weekend at the time.

I have never owned a water fountain before so have no idea if one year is the standard life for a water pump but it seems to me they should last longer than that. I priced a replacement at Amazon.com and it is $15.99. Since I only paid $28 for the entire fountain at Petsmart, I'd rather buy a whole new fountain of another - more reliable - brand then spend $16/year replacing the pump.

As noted by other reviewers, it's not that easy to clean. Water deposits build up on the blue top rim and are really hard to get off. I don't want to use a harsh cleanser for fear some residue would remain no matter how well I rinse and be harmful to the cats.

Look elsewhere.",0
Ginger get a lot of catnip toys but this banana is her absolute favorite.  She is jumping for it before I get it out of the box.  Some other ones don't even et a second sniff.,1
Pitbull figured out how to get disk out of ball and just eats the disk treat.,0
"I have ordered 10 red crystal shrimp and 10 black crystal shrimp in total, all shrimps are male, I don't know how they can get baby",0
"My cats got used to it from day one. I got this product to keep my dogs out of the litter box and it has worked! I have not noticed any additional odor from using this litter box. It is a litter box so there will be odor. If anything, I have less odor now then I did before. I went ahead and bought one more and I am glad I did. Really no mess around the box at all and easy clean up. I ordered the liners to go with it and it was worth it as well. Sometimes I use trashbags instead of the liners, samething.  Great buy!",1
"hard to handle when over half full, when water gets dirty from dogs using it, you have to drain the bowl part and wash it, which means the bottle has to be flipped and set somewhere, always resulting in spilage..oh well. fill the bottle, flip it, and the bottle is now 1/3 empty already.
So...

After a few months of using this, Im throwing it out as scum grows on the inside of the bowl overnight, and to clean it requires a lot of messy spilling and bottle flipping. Whatever Microban it has in the plastic is inadequate to keep it clean for even two days",0
"This is a must have for squishy faced doggies. I got it for my english bulldog and it works great. Easy to use, it doesn't leak like some of the reviews have suggested. You have to make sure you screw the top correctly, if it's lopsided then it'll leak. I love it and use it when i travel or go on walks.",1
"I wouldn't recommend this product.  They are not soft....they are hard as a rock.  They smell horrible and my cat wants nothing to do with them.  They seem flavored for dogs, not cats.",0
Our lab had the toy for all of 5 minutes. He put a hole and significant chew marks on it. Guess this toy is designed for strong chewers!,0
"Seams not fully sewn, the stuffing was coming out right out of the box.

Not recommended",0
"my beagle loves to root out the squirrels in this thing, and then run off with them like she's just robbed the place. My shepard also loves the little squeaky squirrels in it, and will gnaw on them for a good long time. A good multi-functional toy that is more interesting than a ball.",1
birds favorite new toy and at a great price,1
It was larger that I thought it would be - which was great!,1
My bluebirds love this.,1
All my puppy wanted to do is eat it.  Spent all my time pulling pieces out of her mouth.,0
My dog would walk out of this harness.,0
"I originally loved this purchase. It is made of thick material, and guides my dog by pulling on his body. However, after a mere couple months of use, the clip is permanently stuck. I couldn't get the harness off my dog because the clip was stuck. I'm going to buy another one because it was useful, but I wish it had a longer life span.",0
This is a very good cat brush...I was surprised by how easily it rakes out loose hair and how much my cat doesn't mind it.  Very inexpensive as well!  My cat is regular short hair...don't know if it would work as well on long hair?,1

"We have a Carin Terrier (Think Wizard of Oz dog) who is 9 years old and missing a few teeth. He was THRILLED with this item. The squeak was high pitched and he ran off with it and had a blast! HOWEVER, within 1 hour he had this thing completely torn UP. The entire outer covering (yellow part) was torn off and his face was covered in the remaining fuzz.  Part of the covering was still attached and he then began working on the inner ""ball"" part. The squeak ceased at the hour and 10 minute mark once he pierced the inner ball with his geriatric teeth.  These balls are larger than a tennis ball, so the fact a Carin Terrier who is 9 years old and missing a few teeth could do this much damage in under 1 and a half hours tells me this is not the best made product. I agree it could be a choking hazard as someone else posted.  My dog LOVED it but as a dog mom I did not.  He played with it non-stop until I decided to take it away once he torn the ball in half. I was concerned he might start getting smaller pieces of the core. I have no idea what it is made of and didn't want to risk a toxic outcome. I will not recommend or buy again. I bought 3 sets. I plan to return the unopened sets.",0
It is missing one of the suction cups so is not useable. There are also no instructions included.,0

"This is the exact same type of pill the vet gave me for a cat that is having liver problems. It has worked great for him.
From what the vet told us, it should be taken on an empty stomach - giving with food will dilute the medication. I try to give it to the cat in need every morning a little while before the cats are fed.

This pill is quite large and following up with some water will help make sure the pill is swallowed all the way and is not stuck in the throat.

There are many Youtube videos that document how to give a cat a pill. It can be a difficult process but it is possible. I prefer using the method where you hold the head back which allows you to use your pinky to open the mouth and pop the pill in. Holding the head back mechanically makes opening the jaw easier on you and the cat.

Our cat is a bit of a fighter when it comes to taking medication but I have been able to give him this one successfully, so just make sure to get the technique down.

This container has 60, 100mg tablets

Pros:
*Great price
*Same medication as given by the vet

Cons:
*Kind of a large pill for smaller cats(-1/2 a star)

Additional Considerations:
Make sure to syringe a few millilitres of water after putting the pill in. It helps make sure the cat swallows and doesn't spit up the pill.

Overall: 4.5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

doesn't even smell like catnip oil not a good buy my cats don't even care about it at all,0
Cost a lot of money for such a small amount. It made my cat more active when it was sprayed. He also meowed more when I sprayed it. Both were the opposite of what I was looking for.,0
"I have a picky kitty who snubs a lot of other dry cat foods.  She loves this stuff and comes running each morning demanding that I fill up her bowl.  I actually put double her quantity in the dish since it appears that we're also feeding the neighbor's cats as well.  At Amazon prices, I'd rather be inclusive of other's cats than exclusive to mine.

great product for the price,1

"If you hate your cat, feed this.
I've had a fostser mom and kittens for about a month. They have been fine, without ever even coughing up a hairball. Allowed their other foods to run out last night. Momma cat ate half a bowl of this, then puked all over the house. I read reviews that other cats vomited after eating it. I felt so bad! Will not even feed this to the dogs. Maybe the sea gulls can stomach it.",0
Bad for skin allergies. These had my dog scratching and biting his skin till he was bleeding. There is a long list of ingredients in these rawhides.,0
"It's easy to put together and well-made. Allows plenty of room for our puppy to play when we can't keep a close eye on her (eg cooking dinner). Because it packs nicely, we were also able to take it on a trip, which was convenient. We received it very quickly, too.",1

Too harsh of a collar for our little dog.  She also didn't respond to it so no help at all.,0
Was a lot smaller than expected would rather by way more seachem matrix for my money,0
"The problem with this is that it puts the entire dog's weight on one shoulder on a skinny not padded strap. Since my dog is seven pounds I thought this wouldn't be a problem, but the weight quickly adds up pushing straight down. I tried adjusting the strap higher and lower, but it still bothers me almost immediately. I have ordered one which goes on the front of the body with two padded shoulder straps, maybe that will work better. For the record I am a fit healthy person.",0
Seems to be working well for my chihuahua mix after his neuter surgery. It is soft enough to bend as he tries to get comfortable sleeping but firm enough to keep him from licking. The draw string fastener makes it easy to take on and off. I also like that it is light weight. ,1

"Decent bed, but wasn't as thick as described. Also, only last a few days before the dogs tore it up, at which point I got to see what it's like under the cover. It's memory foam, but it's actually two pieces glued together, rather than one big piece of foam. Would not get again.",0
Blue Buffalo is a company known for its healthy pet products. I was lucky enough to purchase a large bag at a nice price. The pellets are little and that's what my cats prefer.,1

Works very well. One year old dog running first time. Gave him small treat each time to reinforce what he is supposed to do.,1
The super scoop doesn't clump well at all for my cats. They are both over 20lbs and I'm sure this has something to do with that. The multi cat by arm and hammer clumps well.,0
None of my dogs liked it...,0
I purchased this item and when I got it the piece insidec was detached. I emailed the vendor and they sent me another. Before I received it I found this item at walmart and decided to buy it. When I received the replacement I gave it to my dog and it was broken in less then an hour. By the way the one I got from walmart is still working. This is a big rip off and bad costomer service. I will never buy anything from globalpet ever again!!!!,0
Awesome,1
Box was damaged and banged up and kennel was all scratched up. Also tray doesnt slide out properly. Ends were bent as well.,0

"For years I have been buying one brush or another from the local pet store for my dogs and never have been satisfied. They are either so expensive I wonder if they are made of gold (and don't buy them) or they are priced reasonably but work cheap and don't last. Nothing ever worked good enough.
Then I remembered one day; a curry comb! I would never have tried to keep a horse groomed properly without starting with a curry comb (haven't had horses in decades, but one day I just remembered). I thought it would help my Akita/pit mix with his nasty double coat. It did more than I could have imagined! Does miracles, not only on his coat, but on his skin; flakes are gone. Does miracles on my Golden/Poodle/Foxhound mix too. I didn't even know how bad she had it until I used this on her. My dogs line up to be brushed now and this thing seems built to last.",1

However, the whale he has a strange affinity for. He carries it around the house whining like he wants to hide it from others. He even sleeps with it like it is his best friend. Nonetheless, it keeps him occupied and that is what I was searching for.

Good job developing this one.",1
The Gentle Leader head collar is a great tool for controlling large dogs who like to pull.  I like the color options.,1

Rena/Mars Fishcare is the worst company I have ever dealt with. The customer service is a joke. If you can get someone to answer the phone or return your messages all they will do is make you jump through hoops until you are so frustrated you just give up. The whole time your fish suffer. I purchased an XP filter and it quit working after 2 weeks. You're better off spending your money on ANY OTHER FILTER.,0

Professional groomer here and i swear by these and the clippers that use them. Always good,1
"I really don't know how to rate this product at all. My two kittens LOVE it. Maybe to a fault. I want to love it, but I've had this toy for less than 24 hours, and the attachment that connects the string to the extender rod has come off twice--once during each play session.

"With a baby on the way, we need to keep the cats out of our bedroom till the baby should be in the crib. Closing the door triggers the cats to relentlessly meow and scratch at the door. We tried scents and tape to no avail. We decided to try this and it works perfectly. We heard the device go off 3 or 4 times and now the cats don't even go near the door while the device is near it.

When I tested the device it was not responding to a wave in front of the sensor. I found that the device has a delay of maybe 30-60 seconds or so once turned on. Afterwards it is quite effective. I was also concerned of the sensor's responsiveness in low light but it has not been an issue at all.

Money well spent in my opinion and I recommend this to anyone. I also believe that animals will associate the spray with the device itself making the sight of it a deterrent. I really doubt we will even need a refill. I'm excited to learn how it will perform as a ward for our Christmas Tree. If it works well, maybe we can actually get a nice tree :)",1
this product did NOT keep the order down.  I will not but this ever again.  Of course this is my opinion.,0

Depends on your dog. Our Dog needed probiotics.,1
"REVISED COMMENT AFTER USING FOR 1 MONTH...I can no longer use the feeder because the bowl that the dog eats from does not stay attached to the rest of the feeder.  The bowl constantly detaches and the food goes all over the floor.  It did it one time and scared the fur off of my dog, so she is scared to go anywhere near it.  If you can find a way to attach the bowl, then this is the feeder for you, otherwise, keep looking past this one.

PREVIOUS COMMENT:
I needed to have surgery and I was looking for a feeder.  I didn't have much time to research, but I knew I wanted one that could dispense up to three meals, at whichever times you want, and you could change the serving size all the way up to 2 cups.  This one was exactly the one.  It was super easy to program (like setting a clock)!  You can put so much food in the storage bin it would last a week.  It is loud when the food comes out, and the first time the dog was scared of it, then she saw it was her food, and the fear was gone and she loves it now.  When the food comes out she runs towards it like it was spitting out steaks!  I have kept it on after I got home from surgery cause it keeps her on a schedule, and its such a joy to watch her get so happy when it dispenses.  Also, the usual remarks for Amazon:  best price available and quickest shipping around too.  Must have for cats or dogs.  I have a golden who gets larger kibble and it comes out fine.",0

My dogs love it!!,1
It is 2 small 4 my dog,1
Be careful about ordering this size for small to medium dogs. It is for toy breeds. My dogs are 15 pounds which is small but they can not lay down comfortably with a water dish attached to it. They can barely lay down with no water dish attached. I got the next size up which is a bit large for them but I would rather have them comfortable. It is a challenge to have 2 medium size crates if you have limited space. I do love the crate just be aware you must have a really tiny pup to fit the 640 size,0
"What a great company.  As a first time traveler with a pet, they were invaluable.  Their products are spot on and really made the travel process as painless as possible.

Great Product - Great Company.",1
Don't waste your money.  On maximum setting my Lab didn't even flinch when she barked with the collar against her skin.,0
A while back I tried this product with a Shih Tzu and just recently I tried it with a Havanese.  In both cases it didn't slow them down a bit. My Vet recommended the product so it must work with some animals.,0

Very small.i was looking for an American size large.gifted it to another pet parent who adores it and will have it on her dog come fall season,0
Do not waste your money!  The rope is only held together with electrical tape.  One tug and the product becomes unusable.,0
Product was awesome for a week! First it fell off while he was playing and then the dog managed to get It off his collar and eat through it within less than 2 weeks of having it!,0

"It looks great in my tank, I picked all neutral colors and with my Malaysian drift wood I think  it looks awesome ...  I do wish it was heavier I had add some extra weights but overall not a big deal.",1
"I use mine with the pine pellets which means 2 cats go through a pad about every 2-3 days; however, the pine really cuts down on the smell, and even with the added expensive of pads, I am saving hundreds of dollars a year because I can get a 40 lb bag of pine pellets from the feed store for about $6.50.

I transitioned my two girls (Laverne and Shirley) by using their old box and mixing pine pellets in with their A&H Clump and Seal litter, adding more pine and more pine over about 2 weeks Of course, when urinated on in the old box, the pine was tracked all over the house which was my issue with all the other litters to begin with. Next, I put the Breeze pellets and pine pellets in the Breeze litter box and set it beside the old one. I quit cleaning the old one for the most part, and after about two weeks of that, I pulled the old box away. All I do now is pick out the solid waste every day and a half or so, and when I do, I stir the litter to let the wet pine fall through to the pad below. No tracking! This was my biggest issue other than the cost of their old litter. With my adaptation of the Breeze- both problems solved!

For those of you wanting a hood, their old litter box was a Arm & Hammer box with a top, and as it turns out, the top snuggles down on the breeze box, simulating a hood just fine. The box and hood is $15 at Walmart: http://www.walmart.com/ip/Arm-Hammer-Hooded-Cat-Litter-Pan-With-Advanced-Odor-Scatter-Control-Cats/21677769.",1

It also never gets knotted like my previous flat leash.  It also has just a very elegant look, which I really like.  I would say the 3/8 will work well for up to 25 pounds.  Over 25 pounds should probably go up to the next width.",1

I got this vest for Angel last year and she loves it. It's easy to you'se and I think everyone with a service or thearpy dog should have one.,1

Didn't work for my cats.,0
Too small and it is not what I expected.,0
"Very thin, feels like tissue paper. They keep sliding around or just the movement of people  or animals rushing past will cause them to blow around. My dog won't use one of those pad holders so I ran into this problem. The pads are small too.
On the + side I will say these are not being chewed on like many of the  others. My 5 yr old Puppy mill rescue dog will chew the trim around many of the other brands but shes left these alone.",0
"Very small, and not good control when it's thrown. It's like throwing a paper plate. Not a happy customer! Don't waste your money",0
"I bought two of these at Petsmart for[...]each. I was a little curious when the clerk told me to be sure to save my receipt, as I would need it if I decided to return them. Now I understand.

I like the concept of the scat mat, and I liked the Pawz Away in particular because it was battery operated so I didn't have to mess around with a power cord. These are powered by a 9 volt battery.

I have a pair of[...] old Shih-Tzu's who are adorable, housebroken and very sweet, but I don't like them going into the living room and dining room, and they think they're entitled to be in there.

I have two doorways into these areas and got one Pawz Away for each. I know they worked because I shocked the heck out of myself a couple of times while hooking the battery compartment to the mat - they snap on. My wife also got a shock when she walked on them a couple of times after forgetting they were there. That's another feature of the mats that I really liked - they just sort of blend in to the floor and it's easy to forget they are there.

However, for whatever reason my dogs never set them off and got the ""correction"". I personally watched each dog stroll casually across each mat a number of times without a care in the world. When I returned them to Petsmart the dog trainer there said maybe my dogs just didn't really feel the shock (it's like a strong static electricity shock).

I know that wasn't the case because I had each device set to also beep when it activated. And the only beep I ever heard was when I ended up shocking myself.

Anyway, I don't know if my dogs were too light to set the things off, or they're poorly designed or what the problem was, but after five days of frustration I returned them.

Maybe you'll have better luck and maybe they work better with larger dogs. But they didn't work for me.",0

"It works..... But changed to a higher gauge wire right off the batt. Have to change 9v battery in collar once a week, that's why only two stars. Looking into finding a different collar that is compatible.",0
"Please note that while this product its self fine, even WITH Prime, this has taken over 10 days to arrive.  It can only be shipped via ground, so if you are on the East Coast, you will not get this for several weeks.  Could be an itchy situation if you are a last minute shopper.  Might as well go to Petco.",0
I can't recommend due to the horrible chemical smell. Never even used ours the smell was so awe full even after washing several times. Looks super cool but didn't want to have my Bearded Dragons breathing heavy toxic smelling fumes. If something smells that's bad it can't be good.,0
This was a complete waste of money.  Cheaply made. My dog had ZERO interest. I returned it.,0
My cats like it.  It looks and smells okay.  I don't see anything in it but chicken.  I alternate it between a couple of other flavors and kitties are doing well and seem happy with this.,1
"This has survived a Magu attack! My boxer has destroyed ""indestructible"" toys and has left anything and everything in his wake. This has still survived after 1 year and Magu liked it so much that I got it for my friend's rottweiler puppy.",1
"Perhaps for a garage... but in the house this was too big & bulky! Not being able to see inside doesn't help. We ended up making more of a mess using this than some of the high sided, but ""Open"" boxes. Not for us!!",0
"I have a Rottweiler, and purchased the XXL for him. He is a typical Rott male, weighing about 100 with a pretty large chest. This size fit him like a baby t, but it fit my much smaller beagle boxer mix. It is a good product.",1
I had ordered two of these originally ....one for each car after reading reviews.  I had one of the silicone collapsable cups that I filled with a water bottle....and thought this might be better.  Things I liked were you could squeeze out small amounts into the drinking tray.  It also didn't leak on me.  However the negative outweighed the positive and I cancelled the order for the second bottle.  The negative was that not only did it not really stand well upright closed....but also not opened.  So when I went to a restaurant with my pup I couldn't put it down on the floor for her to drink whenever she wanted....I would have to hold it the entire time.  The little silicone cup ends up being much better in my book.,0
"I ordered this when my platies presented me with many unexpected and unwanted fry. Couldn't kill them so I had to do something to keep the water parameters under control with an over stocked tank. It seems to have done an excellent job so far the normal toxins that the fish deposit in the tank are well with the safe limits.

Even better it a lot cheaper than any other filter type that could do the job.",1
"I bought the green and the yellow lite-up leashes for our dogs at Christmas time.  They worked for about two walks.  I thought the batteries had just died, but when I replaced the batteries (with new ones), the leash would not light up.  I thought it was my mistake, so I got different batteries and got my husband involved, but still the leashes will not work.  VERY Disappointing.",0
Should be fine for kittens.  Pretty color.  Haven't really put it to use yet but looking forward to seeing how it will clean up.,1
"Like  The magnetic strip at the bottom of the  vinyl door.
 But take great care when drilling holes very tight tolerances. Which is good,  makes it a little difficult to work the nylon screws through the door and frame",1
"As others have noted, nearly impossible to remove from small cans.  It does fit the small Fancy Feast cans, but good luck getting the lid off.",0
I read the reviews for this and they were very positive so I tried them out.  And my dog just loves these.  Great product!,1
"Nice solid scooper. Little hanger thing doesn't seem to really be made for the scooper though, and fell off the wall where I stuck it within a couple of hours.",1
Didn't like it . Smaller than I thought and my puppy ran from it,0
I have two dogs that love barking and are in a 10X10 enclosure when I'm at work. I bought these collars after my neighbors complained they barked while I was gone......they lasted 3 days....My dogs hated them and decided to tear them off of each other....I'm now out $100 and they are still barking....:(,0
I've removed an entire second animal's worth of hair.  My cat is having much less hairball problems.  He doesn't like this as much as a regular brush so I comb him for shorter amounts of time more often.  Wish I would have gotten this sooner!  Very sturdy and comfortable to use.,1
Took long time to get but was nice product,1
"I really don't like anything about it.  Some products have a strainer to prevent gravel or SNAILS from clogging the tiny hole at the top of the large
tube.  This one does not.  Constant clog from dead snail shells.  Pretty much useless.  Will be more careful on my selection next time.  Live and
learn.",0
"Nicely made, great colors!",1
I have an old skinny cat & a young fat one.... Neither one will eat this stuff. They are driving e crazy because they say they're hungry  but less than a cup of this high price cat food has been eaten.....,0
Somewhat sharp compared to other blades.,1
"Great! my cat loves it. It's crinkly, it's a tube, it has a hole. He's in it most days.",1
Looks great,1
Very comfortable for my puppy bed,1
i had my vet fit this one and it still slides down his head. i followed the video and when it slid down i got my vet to do it. I think thats the reason he keep trying to get out of it. When i first put it on it was fine. i got him used to it around the house for about a week and he seemed annoyed but nothing else. when we went outside he freaked when it would slide down because it was chocking him. When it was in place it was perfect.,0
"I like how it goes around her neck, my little one is an escape artist and wiggles her way out of most everything. Draw back is the neck part isn't adjustable. It is a little loose but when I attach her collar to the harness it keeps her secure.",1
"Update: the material is now even thinner than ever. It's tearing just from putting litter IN the liner. Tossing out everything and finding another brand.

Original: Been ordering these for years. For the last maybe year or so, the liner went to a thinner feel and recently appears it's back to a thicker material, which is sort of nice. These don't last more than maybe 5 days before your cat's nails will start to tear through the plastic, so I just bag up the whole thing and put in fresh litter every few days. That's how it's always been with these liners and doesn't bother me at all.

The newish thicker liner is tearing a bit just pulling them out of the box where they heat seal it with the drawstring. That's the only downside of the current production quality. For some reason my cat has also managed to puncture it at the bottom despite being thicker, but I think that might have just been a fluke and I didn't have enough litter in there to begin with.",0
I have been using this for the past week in my English and French Bulldogs breakfast and they seem to really like it.  My English doesn't seem to notice it but the French runs over to the other bowl to see if there is any remnants of it and licks it all up.  No issues so far and it seems to keep their tummies happy!,1
"Don't particularly like this item.  Since it doesn't collect much hair from my three short haired cats, I use it to massage their skin.",0
I have a 2 month old pug who forgot about all his other toys. This is by far his favourite!,1
My cat wouldn't eat it and even the outside strays wouldn't touch it and they normally will eat anything.,0
SOOOOOO CUTE,1
This was not a tough toy. My 45 pound pitbull broke it within 15 mins,0
"Got my product as scheduled.  Took it out of the package, and it was as simple to use as descri ed within a half an hour my forty gallon aquarium was cleaned and crystal clear.  Awesome product especially for the price.",1
"I like these balls because they bounce better than the ball that came with the chuckit, adding distance to your throw. Only issue is that when my dogs slobber gets on them they aren't as secure in the launcher. Still functions but I like to dangle the ball in front of my dog and when it's slobbery sometimes it slips out.",1
"Very weak scent, not good for dog grooming.",0
Horrible cheap and doesnt do what it says the glad ones are amazing!,0
"not as effective as kong brush.  also, it can hurt your kitty if you brush too hard.  going back to kong brush.  much safer brush.",0
"Followed directions and results showed within two weeks,  helping my dogs skin heal and the fur grow back.  Less scratching and I feel like I am helping him.  Good product.",1
Perhaps it is the reaction of the fleas dying but my 30 lb dog went absolutely crazy once that pill kicked in  - scratching and chewing on herself.  She was totally out of breath and panting hard.  That coupled with this pill being needed everyday for a few days is just more than I will put her through.  I'm going back to Advantix.,0
"Peculiarly, one of the most effective kitchen helpers to come along in a long time. The missing star has to do with my personal confusion as to whether I love or hate silicone.",1
"I have 2 others of these and they work great - love 'em.  This last one I got buzzed really really bad, instead of the nice steady hum that my others sound like.  This must've been a bad one in the batch.  I had to throw it away it was awful.  I will buy another one, but just a warning out there, you may get a bad one like I did.  If you do, return it right away!  I kept mine & tried to quiet it down but it was a lost cause.",0
The container is not large enough to fit replacement bags without tremendous hassle and frustration.  I have only been successful two times placing replacement bags in the container.  The other four times I tried I was not successful and the bags came unrolled as I tryed to stuff them in.  It is not easy to place the bags in the container and thread the beginning of the bags through the hole in the dispenser.  I hate this container and I am looking to buy something else.  I do like the hands free concept of being able to walk and not hold poop bags in my hand.  I just want a dispenser big enough to hold replacement bags/rolls with ease.  I rate it a one because I thought the bone shaped dispenser was really cute.,0
It becomes extremely warm/hot in the carriage for my dog.  Certainly wouldn't want to use this for a dog over 20 lbs.,1
"I thought these looked like a safe non-rawhide treat and was going to purchase them for my dog, but one look at the ingredients told me NO. If humans were to eat the same stuff (corn, fructose, barley malt syrup, maltodextrin, titanium dioxide, etc) every day, we'd end up sick and/or diabetic so why give it to our dogs? Add in the sorbitol (see other reviewsNOT good for dogs!) and I quickly clicked off the page. You should too if you care about the health of your pooch!",0
Works very well but lookout if you get a tiny grain of sand in the velcro! Scratch city!,1
Didn't fit in my cars bucket seats & took up the entire back seat. Ended up buying a $20 cat bed from Petco & attaching it to the seatbelt with a little creativity.,0
"lightweight and strong, easy to use, no problem for my crippled dog.",1
Not happy wanted lettering brighter some letters can barley see,0
"I had a SSSCat system for about a year or so. Decided to try using it again. Ordered the 6 refills.  The old top or sprayer doesn't fit right the can leaks. I hear air escaping when I place the head on the new cans.  I thought I had it so the leak stopped. When I got up the next morning the whole can was empty!!!!!!

Now what do I do?",0
"way smaller then the original one i got years ago. only my smallest cat will fit. 9lbs but she is very short.
if you can get the BIG version then its worth it.
Costs too much to send all the way to china so i kept it.",0
a bit chunky but soft  easy to see dog needs more reflector on collor for night,1
Works well for my little dachshund.,1
"I highly recommend this cat food. It has the nutrition I want for my senior cat and he loves it.  I know, I know it is expensive but I don't mind the cost when I see that not one pellet or morsel is wasted.  He eats it right down to the bottom of his bowl, licks his chops and looks around for more. Also, he seems to feel perkier and he sleeps better at night without waking me up. I can't speak highly enough about this food. My cat says, ""Yummy, Green Pea and Duck!""",1
"My dog loves this blanket! He would always try to take over mine that is made with this type of material, so I found him one of his own. Very well made, thick, and super soft. As soon as I put it on the bed my dog went straight for it and got comfortable. His a chiweenie and loves to get cuddled up under covers. The blanket is kinda smaller then expected but is good for our chiweenie.",1
I have always purchased Orthopedic mattress dog beds for my large Pitt Bull but this one really was a joke as far as comfort. The fabric was so stiff and the entire bed was not as I expected from the description. I returned the next day.,0
"I purchased this leash and was quite happy with it.  It seemed to be good quality.  At approximately 1 year, one side fell apart and I wrote to them asking if there was some asssitance that they could provide as I would expect that an item like this would last longer.  They responded that they could not provide any support, if I had the item for more than 30 days.  I think that is a very low bar and would not purchase again as I would expect any item to have a useful life of more than 30 days.  It is unfortunate as I was initially happy with the purchase but thought their response and efforts were very lacking.",0
"I could not tell from the photo that these mats have completely flat, smooth surfaces. The smaller mats work well for their purpose under food and water bowls, but the litter mats do not grab and hold any litter. Since we have four cats and have several food and water dishes throughout the house, I'm going to use the litter mats for additional bowl mats by cutting them in half. I may even use a piece as a mouse pad for my computer, although it may be too thin for that.",0
"PERFECT!! We are moving cross country with our cat and did not want a hard crate and when I found this I was excited.  We haven't moved yet but it is set up in the living room so the cat can get familiar with it.  I am optimistic that it will work well and also make overnights in a hotel much simpler.  It is well made, a great design and I would highly recommend it.",1
My dog (a 4 year old boxer) seems to like this brand. No problems so far.  Like the idea of ordering from Amazon----shipping directly to my home.,1
Unfortunately I am not impressed with this product. Am on 2nd month application and there are still fleas on my 2 cats. Waste of my money.,0
The XL Fits my pitbull perfectly!,1

Gabby who is our puppy mill rescue has become obsessed with this thing. Out of nowhere I will hear her tail thumping away at the sides or back of it. It definitely gives her a sense of security since she prefers to hide in it when we have company over. It has become her 2nd favorite spot (first being my lap of course). Our little boy Crusher enjoys hiding his toys in there and I have also found the two of them napping together inside of it on multiple occasions. So cute! Our old girl Lilli who is almost 14 has been found several times curled up at the very back of it. It is totally a hit! Such a great hidey hole.
I'm not sure why they don't advertise this for small dogs as well as I can see a lot of small dog parents really liking this.
I must say that it was super simple to put together since the zipper works perfectly. I really like how they put Velcro on the bottom of the pod and on the bottom of the cushion so when they are doing their scratching thing to ""make their bed"" they can't just flip the cushion out of it. We are all very pleased with this and I'm so happy that I was given the chance to purchase it at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1
My cats just love it! More than any of their other toys Ill have to buy another.,1
excellent!,1
The were a little salty for my taste. They are pretty good dipped in tarter sauce. Also way to crunchy.,0
I drive a scooter and my puppy comes to work with me everyday.  She loves her little backpack!,1
"My goats kept wasting all thier hay, this thing helps a lot, and the holes are small enough not to fear them getting head stuck@",1
Dog turned her nose up at everything but the sweet potato and she is not a finicky eater.  Would not buy these again.,0
"One of the hooks broke the second day, and my cat is skinny!",0
Best stuff ever for my springers!,1
"These are exactly what I expected and fit my pet safe fountain. Some people have questioned why they use them if they don't look bad when they change them. Carbon filters remove chlorine, sediment, some organic compounds, and tastes and odors from water. While these also serve as physical filters for things like fur and whatnot, most are things that you won't see. I continue to use them for my cat who has mild kidney issues and needs to drink plenty of water. I don't want anything like a funny taste or smell to deter him from doing so. I don't know if it makes a difference but it certainly can't hurt and it's cheaper than the vet.",1
"Not working!
I'm not sure whether the formulation has changed or what the problem might be.  I thought we'd used this before successfully, but both our cats were scratching excessively after the first use.  I found live fleas on both and am still finding them after a second, later dose.  I won't buy again!",0
Wonderful,1
"The first problem with this leash is that its a very stiff construction. If your dog is a puller, it will hurt your hand. I often wore one glove while using this leash to protect my hand. The biggest problem is that it totally quit working after one month. I do not recommend this leash.",0
Didn't notice any difference in cats ears after 5 days. Their ears were still very dirty. Also the nozzle caused it to spill everywhere every time I tried to use it.,0
I live in the middle of no where. So when I can't get frozen blood worms the freeze dried are just as good.,1
Miss Callie would eat part but never the whole thing. I guess healthy eating isn't her favorite.,0
"I assume I'm not doing something wrong, but it rarely picks up dog poo on the first try.  By the time I'm done its turned it into a mess.  Not a fan, going back to a rake.",0
Doesn't stay against the wall.  I'm always picking it up.,0
"Package arrived open one of the bottle was broken n leaked everywhere
I spray the second bottle however and my dogs came to lick my finger n was snapped dang the bottle
!!!! Useless product save ur money
Very upset with this purchase",0
"Already quit working, cheap quality, do not waste your time on buying!",0
This stuff has a very strong fish smell to it. My cat's did not eat it.,0
Great quality leash!  The reflective threading is a nice added benefit for our dog's leash for those early morning or late evening walks.,1
"First time I bought a toy like this ad my dogs have not left it alone, one of my yorkies has to sleep with it at night. Who would have know, a ball....lol...",1
Horrible clip.. I have a large dog. Hes a pitbull and he will shake his head and the clip falls off. After chasing my dog down the street I came home and had to cut the clip off and by a new one from home depot now it works great. I like the length thats why I purchased the leash. . If you have any size dog that likes to shake its head I would not recommend this item.  Unless you like to chase a after them..,0
Works great!!,1
"Collar seemed to be working in the beginning.  Then, it quit working after a very short time. The beeping occurs continuously for every noise around the house; not just my dog's bark.  Tried changing batteries.  Nothing worked.  We ended up getting a different collar.",0
"I was hopeful this would help with my older dog's flatulence issue.  Maybe his problem is caused by swallowed air or something else outside the scope of this product's range of uses.  All I know is that this had zero apparent effect on that.  He did not have any other symptoms that I know of, and nothing about his health seems to have changed by using this product.  As far as I can tell, it did not have any noticeable effect on the dog at all.",0
"I've tried special diets and medicines for my cat, and the poor little guy still had digestive problems (diarrhea). He took a packet of this daily and within one week he was perfect! We now only give them every other day and still no issues.",1
"both of my cats had a cold and this got it under control very quickly. it smells like maple syrup. I would just put a glob on my finger and stick it in their mouth, they lick it right off! I did it twice daily for about a week and they both felt better!",1
"""We love this dog bed! Very well made and fits the crate perfectly. Our pup is loving it and hasn't damaged it at all,even after tearing up her last bed. Great product and would recommend it to anyone!"" Neil, 2/4/2015",1
"Didn't work for us.  Our dog is a ball killer and this one is no exception.  He managed to get the plug out on the first night of play.  We got it back in, but on the second night he got it out again and killed the light.  I was surprised that it didn't survive.  It looks like a good design.

Our dog will put a hole in a tennis ball in less than an hour.  If this is your experience too, try another ball.

Now it's a daytime-only ball.

Looking forward to trying one that's totally sealed.  I don't know if he could kill one of those.",0
My cat loves to go for walks in his stroller. I wish it was a bit bigger as he's 20 lbs!,1
Good Fit on my Garmin Sport Pro. Has held up very well over 2 months in waterfowl hunting conditions. Still looks new,1
Great to have my Dog wherever I go.,1
junk. strap ripped as I was putting it together for the first time. returned. refunded.,0
my cat loves it. as soon as I shake the package she runs to me.,1
"My dog is an aggressive chewer when it comes to her toys. The Kong products are usually pretty tough and last a while before their destruction. That being said, this toy lasted a total of 10 seconds before the stuffing was ripped out. I accept the fact of my dogs tendencies with her toys, and I am not going to stop buying Kong products, but I will not buy this particular product again.",0
Easy set up. Great for small tanks,1
"Great for securing my dog when washing her, I do not care that it gets wet, since it is not leather",1
Leash was exactly what I needed and the price was reasonable.,1
Excellent!!,1
"It is to slow on feeding, for what I needed.  I stop the pump and filter for a half hour so the fish can eat the for without fighting the current. It take 2 hours for it to release all the food from the chamber.",0
I have been using Frontline Plus on my dogs for the last 9 years. But when I purchased this box of Frontline Plus it did not control any fleas at all. My doggies are covered in fleas and they are scratching and licking themselves raw! It is so bad they are having to wear e-collars. I really don't know which product to use now since Frontline Plus is the LEAST TOXIC of all the flea medications on the market today. I called Frontline and asked if they had changed their formula but the customer service rep said they hadn't. I told her I thought I had received a bad box because it had always worked in the past. She didn't seem to care! So I returned the unused tubes. I will not longer recommend or purchase Frontline plus ever again!,0
"I ordered this for a large German Shepherd that usually devours and tears up anything he is given to play with. This ball is a great size to prevent chewing so far, and he has a lot of activity herding the ball as well as chasing it.",1
Just not good.  These are NOT plastic nor 'heavy gauge'.  They are maybe 20ga metal and poked MY fingers just trying to get them out of the package.  Certainly not going to let my cats play with them.,0
I give these to my cats just once a day along with their food that his hairball formula once a day.  The dogs love these and think it's a treat.  I have not noticed nearly as much hacking as before.  I would recommend!,1
Works as needed and more durable than my last purchase from someone else.,1
Too small,0
"I really like the double-handle design. I give this five stars for quality and ease of use. I will make a recommendation though. If you have a dog that has not yet learned to walk properly without pulling, then you need to be extra careful with the handled grip. For our new 80-lb Shepherd, I always put my hand through the regular leash grip and allow it to wrap around my wrist and the leash to be held by my hand.  Both of these handles are wrapped around a PVC tube. It could be pulled out of your hand easily by an excited pup. Excellent leash, but be careful about your dog's ability to pull this out of your hand. Still, a very well-made product that I look forward to using!",1
my two dogs love these treats they are small for my small dog.,1
"This replacement tricked me because the large size is smaller than the large size by other manufacturers. I bought in anticipation of the next time I would need to replace the cover and discover it is too small. Of course now it's too late to return it. So remember check your dimensions. I thought I was reordering what I bought previously, but it wasn't the same thing.",0
These things are great. I love the fountain too,1
"The delivery was fast and good. The packaging of this item was poor for a liquid substance you should have packaged it better and properly so that upon receipt of the item the box would not be wet and none of the shampoo would have spilled out. Also what you receive is not what is advertised in this photo nor is it stated that a different item will be shipped. The color and smell are different than what is advertised. I bought this product because I loved the one that was ADVERTISED for my dog and I could no longer find it in PetSmart, I was delighted when I found it online, only to be disappointed upon receival because I didn't not receive what I was shown I was paying for. That is very bad for business!",0
Didn't fit my 55lb dog. It was cute tho I must admit.,0
cats didn't complain,1
Ordered a x-small and its to big for my 9lbs chihuahua mix!,0
It took about two weeks and a good snow before the yellow finches found the feeder with this nyjer seed. Now the yellow finches keep us entertained all day long. The cats love to watch from the window too.,1
"Finally, a dog cushion that has not gotten flat after a month.  My dog likes soft, and this cushion is soft.",1
"This collar was for my min pin and it would shock him when he would jump off the couch or go down the stairs.  We tried adjusting it to the lowest setting but it still went off without him even barking.  I do not recommend this product for a little dog, maybe it would work better on a bigger dog.",0
He LOVES these!,1
"Our dog almost died from eating this product.  Dehydrated, nausa, loss of appetite. Forunately we got her to a vet in time.",0
...should keep the birds safer in our yard from our cat.,1
it got stuck and i was not able to remove it,0
Didn't work for my dog.,0
My beagle did not like it at all!!,0
"I'm not one for reviews typically, but because I'm not going to return this so close to Christmas (also because it's not a high dollar item), I want to share that the quality is garbage instead and hopefully deter some buyers. It came with the beak ripped open, the color all over the place, and it smells horrible. I don't even want to give this to my dog. Next time, I'll spend the $5 at the pet store and get a much nicer version. They go through toys fast enough as it is, it doesn't need to come pre-damaged.",0
Very cute for my 8 lb Japillon.  yes Japillon.  I got the medium and it fit him perfectly,1
My dog ruined this bed in less than a day. Fell apart at the seams and ripped open. My other dog bed lasted over a year with no issues. Wanted to get him a new one for Xmas from the kids. Huge disappointment! Throwing it away!,0
"Good shampoo here. Clean scent and big suds.
Highly recommended.",1
"Its soo cute! My dog loves it, it's his new favorite toy",1
"Was expecting thicker CLOTH. It won't last., unless your kittens don't have claws or teeth. So will update my review. A cube you can buy at an ""unnamed store"" is made of the same material(not same pattern)  and did not last a week, but it was NOT produced by the same company. Don't spend this kind of money on a toy that will not last very long, even though the cats do love these. If you sew, you know the material this tunnel is made of, ""lining material for collars, ect"" .  I got a cat tunnel years ago, but it was made out of cloth , not this polyester ""lining"" material and it lasted for years.",0
"Great product, delivered as promised!",1
"Nicely done. Quality leather and work. Reasonable price.  Bought for an 80 lb Golden Retriever. Best for smaller dog.  I would prefer it to be wider, at least 1 inch.  Teeth marks in it the first week. Gave it a five star for what it is, but next time will get a wider heavier one.",1
"I got this carrier for my second cat so she could be buckled in for any road trips too. Its roomy for my 10lb cat, and I love the side zipper so I can stick my hand in to pet her without her trying to shove her face out to get out.

It didn't come with the shoulder strap though - the only reason I gave it one less star.",1
"Those red things under the bell attracts my budgies to this toy.
I don't know what it is about the colour red but they seem to like it.",1
"My Shih Tzu absolutely adores his greenies.  I've been feeding his greening for the past 3 years.  I'm so glad a did.  He's got great teeth, healthy gums and fresh breath.  No bad breaths for him because of this product.  Thank you Greenies.",1
"I purchased this background and it looks nothing like the picture.  The one I received was warped and nothing you could do would make the 2 pieces come together and look seemless.  There is a big gap...the background is not even long enough to prevent my fishes from swimming behind it. The ends have sponge but even that will not prevent my fish from swimming behind it. The review that's on here from another person also says there is a gap but they will cover with a plant...I do not want a plant.  When I tried to seem the 2 pieces  together I pulled the foam through so the gap wouldn't be that noticeable. It doesn't look too bad at that point...but...background is still warped and the length I ordered is 48"" as that is the length of my 55 gallon tank & does not touch the sides leaving the fish to be able to swim behind it. I will be returning as this is a waste of money! I've attached 2 photos to show the seam with the sponge shoved between it. .. I ordered the matching rocks too...very disappointed in this background.",0

"My corgi will not touch these chews.  She is normally not a picky eater, so I was really baffled about these.  With all these rave reviews, I was so surprised that my dog turned up her nose.  I was so looking forward to a treat she would enjoy and would clean her teeth at the same time.  Now I am stuck with a big box of treats she won't eat.",0
"My dogs love these and they seem like they are made out of quality ingredients from reading the package but it says in bold letters across the back, ""Must Be Refrigerated After Opening"". I don't know about you, but my dogs treats are kept in a certain area and they are not fed people food. Therefore, I feel it is sending the wrong message to be opening the fridge and giving my dogs a treat out of it since now they stand by the fridge expectantly everytime I open it and they are aware that that is where the people food is kept. It is very inconvenient to have to keep these in the fridge so I will not be purchasing them again. Also, the portion size is very small for the price.",0
"Very sturdy bowl, especially for those of us whose puppies like to pick them up and drag them all about the house!",1
Use it properly and it will be the best litter box you have ever brought. My boys love it and that's what really matters.,1
"Other than be completely adorable, this little house was the perfect size for my little hedgie. Chubbs loves her little strawberry home, and is more comfortable hanging out, outside of her cage now. It's also great because other little houses don't have a bottom so my hedgie can get cold, but this house does have a bottom, so she's cozier than ever!",1
"Bought it last winter for TNR cats outdoors, used it again this winter.
I like to think it keeps them a little more comfortable in their little Enclosure.",1
My dog liked it but when I'd kick it she would fetch it and shake it vigorously a couple times. It lasted less than a month before all the innards started coming out. And she didn't chew at it at all. Just a lot of money for something that has little durability.,0
"I got this grinder to use for a free nail trimming clinic because a lot of the reviews said it was quiet-- good for nervous first timers. However, it's only quiet because it lacks power. It has one speed setting and simply doesn't spin fast enough to actually work. Tried it on big dogs, small dogs, black nails, clear nails: useless. Didn't work any better on my toy poodle than on my GSD. Will be sticking with my trusty (but noisy) Dremel from now on.",0
I love it!! It's good quality and very sturdy.,1
"This is NOT a silent dog whistle. That has been stated on several other review. SHould have read them before I bought this useless ""whistle"". My dog pays it no mind at all.",0
Wonderful! My kitten is always wanting the water from the faucets. She loves her fountain. It is quiet and easy to assemble.,1
"Kitty doesnt really like these, but to each's own.",0
"I chose this item because it is both functional & colorful!  It fits my dog, Maddi, well & makes those hot days bearable for her!",1
"These are amazing, they work. It's like night and day.",1
"Very well made and sturdy. Easy to handle with my two small doxies inside. The only negative is that the handle, although adjustable needs to be able to come back more. When I walk my feet tend to hit the wheel bar when I walk. The handle is too close to the carriage.",1
My puppy (7 months ) is not a heavy destroyer of toys and this came apart in less then an hour .... yes he absolutely loves it and it's a great idea but the roap pulls apart quick,0
"I bought this for traveling, I take my dog everywhere and it is way easier to grad this and go. Fits all her treats and her dog food. Got the small one.",1
Purchased a small for my Shih Tzu puppy. It is way too big. We cant use it.,0
A go to toys for our puppy!,1
"I purchased this because I thought it would be good to use in my brood tank. But it cannot be used in a brood tank UNLESS you put a small mesh cover over the intake valve. If you use this filter with any smaller-sized fish you might have problems with the fish being swept up the intake valve. Further, to use the airpump on a surface lower than the tank requires a check valve. I'm not sure where you would purchase this, but the instructions say ""sold separately.""  I couldn't find it on Amazon. I ended up putting it in my Betta tank. My Betta seems to be doing well with it-mostly I think he just finds it interesting.
It is noisier than I would like-far from a ""whisper"". Probably wouldn't buy again.",0
great to have 1 bulb do it all,1
"I've been getting these sticks for my 5 month old puppy at the local store where I live, and while I love to support local it's costing me a fortune as she chews through these quickly.  I love that they are USA made and large enough for her to enjoy for some time, and at a great price (these are half of what I am paying locally).  I went back to reorder another package and they were no longer available, I hope they return soon!",1
Our dog couldn't be less interested in this toy. He has hardly given it a sniff. He's a GSP/lab,0
"The gate arrived in good time but the locking nuts are different to those shown on the box so took three of us some time to work out how to fix it into the doorway. However once we'd worked it out it was very stable despite being kicked numerous times by people stepping over it!

It kept my 2 Biewers and 1 standard chihuahua inside but our other smaller more wiry chihuahua worked out how to scramble over it in no time - she also worked out how to open the gate if we didn't close it properly with the spring lock.  What was good was that it kept the dogs in the kitchen but let the cats go in and out (over it) no problem.

A good buy but surprisingly hard to keep stepping over!",1
"Purchased this for my 5 lb Himalayan.  Usually use a competitor. My cat was bathed, inside cat, but I had seen a few flea eggs on her so I applied on March 29th.
By April 6th she was saturated with live fleas and eggs. She was bathed again and I applied another dose thinking the bath might have washed it off.
April 8th, she is saturated with live fleas and eggs.
I am going back to competitor. My cat means a lot to me and I can't tolerate fleas on her!
This is a major 'rip off'. They must be selling plain water instead of flea prevention.
She never goes outside and we have hard wood floors.",0
Our Pit/Lab mix had this toy for exactly one hour and it was chewed to pieces.  It is not as advertised and I certainly would not recommend it.,0
"Very disappointing. The wells under the flip-ups and sliders are too shallow to contain a worthwhile treat or amount of treat. The barrels are too easily cleaned out of, for example, peanut butter, while also impossible to clean of packed bread cubes and incapable of holding a looser filling such as kibble or training treats. The first time I managed to do something with it, dog spent about 90 seconds opening and emptying before settling down to a good chew on one of the barrels.",0
"I used this stuff when introducing our mean girl, Leia, to our new buddy boy, Merlin. There was some growling and spitting but for the most part they got along as well as unrelated adult cats could in an 8 week span.

They seemed to be going along so well that I decided the Feliway was useless and stopped buying it.

Well, I really should have kept using it, because the last few weeks all Leia does is growl and hiss at Merlin if he's anywhere within a 5 foot range of her. Like she has an invisible restraining order on him and if he breaks the boundary, all hell breaks loose. They still sniff each others butts, so I assume that's good - but holy cow, the growling! She always whined and growled, but not like this. I am thus forced to conclude the Feliway helped to relax her just enough to tolerate his presence without losing her marbles.",1
"I have 5 dogs, and I originally bought this bed when my dog was having puppies, so the mama could get away from the pups, but the pups could have a cozy place to lie, when mama needed a break.  So Although I do give this bed 5 stars, I should warn that if your dogs like to dig (like mine do), there is a ton of fuzz that comes up, which I pick up regularly.  Nonetheless my 5 little ones love this bed.  I have other beds inside, but use this one outside under my chaise lounge.  We live in Hawaii, so it takes a beating from the sun and rain and still holds up beautifully. I have had it for about a year and it still looks brand new.  So it's not a heavily padded bed, but nonetheless my dogs love it.  The only thing I wish was different is the fuzz factor. Even so, I'd buy it again, and in fact I'm getting ready to buy a larger size for my kitchen.  My dogs are all tiny, so I like having one bed they can all share together...and the love to rest their heads on the bolster side.",1
Great balls unfortunately my dog has massive jaw power so I only get two weeks per ball.  Great for the smaller dog.,1
Their favorite toy. Great for aggressive chewers.,1
"Seemed to be of good quality when received and inspected. However, it was ripped apart and unusable as a slow feeder in two weeks.  The webbing detached from the upper material and hangs open where the pony can just stick her nose in and pull the hat out. Would not recommend.",0
"Dogs love in, but they won't use the stairs so i removed it. I must now find or build a doggy ramp if i want them to sleep on top",1
"These are a lifesaver. My old dog is ill and can't hold his bladder very long, I thought I was doomed forever to be constantly cleaning my carpets. He can't get them off and I don't have to worry about him peeing all day while I'm working or out of the house",1
Perfect to withstand tough fang action :),1
"our kittens don't like the noise yet, but they will earn",0
I bought this a few months ago for my tiny babe - fits well only slightly loose - only used it a few times and the zipper broke! Can you please exchange it for me? I'm not happy to have spent a ton on a doggy rain jacket thinking I would have it for at least a few years and now I can't use it. What's going on Hurtta?,0
"The red line wasn't going past 60 degrees in warm water...when i looked close, there is a crack by the 60 degree mark-not allowing the red indicator line to rise above that...just got it today..has to go back.

Likely depends on the age of your pet and your own patience.,0
"I HAVE TWO LARGE BULLDOGS, 1 LARGE CAT, AND 2 SMALL KITTY'S.  I LOVE THIS FOR ALL OF THEM.  I MIX THIS IS ALL THEIR FOOD AND THEY EAT IT LIKE NORMAL.  WITH THE CAT/KITTY'S I ONLY USE A VERY FEW DROPS A WEEK AND THEIR COATS ARE SO SOFT AND SHINNY....AMAZING. NOW THE DOGS, ON THE OTHER HAND, AREN'T TOO FOND OF THE FLAVOR. THEIR PORTIONS ARE BY THE TABLESPOON ....IT'S TAKEN A LITTLE LONGER APPROX. 3-4 WEEKS.  I STARTING TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COLOR IS SHINIER AND THEIR HAIR IS SLOWLY SHEDDING LESS.",1
"Very sturdy, nice quality.  Don't waste money like I did the first time on something cheaper.  If you can afford it, this is great.",1
Delivered broken,0
"My dog loves these jerky sticks. He has severe allergies, so the limited ingredient duck and potato formula are super for him. Highly recommended for a sensitive doggie, who likes a good crunchy chewy treat.",1
"Stopped working within 6 weeks of purchase. The timer just stopped clicking completely. Yes, I put in a fresh battery, but that wasn't the problem. I figured this was a fluke and exchanged it with Amazon for a new one. Same problem -- broke again within a month.",0
"This thing lasts forever. We've had it for several months. About once a week, our pup will sit down and chew on it for a good half hour. Still plenty of hours left ahead.",1
"it is a great bed, but my Doberman doesn't like it because of the static from the cover/bed.  :(",1
"These are my cat's absolute favorite toy.

She bats them around quite often, but her favorite is to play fetch with them.",1
I gave one to each of my kids to keep in their car.,1
awesome,1
"This is great if you can put this near an outlet. The cord restricts you from putting this thing anywhere you want, but it works. The swivel turning thing inside makes sure that the dog food doesn't get stuck in the unit. That's a great feature.  Another wonderful thing is that the rats have not chewed through this plastic yet. I've been using this for nearly a year.  My Petsmart plastic auto feeder (another brand) was made of a softer plastic and the rats figured out that they can access the food by chewing through the plastic.  This hasn't happened with this feeder.

2017 Update. The rats have eaten through the plastic. I wish they offered this in aluminum with glass window. See photo. Rating adjusted from 5 stars to 2. Too bad there isn't a truly perfect feeder out there.

Okay. So I'm now on my second unit . I put a copper netting  sleeve on the machine. See photo. It MIGHT keep the rats from chewing it. I'm considering building an aluminum shield in the near future. The timer is really cumbersome, so I bought a Smart switch to automate it. The smart switch works without the included timer. See photos. I think I deserve at the minimum a partial refund or discount for all this hassle. I'd bump up the rating for customer service for it.",0
Did not work at all.,0
I like it a lot! Overall great product!,1
My cat loves it.,1
"could not be used for the purpose for which it was purchased.

68 pound lab no way.  for tiny small collars only.  infinitesimally lilliputian....would work on a toy stuffed poodle.  needs to come in several sizes and be labelled for the tiniest circumference of collars.  I contacted owner to complain and was not offered any return.  makes a good car keys holder...for one key and for $1.",0
The tank looks great however it's just a fancy bowl of water with no fish. Product picture shows 2 fish are included but there weren't any in the one I received.,0
"I have 3 cats. I have gone back to this on occasion because of the free shipping and the cost. However, I always regret it. I don't know if it's the large granules or just the stuff they make it out of, but it does not work with 3 cats. I have multiple litter boxes and they spread things out. It just does not work for me. I use another well known brand and that always works. They have a much finer litter. Not saying which brand as I don't want to seem like I am some paid user like so many others. This was absolutely the last time I buy it no matter the price or need.",0
Totally adorable . Got a size small for my male yorkie that's 7.5 lb.,1
"Fronts and yellow labs eat it right up!! What they miss, the bottom dweller feeders finish off....good value for the price.",1
"So very disappointed in this item.  Didnt even last an hour.
We recieved this item at around 6:30 pm when UPS dropped it off.
Very simple,  add water, plug in and there you go.
My pomeranian loves poured water so loved drinking from this for as long as it lasted anyway.
Within an hour of plugging it in it began making horrendous noises.  I unplugged it for the night
and plugged it back in this morning.  The water wouldnt flow.  Unplugged and plugged it
in again,  and it did start to flow but became extemely noisy again.  Also,  it seemed as
though the water wasn't lasting very long.
Thats when I noticed that the mat it was sitting on was soaked.  Needless to say that less than
24 hours later it is repackaged and at the Post Office to be returned.

What a disappointment for us,  My pup was so happy with it for the few minutes he was able to use it.
Great Concept but terrible product.",0
my dog's  and cat need these pupcorns daily all you have to do is say you want a pupcorn and they starty begging and doing tricks for them befor i even get them down.,1
VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY E COLLAR. I received mine after my other one got a hole in it and the new one has a hole too!! It deflated over night and got so low my dog was able to get it off and get to his stitches and pulled one out. The photo is from the morning to show how flat it got by squeezing the middle completely closed.,0
"This is probably a very good product in terms of what it does; the problem is getting it into the cat. My cat absolutely hated it. I tried opening the capsules and sprinkling the contents onto his favorite food and mixing it in as directed, and he refused to eat it. I then tried hiding them in pill pockets, which he also loves. He at the pill pocket and spit out the capsules. Next, I tried dissolving it in his milk, which he demands every morning. He tried to bury the milk, spilled it, and made a mess for me to clean up. Don't even suggest pilling him directly! I work in the veterinary field, and I pill lots of cats, but my own cat is impossible to pill. Dasuquin for dogs worked wonderfully for my Maltese, but I wasted my money buying this for my cat. I must say, though, that Nutramax stands behind their products. When I contacted their customer service department and explained my problem, the full purchase price was promptly refunded.",0
"The treats smell exactly like a bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich!  These have been my Old English Sheepdogs favorite treat for 6 years!!  Feels awesome to support a small bakery in the USA :)",1
"Got it put it together, plugged it in then unplugged it about 2 hours laiter to program collar to remote pressed reset button it lit up but I forgot to connect the remote and now I can't get the collar on or to connect to remote I thought it might have been cause it was dead but it's been on the charger for a day and a half and still nothing. Remote works grate!",0

"This order was not what I normally get.  It was a box of individually wrapped knee caps from a completely different company.  This is the second time that I ordered Country Butcher 50pk Knee Caps (which I really like) and have gotten 50 knee caps from a different provider (not as much crunchy stuff around the bone or individually wrapped smaller knee caps with less ""meat"").  Also the price changes EVERY month.",0
I thought I was going to love this stroller after doing research. I received the stroller in a damaged box and then after assembling it and hearing wheels lock into place took my dog on a walk. After 10 min the left wheel came completely off and now do not want to put my dog in it with a wheel that falls of.,0
"She loves it! I was surprised how large kick toys were, but it does seem just right for her back feet to kick at while hug attacking it. The tounge and the tail strings keep her interested. So cute!",1
Perfect.,1
My cat slipped out of it in less than two minutes. It takes zero effort to pull the clasp apart. Good quality materials but not worth your tim,0
Disappointed with product.  Inside liner does not stay put.  The four small Velcro patches are not enough to keep the liner in place.,0
"I love the bag but the zippers are low quality. Pros: Doors on both sides, zippered petting hole on the side, pockets for treats and pet documents, seat belt clips, removable bottom bedding cloth making easy to wash. Cons:the zippers started breaking on the third use.",1
My cats did. It like these,0
"I got this from some fancy natural pet store because the ingredients looked great. However, my cat hates it. Hes usually super food motivated, but hes barely eaten any. Hes not a fussy eater at all (you don't become a huge 20+ lb Maine coon by being one) it comes to dry food. Im pretty sure hes mad at me now. Hes making his hate known by finding all the treat containers and attempting to open them in my bed at 3 am. Total waste of money for us.",0
"Using it to eliminate chlorine from swimsuits.  So far, so good.",1
The booty don't stay on no matter how secured you pulled the straps.,0
"This is my second choice (or my dog's) after the salmon. He loves it, but, then again, he'll eat anything. However, my dog's coat grows in looking very healthy and his nails grow at a fast pace and overall he's a very healthy pup for being around 5-6 dog years. It's pricey but well worth it and this brand stays away from a lot of negative claims found with other brands.",1
"I have been meaning to write to express my disappointment in the Kitty Garden; I purchased the same product from a different vendor. I followed the instructions to the letter in terms of setting up and maintaining the garden. Although my two cats loved the grasses, they only survived for about 1 week before one molded, and the others 3 dried up and died. Even for 10 bucks, that was a pretty pitiful showing, especially since one of the reasons I got it was because of the reviews claiming the grasses ""last and last.""",0
"I've tried several slow-feed bowls for my lab. He usually finishes his food in 15 seconds (not kidding). Nothing worked and it was pretty frustrating. This bowl brought his feeding time up to 3 minutes! I love being able to recommend this bowl for clients with the same problem. Easy to clean, just throw it in the dishwasher.",1
For the first 4 months this feeder worked very well. Then it jammed and overfed our cats causing the motor to heat up and after that the product never worked correctly again. We had the timer piece replaced twice due to malfunction. Our auger dispenser broke due to the jam of the overfeed and the cats learned how to get their paws up in the auger and free feed themselves at all times. The bad news is that sadly this unit is not worth the money. The good news is that Ergo Customer Service worked with us to fully replace a whole new unit and two timer units.,0
"Love this spray it smells good and helps detangle my boys fine, fine wavy locks.",1
"easy to fill, easy to get into, easy to clean, rolls nicely on tile floor. I use it for storing feed for my ducks and geese.",1
Too small,0
This thing really works great. I used it in on a co2 generator(yeast/sugar/water) and it really saved me from shooting gun into the aquarium on top of it's already usefulness as a bubble counter. It's easily opened and cleaned which was very helpful for those types of co2 delivery systems. I'd definitely go with this one.,1
I got this as a gift for my puppy. It's so cute on him. We love it!,1
I HAVE TWO LARGE CATS.  THE CLUMPING LITTER I USE MAKES BIG CLUMPS AND UNLESS A SCOOP WAS USED TO BREAK THEM INTO SMALL PIECES  THERE IS NO WAY THEY WOULD GO IN CONTAINER BECAUSE THE OPENING IS WAY TOO SMALL.  SO WHY DO ALL THE TURNING OVER IF IT STILL HAS TO BE SCOOPED OUT AND THE WAY IT IS MADE MAKES IT HARDER TO SCOOP. HAD IT WORKED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL AND EASY BUT THE SPACE AT THE TOP OF THE CONTAINER ISN'T EVEN AN INCH.  I WAS DISAPPOINTED.  MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THIS PRODUCT.,0
Doesn't fit all bow front containers. This one didn't meet the edge of the tank,0
Ok poor fit ended up buying a more expensive better fitting coat for my dog:/,0
Too small - same size I normally purchase but ran very small,0
Never worked,0
Broke after a week. Couldn't believe it. Do not buy this product!!!,0
"This crate is easy to set up, although one of the metal bars was broken at the weld site.  My husband was able to fix it so we did not return it.  I like that it has a top zipper so if the dog is resists entering the crate, you can zip the front closed and put him through the top.",1
My dog loves these treats and like that they are made in USA,1
"LOVE this litter box!!  High sides makes ""less"" mess!
I received the color as shown.

Sender:  Item arrived on time, product as described.",1
Helps calm my dog tremendously during storms or even when she gets nervous.  I can't believe the difference!,1
"My dog did not like them.  I tried everything.  In the end, I had to puree and mix in wet food.",0
The white material is very thin. Worst couch cover I have ever bought. Almost see-thru in spots. It won't last long. I have other dog couch covers that have lasted 10 years. Dogs on them all the time and held up in washing machine. No wonder the price looked good.,0
"The product did not work, my cat is still scratching herself",0
Not nearly as thick and plush as the picture leads you to believe.  I could put a towel in the floor and have as much cushion as this has.  Very disappointed in it.  Would not recommend except maybe as a liner in a very large crate.,0
"I got no variety. I got 2 exactly the same, but saying that, they are Wire Haired Fox Terrier Proof! She has tried her hardest to kill the sqeak in this toy, but she hasn't succeeded in over as month! Usually I buy Kong toys that include 4-5 extra squeakers, I replace them at the end of the first hour, but this one both are still alive & squeaking!",1
Just walked by the bedroom door and saw my 7 lb schnoodle laying on her back and holding the antler in her paws like a baby with a bottle....she loves it. A good treat that last ...looks like ...forever.,1

"I purchased this brand after Googling for a natural cat food that would eliminate/reduce IBS for cats.  I have one 8yr old cat, who always had puked up her food undigested.  She was loosing weight, always hungry (which she let me know about all the time) and would also get bad excema on her skin in the winter (we live in OH, lots of snow and cold temps).  Both of my cats (other didn't have any issues) have now been on Natural Balance for 7 months and they absolutely love this food.  I switch up the type each time I order, giving them a variety of flavor.  I've also ordered the wet canned food to give them a treat 2 times a week on top of the dry.  Afterwards they talk all over the house and are so excited to share with me that they had a great meal.  My IBS girl now only has hairball episodes (few and far between), a shiny coat once again with no scabs and is super happy.  I highly recommend this product!",1
"I didn't even get to use it. It arrived to me completely shattered. There was absolutely NO protection for shipping. I am very disappointed. Like everyone else said, this thing is absurdly fragile.",0
It fell apart 1 month after I got it.  I've glued it several time finally used L brackets on it.  I would not buy it again,0
"Please stop selling this food.  It contains melamine which was recalled in October 7, 2009.  It is found in moist dog and cat food, canned dog and cat food, dry dog and cat food, dog treats and this food, 8 and 1 ferret food, which I have fed my ferrets for many years.  This food was not pulled from pet store shelves even tough it was recalled.  I urge you to stop selling this food on you website so that other ferret owners do not have to go through what me and my ferret just went through.  I had did not know why he was not feeling well.  I could not find this food anywhere.  It was taken off pet store shelves, I was able to order my last two bags from your site.  By the time I read this information it was too late, my ferret ended up having renal failure.  This information can be found on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website if you need the information. It is listed under the Melamine Pet Food Recall.  PLEASE STOP SELLING THIS FOOD!!!!

My dogs are getting use to it . . .  still but is functional perfect size and weight. worth it,1
Excellent,1
Cat is happy.,1

Awesome product!,1
"Simple to install, easy to remove.  Does not squeak or rattle and keeps my 55# golden and 20# shelties in place. I'm not sure about the longevity of the rubber ties but they would be inexpensive to replace if necessary.  My dogs aren't escape artists, I'm sure a truly determined pup could chew or work their way though but this product would work for most canine travelers.",1

"good quality, happy dog, what more can i say?",1
I have been using this product for 5 weeks now on our 8 year old American Staff Terrier.  We are on our second canister and unfortunately I have yet to see a difference in the limping and the struggle to go up and down the stairs.  I am hoping to see an improvement soon; container says 4-6 weeks.,0

My dogs love these! They never turn them down.,1
"Okay.  Dinnertime for puppies is always fun...but about these Kongs.

I bought 3 large and 2 medium Kongs for my puppy based on a recommendation from my dog trainer.  I stuff part of my pup's food into each of the Kong, freeze them, and BOOM!  The next morning or evening, they are ready for her to knock around the house

Kongs are tough and rugged for your super chewer's needs.  They are safe to stuff with some peanut butter, cheese, food and put in your pup's crate to keep her/him busy and interested in something for awhile.  She sometimes plays with it without food, but I think that she is just trying to find some remnants.  She doesn't sit down to chew on it if there is no food in it, but when there is, she spends some quality time with it!

Other reviewers have said that you will have to get used to finding little dog kibble everywhere...it's true!  And - FYI - if you freeze the Kongs, the dogs will work up a slobber on the carpet, which, when you step in the slobber/ice puddle, will make you think s/he pottied.",1
"This is my second two dog set and this one acts the same as the other one does, unfortunately.  I thought it was my numbness for the reason that the second collar wouldn't stay working, but my husband tried it and same thing.  The concept is great, but it just doesn't work for two dogs.  The plug in for the collars is in a bad place which is under the nylon collar itself.  It's hard to plug it in how it's designed.  It comes with only one plug so you have to charge one for 6 hours, then charge the other for 6 hours, then the remote for 6 hours.  It should at least come with a plug for the remote and the transmitter at least.  You can't correct your dog(s) right away because the transmitter goes to sleep, which it does say.  Like I said good concept, just bad delivery.  I am returning the collars because the second one doesn't work and I find it ridiculous that I only have one charger for three items that need charging.  I am purchasing a different e-collar.",0
"I have just ordered two more of these balls. I ordered the extra large, as I have a 124 pound German Shepherd who is a very aggressive chewer, as well a ten-month-old, 67 pound Belgian Malinois, who is also a crazy chewer.

These balls are virtually indestructible. They charge very well in the indoor incandescent lighting or if they happen to take them outside the sunlight really charges my bright green.

"I'm not quite sure what to do about this seed. It looks like a nice blend except for all the corn and there is a ton of it! It just goes on the ground and our nightly rabbit eats it. My concern is that when the weather warms and other wildlife come along, like skunks, they will enjoy the corn as well. Not a good thing. I liked that the sunflower variety of both black oil and striped was very nice and plentiful. If it wouldn't be for the corn, I would be stocking up.",0

"It looks good. But it is incredibly cheap. Has a system of thread bolts in order to screw in each rope wrapped piece (which is brtal on your hands to screw in without gloves) That are prone to falling out of the particle board flat pieces of the structure.  I could never get the tower anywhere near that high. It did not survive assembly and the two top ""beds could not be attached. Attached one on one of the flats below, and the other one simply is not used.

Now with that said, at that lower center of gravity... it is doing well enough. I have 3 inside cats, two females, one of which is high energy tabby and loves to run, who will fly into the thing from ground level and launch herself, and a full sized male who chases her, and between the two of them they put a good amount of abuse into the tower and it is holding up. However, Under both of the flats I have had to add extensive support. One side by pressing into a corner, and even adding a makeshift prop. The other side has a small cage placed under neath it. If those two items were not there, it is likely it would have already broken by now. Perhaps not, but likely.

So, for the money I paid for it, I found it a good value. However, I do regret it, and would have liked to have something much sturdier, even at expense of height. Just know, its cheaply made, and you will have to reinforce it. If you are ok with that and can get it cheap, it might be worth a go. Otherwise save for something better.",0
Bought this for my aging terrier mix thinking it would be perfect for her to stretch out. The bed was way too tall and lumpy once she laid down. My dog weighs about 13 lbs but likes larger beds. The small size was too small and medium was way too big. Dogs weighing above 30 lbs may like this better. This one was expensive and lower quality than I expected. The print and cover were made of nice canvas.,0
"Best harness we have ever purchased for our dog.  Easy to put on, snap, and it sits far enough behind the front legs so that it doesn't chafe.  Stands up to wear.  This is the first one we have purchased from Amazon which was a little more expensive than the first one we bought in a pet store while on vacation.  Would highly recommend.",1
"They ain't lyin' when they say ""heavy."" Can't even use them with the Halti because it pulls their heads down so much that they're annoyed and won't walk. BUT they can't be chewed through so once we aren't pulling while walking, I think these will be useful.",1
"My dogs favorite activity, like most dogs, is to destroy toys. I get so tired repairing them all. I have yet to have to repair this toy so it is worth the money.
Either buy a thousand cheap toys and have to keep fixing themor buy a tuffy toy and not have to worry about it for a long time. If you think about it you will be saving money. I recommended this line of dog toys for anyone who has jaws as a dog and i recommend this seller.",1
Excellent for ear infections!,1
Medium is a Perfect fit for 48lb dog!!,1
"This table is perfect for what I need it for.  I'm not a professional groomer, but I do groom my 3 dogs & some friends dogs. I went back & forth on which table to get because I was worried about size & whether or not the table would be large enough for my 100 lb Goldendoodle.  He fits on the table perfectly & can move around a bit.  The table legs fold down for easy storage.  The legs are sturdy & lock in place.  The basket that holds equipment was bent when the table arrived, but still works & is handy to keep supplies close while grooming.  I'd definitely purchase this table again.",1
Dog Vader loved these. I just wish he wouldn't pick at the fuzz all the time.  Great for play time.,1
"With 9 rescue cats, I've tried a lot of different kinds of litter. I look for a lot of different things and this wins at some and really stinks at others. I have asthma and allergies and I read an article talking about how the cats are bothered by the dust as well - and they're exposed to it more than we are.

Clumping -- This is not the strongest or the weakest at clumping. They tend to fall apart when you are trying to sift out the excess litter.
Odor Control - I don't think this does much for odor control at all. That whole 7 day idea seemed like a joke, My house smelled worse than with any other litter I used (except the nosorb I had to use for medical purposes for a little while).
Dust -- It is absolutely dust free. I never saw that poofy cloud and I haven't noticed the residue of dust in the room(s) with litter pans. Other litters would coat everything with a fine layer of dust -- and I would get it in my nose as well - so that's a big plus.
Tracking - It seems about average to me. It doesn't stop tracking entirely - but it's not worse than others either.
Weight -- This isn't billed as lightweight and it isn't. This is the heaviest litter I've ever used. Scooping the litter feels like a workout -- and that isn't even taking into account hauling the box around to refill.

All in all, I don't think this is the perfect fit for us but it m ay work if you on;y have one cat and don't mind the heavy lifting.",0
"Ths is definitely not waterproof, dog stain actually went in the ""waterproof"" cover of the foam. When I cleaned it, I actually saw water dripping out of the foam. This is at most water resistant l, not waterproof. Your dog will love this product, but it is not memory foam; it just seems like a cheap foam.

So the conclusion is that the original price is probably fake, and the description of the product is also misleading. I do like the design; it is just that I only bought this ""waterproof memory foam"" bed for my dog because my friend kept saying that I was abusing my dog for NOT buying her this bed while in fact, this is just another dog bed.

I hope Brindle offers a replacement foam, because mine is obviously ruined.",0
It is too painful and cruel.,0
Exactly as advertised!,1
Tried it for a month didn't notice a difference,0
"This product really works!....But the four triple A batteries used to power the spray wear out in about two weeks. To this end
we purchased a set of rechargable batteries to keep the Scat working.",1

"It has a noticeable odor that my two cats do not like, even when mixed into their favorite canned food.  I'm donating both containers I bought to an animal shelter. I'm buying the other odorless Lysine powder supplement that my vet sells.  I didn't know Lysine powder supplements for cats could have such varied formulas where some have odors and others are odorless. Lesson learned.",0
"I have a cat that  chews on everything.  Concerned she would  end up at the vet again, I decided to try this.  So far so good, I have not found any more silk leaves pulled off or pieces of paper chewed on.

It runs out of battery really quickly and after a while my dog got used to it and it didn't work for him anymore.,0

"Great little mat. Fits perfect in the crate/kennel. It is a little thin in my opinion, but overall it is a fine product.",1
"I purchased this pen after my Chocolate Lab had knee surgery and needed to be kept immobilized for 8 weeks.  We already had a large, heavy-duty kennel that would be fine for her, but with her ""cone of shame"" on she was unable to turn around in it because it was too narrow.  While this pen wouldn't be a suitable replacement for a real kennel, it certainly did the job I hoped it would- mainly keeping our dog enclosed while still having enough room to get comfortable.  Also nice is that the shape of the cage is totally versatile.  It has 8 individual panels, so you can adjust to fit your needs.  Our lab's bed is circular, so I set it up as an octagon.  If you need more room you can purchase 2 and connect the ends and have double the space.
The pen is very light-weight, folds easily, and even comes with a carrying case making it very mobile.  The downside to this is if you're trying to keep a rambunctious dog contained, it would be very easy for them to push/lift the cage and fairly easily escape.  Also included, though, are a handful of anchors that can be pushed into a lawn (kind of like tent stakes) to keep it in one place when used outside.
The door is probably the biggest disappointment.  The latches are pretty much useless- they barely hold the door shut and any small bump can easily dislodge them and open it up.  I just took one of the clips that are meant to hold the ends together and secured the door with that.  We end up not using the door anyway since it's easy enough to just disconnect the end panels and create a wider opening with nothing to step over for our invalid pup.
Overall I'm very happy with the purchase as it's doing the job I needed it to do.  If you're relying on this as your everyday enclosure for an energetic dog, you're gonna have a bad time, but for my drugged up, cone-headed, gimpy dog it's been a lifesaver.",1
"This a a bunch of thin wires with some cardboard on the end. When I dangled it  for my cat, he went after it and started biting the cardboard ends - but I was afraid he was going to hurt himself on the wires if the cardboard came off or if he got hit in the eye with it. I think it would also be dangerous if you had small children around. I threw it away.",0
"I have a 1-year old Bengal cat that is in to everything. It's like having a little puppy. She especially likes to tear at her toys, or whatever other fabric, paper or cardboard item that's in her path. She's also very dominate and can at times pester my other cat relentlessly. I've been using the Feliway products for about 6 months and they have worked wonders. I would highly recommend this product.",1
I really loved the price 3x cheaper then my old one and beautiful shapes/colors but if you are getting this for a small pet I highly recommend the circle its the only one in size small!!,1
I scuffed up my Tony Lamas before getting smart and ordering this boot jack. Easy to remove boots but more importantly protects toe and heel.,1
"my boyfriend and my's cat is a prissy little princess and is fairly hard to please (also, she's 8 years old, so she's definitely no longer in playful little kitten mode), but she has finally warmed up to this toy. at first she didn't quite understand it, but placing a treat underneath the ball in the track, making her have to paw the ball out of the way in order to get to the treat, worked pretty effectively after just a few days. whereas in the first couple of days it was a battle to keep her interested in it, we can now hear her playing with it while we're in the other room.

like i said, she's a little sassy thing that is too good for most toys, but i'm happy to say that she's warmed up to this one! 5 stars :)",1

It is like the mesquito citronella oil poured in a room, the odor is onerous, I put it on our cocker Christmas Eve next thing I know Junior is miserable, the kids, husband and I feeling naseus, no kidding. It took candles and ceiling fans to get smell tolerable, while I stopped all family functions to wash poor Junior, who I was so worried must also have a headache. Awful. Hope this helps someone! I cannot even imagine to have this smell around babies! Unless a person is ok with like a strong overspray of musk cologne... then this is how it is with this product.",0

"This fence doesn't phase my small pug. She ran out of the yard on day 2. Got her back and figured part of the wire may have been covered too deep. I tested the fence by walking around the perimeter and it buzzed all the way around the yard.

Got her back again and repeated my test. Turned up the range as high as it would go.

When I came home tonight she was gone again. The shock she gets from getting near the fence isn't enough to keep her from walking through it.

I do not recommend this fence. I previously used the sport dog system which works fine. I got this one because the sport dog collar looked insanely big for a small dog. But at least it works",0
Excellent for all cat owners!,1
This is the product that I give to my cat at the recommendation of her vet. It has helped immensely to allow her to jump to her place in the window. I would recommend . It works.,1
Dog likes it.,1
This is a very well built product. Unfortunately my dog won't use it as he is having issues with steps.,1
"This collar is just what you need! I have three dogs ranging from 50 pound female husky, a 70 pound male vizsla and a 90 pound male lab so as you can imagine at times it can get noisy at my house! My lab is the main problem b/c he gets the other male going!! This collar fits snuggly on all three of my dogs and the aspect I love the most with this collar is that there is an adjustable sensitivity. I have purchased collars in the past where the dog could move and the tags on their regular collar make the barking collar go off and my dogs would be afraid to move, but rest assured this collar is not like that at all. This also comes with a nice toy which all my dogs have loved :) I also like that there are two size prongs that come with this collar for my lab and husky with longer fur I used the longer prongs and for my vizsla that has more like hair I was able to get away with using the shorter set. This collar takes one battery which is a nice feature as well. I will be purchasing two more so all three of my dogs can have their own!

I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",1
Love it. Hate how expensive it is. My dog has liver cancer and this along with his chemo seems to be helping.,1
"My four cats love this!  The only thing they don't like about it is that they end up fighting for control of the little house.  My cats are average size 12-13 pounds and they find it big enough.  The platforms could be a smidge bigger but they use them anyway.  It was very easy to assemble and is quite sturdy enough though I do have it placed in a corner next to a wall.  All in all, there is someone in or on it just about all the time.  I attached a few toys to it--one provided and another feather toy and they enjoy batting them around, too.  Quite happy with the purchase.",1
"Bought this for my 2 dogs so I didn't have to refill their water all of the time. Unfortunately it only worked properly for about a day. I've used this for about a month now. The spring doesn't work right to allow the water to automatically come out of the reservoir into the bowl. I either have to jiggle it, twist it back and forth, or completely remove and replace the reservoir. My dog is constantly letting me know he is out of water. Food dispenser works amazingly! Just wish the water bowl worked too. Will be looking at purchasing a different bowl soon. Not too happy that I pissed  away $35 on a worthless item.",0
"I tried to use these but the blades are too wide to fit comfortably around dogs nails.  Bad design.very bulky, thick blades.",0

"The product that was advertised was different from what I received.  The product advertised was ""LeBistro"" and I thought I was getting an exact replacement for the LeBistro I originally had (but that needed to be replaced). This feeder is adequate, but I was disappointed not to receive the advertised product and one that I was used to.  This feeder ""accidentally"" drops several pieces of dog food during the day and one day it came on when I walked into the room.  Also, the tray doesn't fit very well.  :(",0
"Grass doesnt stay in the container, the cats are able to pull it right out and make a mess everywhere. Also they can pull the green lid off which makes an even bigger mess. Grow it in a pot or something larger for the kitties to eat. Else youll have a mess to constantly clean up.",0
Very pretty tag. It sure takes a beating and still looks nice.,1
"My cat has been so much more like her usual self since I started using this product - back to being very friendly and cuddly. She stopped meowing for hours and licking tons of her fur off. Our vet recommended this, and we have been very happy with the results - this is the fifth time I've bought it. I go through one refill every 3-4 weeks, I'd estimate.",1
"Darn it! I didn't think my rave reviews of these dog bones would make all these awesome bones sell out!
These are so different from other dog bone treats!
The shank bones are my first choice.  These are second.
They are actual bones and shipped frozen.  My girl can smell them or something (dogs are supposed to be really talented at smells;) She really barks when they're delivered, above and beyond the customary one or 2 barks when other deliveries arrive.
This human can smell them after I open up the box.  They smell like a dinner from a great barbecue restaurant. Seriously!  This for a dog? Those other bones smell kind of bad to me.
I really hope they get all the bones back in stock! Can I get a pre order?

Shhhh!  Pretend you didn't read this other doggy people;)",1

"I thought this would be a great idea, put it on the back porch for emergency use and not have to run the dog out in foul weather. It turned out to be a trendy gimmick. 1) It is way too small to be useful. My dog is about 15lbs and didn't have enough room to sit comfortably on it. 2) She was not interested, not even a sniff, just not a substitute for real grass.  3) Emptying and cleaning is a real hassle.  Where the drawer looked to be useful, the turf is thck and liquid does not drain through the turf completely. Having to remove both the turf and the drawer to clean and deodorize is really more work than just a quick trip in the rain. It was so hard to get her to use it before, I doubt she would go near it after being disinfected. Save the $45 and go outside.",0
"My puppy loves it. So this feedback isn't about the food itself. Food quality is top notch as far as I can tell. And the fur somehow softens too during this past month.

So this was a repeat order. But I'm none too happy with the shipment of the second order. The bag had a huge slice/tear inside the box and the food pellets scattered all over as I opened the box and picked up the giant bag out of the box. Not sure what's going on, but pretty sure when this happened, it must've happened in the warehouse and not during shipping/delivery.

In any case, this would've been a 5-star if it weren't of the giant mess I had to clean up.",1

"Purchased this for my cavalier puppy and it has been a huge help! At first we just had an EX pen set up on the kitchen floor with disposable pads but she was tearing those apart. Then, we tried having her just use the kitchen floor and that was a nightmare as well. With this pad the pee dries quickly so I don't even see it unless she pees recently and it is much easier to clean up her # 2's on here daily vs. right off the floor. I usually wash this every 3 days or so and it does not smell inbetween washings.",1
Great product and a good price.,1
"NOTE: the blue dye of this coat leaks OFF OF the coat. The company admitted to me in an e-mail that that dye is unsafe. So if you want a possibly toxic dye leaking into your dog's fur and skin, go ahead and buy this coat. I double-dog dare you.

I tried the coat out and then let it drip dry in my bathroom. Now, I HAD noticed when I wet the coat and wrung it out (per the instructions) that there was some blue dye from the coat in the sink, but I just thought it was one-time/new coat thing. The coat was too big for my dog (in spite of measuring per their instructions), so I just left it to try over the shower bar. Later, I went back in to find blue dye ALL
OVER my tub. This was...bad. It just kept dripping off the coat for hours. Literally, hours. I contacted the company. More on that below...

Also, the sizing chart is misleading. My dog is 70lbs, so this size coat is recommended. But his measurements fit 2 DIFFERENT smaller coats. But the site says ""If unsure, go larger."" So I did. Well, this coat was WAY, WAY too big for him, and there was just no way to tighten it enough.

And that's the 3rd issue. It could've been made to fit with another 8-12 inches of velcro.

The coat stayed cool for more than FIVE hours...and it is VERY lightweight, but you'd have to be OK with putting a toxic substance on (and into) your dog.

I e-mailed the company about the above issues. They wrote:
""From the sizes you gave me I would say your dog is a size 18 or 20 as he fits into the girth and neck category for both.""
- except their 20 size says it's for a 45lb dog and mine is 70lbs. Which says to me that their sizing chart should be breed specific.
Regarding the dye, they wrote:
""Our Ultimate Cooling Coat is safe to use as directed, however we do not recommend your dog chewing or ingesting the coat.""
- Which sounds to me like an admission that it is toxic.",0

"this was a ""commonly bought with..."" item to an elephant ball popper I had bought for my daughter.  The ball popper only comes with 4 balls so this seemed like an obvious choice.  Unfortunately, these balls are smaller and lighter than the actual ball popper balls size so they do not work well (they are so light they can't stay in the popper rotation and bounce out meaning more work for me to pick them up and put them back for my child who still has yet to grasp that concept..).  Basically a waste of money.  It was an add on item for a few dollars so not worth the hassle to return but I would not purchase if I had the choice again.  For any of those who are considering buying this, know the balls are not standard ""ball popper"" size.",0
"Definitely not for long trips. It is not a large size! My cats weigh about 14 pounds and this is really too small for them. It's fine for the short trip to the vet but I'd feel bad keeping them in it for longer. They can't stand up in it or easily turn around. Also, my cat was fighting it at first and it made the whole bag leap.  Lastly, as other reviewers have said, shoving a cat through the front is near impossible - it would be much better if there were an opening on top.
It does have a cozy bottom, and when it first arrived, I left it on the floor and one of my cats napped in it for a few days. Of course, now that we've been to the vet and they know what it's for, they won't go near it!",0

"Not crazy about this brush. I have used it twice and it cut my hand pretty good when it brushed across it by accident. The clean out part works great but the wires on it are so sharp, I worry about what it is doing to my dogs skin if it cut mine that badly.",0
"Our Mini Schnauzer arrived in our home on November 2. The breeders had purchased this at a local shop for the litter as a starter food. After checking ingredients ( a must in our opinion), we decided to use it. There have been NO DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS OF ANY KIND with this food. We recently ordered the 40+ pound bag from Amazon because he does so well on it. We will purchase from this company again without hesitation.",1
"My dog easily chewed through the in less than an hour. It's cheap, but still not worth it.",0
Now I can throw the ball over the house my border collie loves it. She gets to run twice as far now. It's kind of long but it fits on top of the frig.,1
"It's great that the habitat came in double boxed and assembled.  However, the wheel is so squeaky and loud that I had to remove it after a day.",0
"The best item I have purchased for pets in a while. I have two dogs that I walk daily. Trying to control them with two retractable leashes was difficult. I put this new leash on the little guy, and have my hands for the control of the big dog. Works very well for me!",1
"too hard to fill, the top is just for cosmetic reasons. odd design",0
"I would never buy this again and would strongly recommend you use ANY other water bottle.

Cons:
Leaks
Drinking Straw is not Centered
Thin Plastic
Poor Design

I've had it now for a couple weeks and have yet to put it in the cage as it leaks non-stop! It's been living in my sink as I play with the tubing/etc. to try and remedy this. Cheap bottle that is sucking up my time and energy. Not worth the price.

When I screw the top on, the drinking tube sticks out to one side rather than facing the flat side as it should! Making it impossible to screw on tightly and actually use the bottle. I've remedied this with some plumbers tape and by not screwing it on tightly.

Pros:
Great idea!
Bracket feels indestructible!

Bracket is very tight and well made in comparison to the bottle. I imagine it would work well if the bottle were of higher quality.

Overall not worth the pain.

Pictures show how the bracket holds the bottle and how the tube is still off center EVEN with the plumbers tape. It was sticking out to the side before the tape.",0
"I ordered this pet toy for my 2 rabbits.  I'm not familiar with rope toys but since the description says that it will work for dogs, cats, and rabbits, I thought I'd give it a try.

Upon receiving the product, I thought it looked nice,  and it even felt nice.  It's not very big though,so it will probably only work for small dogs and cats.

Being a responsible pet owner,  before I gave this to my rabbits,  I decided to look up if they should or should not have a cotton rope toy.  Since most all other toys for them are wooden or edible.  To my surprise,  they should not have cotton rope for numerous reasons but the basin one being is that cotton rope does not break up which can cause severe gut entanglement and intestine issues!  Scary stuff.  I don't know what I'd do if something like that had to happen! !

So for false advertising and endangered of my bunnies I need to give this 1 star.  If I had bought it for a small dog, I'd probably think differently though.  Hopefully they update their description so no one else thinks this is safe for rabbits.

I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  Please research before giving your pets any type of toy.",0
"Our six year-old black Lab had gradually developed a serious case of large, white, dandruff-like flakes that stubbornly resisted brushing and washing.  Her problem disappeared completely within a few weeks of adding this Anchovy Fish Oil to her food daily.  We have re-ordered several times now, and are very satisfied with this product.",1
"Unfortunately the zipper to zip on the bottom broke in less than 2 months, so now it's useless! Cannot recommend",0
Its the biggest dog bone I've ever seen!  I can't wait to give it to my Cane Corso!  I love it!,1
This thing is tiny. The pics make it look big but it is as small as a regular bathtub rubber duck. Very disappointed especially considering how expensive it was.,0
"I don't recommend these, not only do they seem to make no difference in my cats behavior but recently the collar got stuck in my cats mouth causing him to throw up and drool all over himself. The collar was stuck and he was unable to open or close him mouth, he now has a sore on his jaw from the incident and cant eat hard food from the soreness.",0
I use this bin for the cat litter and the smaller one for the cat food. Its the perfect solution to get rid of messy bags that topple over. The wheels make it super convenient and easy to use.,1
"Cute bowls, the metal keeps the water cool!",1
I have Yorkies so don't give them the entire stick at once. I cut them into about 6 pieces. My dogs LOVE these and will do anything to get one. My dogs are not puppies but of all the chew treats I have tried these are the only ones they like. They will not eat your typical dog bone treats. If you buy  these at Petco they cost twice what I paid for them here and I had them within 4 days.,1
This didn't even last 10 minutes with my two dogs.,0
I bought these for our dogs to use in their houses in the winter. They haven't said a word about them but they haven't chewed em up either. I take that to mean they like them,1
"I guess my kitties are not impressed with mussels and squid.  They nibbled a bit, but had as little enthusiasm for this as they did for the Bora Bora sardine cutlets.  It was kind of gross looking to me.",0
"Too weak to get the job done, get a Dremel",0
Didn't fit well on cage. Very messy.,0
Good product for keeping the dog comfortable while in training classes.  Only drawback is that it gets hot inside.  Especially problematic on hot days.,1
"Sort-of my fault.....the disk size is small....should have read deeper into the dimensions of this small disk......and its a PLUSH toy with a squeaker......did not remember seeing that in description, but could have been....Our dog dosen't do plush....it may last a day....Guess we paid for the Saints Logo.....LOL....be careful and not just go by picture. NOT for a Border Collie with the ol' sissor cut teeth....not sure what I mean...ask a Border owner....it is what it is....just a so-so PLUSH toy for your Yorkie.
Update, 06-05-15......toy is history....made worse than I thought. The ropes ends are under one of the star points, with electrical tape on each end, held in with a few low quality threads....had to trash it.....junk",0
"My dog is young and still likes to chew, but still I thought this would last longer. The original cover was chewed up within minutes so I decided to return this one. The even bigger disappointment was, when I returned it, I was charged shipping. So, I got $2 back from an unused item. I would recommend not buying this product or the AmazonBasics Elevated cooling bed.",0
Our pup has a permanent scar (hair not growing back) from where this rubbed her skin raw on her legs.,0
"ball was much smaller than the previous one I purchased,
It was not marked as mini.",0
I ordered this directly from LitterMaid and paid way too much money for it.  It arrived broken.  And LitterMaid's customer service is horrible.  They are of no help - I have an expensive broken litter box.  Do yourself a favor - avoid this poor quality product from a company that simply doesn't care.,0
"The kennel alone was not enough for our Bella.  She is under 10 lbs, so the kennel keeps her safe from cyotes, however the SunBlock top was needed to protect her from hawks in our area, and, of course the sun.  She can now enjoy lounging in her safe kennel.",1
As described.,1
We love the noise they make and they look real.  The cats love these mice,1
These are great for dog shows or when you want to convert a wire crate into something more private for the dog.  Washes easily.  Most inexpensive cover I found.  Only color is black but add a colored name tag and you have your dash of color!,1
"Similar to the previous customer's review, my bulb replacement arrived broken as well.  The package contained no bubble wrap and had one small (very small) piece of newspaper in the box which served no purpose given the larger size of the container.  The bulb arrived in millions of pieces...literally.  Extremely disappointed!",0
"This 48 x 36 x 76 cage actually costs $2,879.99 on their web site.
A not so enormous 24"" X 22"" cage costs $1,189.",0
"Used to be good, but now large nut meats are just pulverized and unrecognizable. Peanuts, which are often contaminated with aflatoxin and toxic to parrots now figure prominently in the ingredients. There used to be far more cashews and almonds. Peanuts are now the second ingredient.",0
My dogs love them.,1
Great bowl for our elderly cat. She's loves it.,1
"This collar was suggested to me by my dog walker and I love it!  I I have now purchased 5 in different sizes; one each for my two guys, one for the neighbor's dog, and I purchased two extra for my dog walker to use in a pinch with other dogs he walks.  It gives absolute control without the choke factor.  Whereas my little dog was getting out of both his regular collar and a harness (no matter how much I tightened them), he cannot escape with this!  He is safe and there is no pain inflicted on pulling like the old choke collars.  This collar has probably saved my dog's life and my sanity (no more chasing him in the streets, while he is scared and running right into traffic, dodging cars after slipping out of other collars)!!  So very glad this collar was recommended.  And the price is way cool.",1
"My dog is a Chow mix and even with haircuts, he still minds the summer heat, especially since most of our residence is carpeted.  I've been struggling to maintain a decent balance between his comfort and my electric bill so I started doing some research on cooling pet beds.  I wanted an elevated bed (not one of those you have to fill with water) and the Coolaroo brand received the most positive reviews from what I could tell.  I decided to order the large size even though my dog is around 40-45 pounds.  After I first ordered it, I was disappointed because it wasn't scheduled to be shipped for four or five weeks.  Within a week or so from my order date, however, I received another email that it was to be shipped in the next few days and should arrive in around ten days from then.  I got the package today and was curious how my dog would take to it since he hasn't really liked any dog beds in the past (I had previously bought and returned at least four different fabric/stuffed beds before I found one he liked and would get used to, even though I still had to hide it in his blanket for a few weeks before he'd actually lay on it itself).  As soon as I put the pieces out on the ground to begin assembly, my dog laid right on the fabric on the floor and wouldn't get up.  After I coaxed him up (with treats), I was able to assemble the bed without too much difficulty.  The picture instructions that were enclosed are slightly confusing (I couldn't figure out from the pictures which sides the foot pieces went on, if the flat screw hole should be inside or outside).  But I watched the how-to video on YouTube first, which was a great help, and it wasn't so bad.  I had a little difficulty keeping everything lined up when working on the third and fourth legs, but eventually managed.  It probably took me about 15 minutes from start to finish, including watching the video, and with two people it'd probably go a lot faster.  My dog was watching from nearby and before I could say okay, do you want to come try your new bed?, he was already up on it.  In fact, he's been there ever since.  And he also hasn't been panting like he usually does when lying on the carpet or other dog bed.  Plus, there is enough room for my second dog (a 40 pound Heeler mix) to be up there, too, if he wanted, but they don't care to lay together or even touch each other, so I'm not sure they'll try it.  All in all, I am very satisfied with all aspects of the purchase including cost, delivery time, size, assembly, and how much my dog likes it.  It's also nice that additional covers are sold separately in case anything happens, too.  I may have to order a second one to actually use outside.",1
price is right. I had to order an xl for my corgi so the sizing is definitely off.,1
"Fortunately, I bought the Shred Pal at a discount store, so I didn't waste too much money. Of course, it sounded like a wonderful product and I didn't expect it to work wonders but I expected it to work. I inserted batteries and the device fan moved very slowly and then stopped. I tried new batteries with the same result. My German Shepherd liked the sensation of the brush part and it did remove hair but the fan pulling in the fur had now power plus the opening to the compartment was very small. Not much fur would go through even if the fan was stronger.

The idea was great and if the fan were stronger to pull in more fur, this would be a fun production, but the key is the product has to work. In my experience, it did not work at all...no better than just using a regular brush. It ended up in the trash a few minutes later and was a total waste of time and money.",0
Gone in 60 seconds......,0
"In the Photo the catnip has some bits ,pieces & seeds. That's NOT what I received. This Large bag is ground so fine it's like powder! My 3 cats LOVE catnip But not this ! It's should come as the Photo shows!",0

"I bought 2 of these for my tank. They worked great the first month, then after that they wouldn't heat my tank. I read that the tank has to have great flow for them to work, but I have to wave makers and they still heat the tank. I finally gave up on them and got me 2 ehiem heaters and never look back.",0
"I actually got my money back on this - tried to review it before, but Amazon didn't allow the posting.  It's not organic/natural as it claims . . . I have one cat that cannot eat regular food so she has to eat organic now due to allergies.  And all three of my cats threw this up over the course of a few days so I stopped feeding it to them once I determined it was the food.",0
Cute little guy but his squeaker does not work and it is way smaller than u thought.,0
Great illumination,1
i take my dogs on night runs all the time and these collars work great. random people stop me to tell me how cool the collars are too.,1
I purchased this ball for my hamster. He loves to run around in it and we haven't had any problems with the ball opening while he is running around since we purchased it. I think this is a great way for pets to get exercise and I would highly recommend it!,1
For 12 paks and the amount of money it is on amazon it is a great deal 1 of this on PetSmart cost 10 $ well do the math ;) :),1
"We have a 70 lb. Lab who goes boating with us.  This has worked perfectly for helping us to get her on and off the boat at docks, etc.  Also will be handy if she decides to take a swim and we need to get her back into the dinghy or onto the swim platform.",1
"These trimmers seemed ok the first time I used them to trim my dogs nails.  Then I used them in a pinch to trim one of my cats nails and I noticed it didn't cleanly clip the nail, it left a little bit that didn't get cut through.  The next time I tried to use them on my dog, he yelped, the poor thing!  I think they are just too dull to cut the nail quickly.  These trimmers ended up in the garbage.",0
Cheaply made and flimsy. Was buckling asked put it together. Dog moved crate easily and broke out and ruined crate. Worst crate I have ever bought in 12 years in rescue and our rescue buys 25 crates a year. No for big dogs. Would have gave no stars but wouldn't let me.,0
"I had this for a little over a week. It worked great, material was sturdy, then it just starts leaking. I notice some of you guys put several gallons, I didn't even have half a gallon of water in there. Unfortunate.",0
"I purchased the small and the bigger size. The small one is great...even for my 64 pound german shepherd. The problem with the bigger one is that the hole is bigger as well. I like to put little kibbles in that toy (because I don't want to ""overfeed"" the dogs with treats). That doesn't work. I'll keep the smaller version.",0
"The durability of this toy is a joke. Chunks were coming off within minutes of play. And as in play, I don't mean just letting the dog chew on it. It was happening as my Labany and I were playing tug-a-war. I was hoping that the product would be a thick rubber like Kong or more of a tire material like the Mammoth tires, but it's a really soft, flexible rubber that breaks off under little stress. It's not worth the $13. At all. Very disappointed.",0
"First and foremost make sure you secure the lid properly so it does not come off. you have to put it on and then twist to lock it in place.  Our dwarf hamsters love it!!! And it is easy to clean too, well ventilated, etc...
If ordering for a dwarf hammie, make sure you get the right size...",1
"My rabbits didn't use this for a few months, but now one of them does.",1
I'm not happy it all .... It taked Two hold months before I got my ordet. Then when I did get my order one of the collar DOESN'T work at all. We buy New batters an still the dog collar DOESN'T work.,0
"Our dog doesn't play with any of them.  :(
They will eventually be donated.",0
Very bad choice. I did regret buying it.,0
good,1
"Came fast, new and works as expected.",1
Very cute and beautiful colors!  All the girls in my family will love it!,1
A little too hard...Chi lost a tooth chewing ....but I feed the dog food from this company and love it!!,0
Lost a star for the way the sponge containers click together which doesn't feel very secure and one of mine won't even lock on it just falls off. Otherwise its a good filter. Much bigger than expected however. I have a 40g Breeder and with 3 of the sponges in and 1 inch of substrate the filter is too tall and the sponges touch the substrate. Nice and quiet and you can direct the flow if necessary.,1
I do not recommend this,0
shrunk after washing a little but so far ok,1
My 6 month old Daschund had the stuffing chewed out in an hour.,0
I purchased this and right when I first went to use it it would not fit the thin threads on my sink i called and they said that because theirs was made of plastic and my sink had fine threads it would not work I did find a metal adapted that worked on line so I kept it I do water changes every other week I had this for about 9 months and now the body of the plastic that hooks on the sink cracked a hair line crack - I tried to contact Aqueon but their email says wrong format so I'll have to try and remember to call - I would not buy it again I would try and get a brand that was made better,0
"Super cute, but after a couple months the lights don't work/short out so only one light on the collar actually stays on.",0
"These hold up great.  I bought the X-Large based on other's reviews that they run small but I didn't find that to be the case.  I'm 5""10, 190lbs and they fit lose.  Still does the job but there are times that i would prefer a tighter fit for working with small objects.",1
My dogs love these. They give about twenty-thirty minutes of chewing time.,1
Arrived as expected. Thank you,1
"My lab made quick work of this ""jawz"" lol apparently  what they meant was any animal that has teeth and jaw's can destroy this product.
Seriously  The first game of frisbee we played and she chewed Part of the side off",0
I bought this for my daughter and it loves it. It is easy to install and also stays in place. It is a lot better than the one from a few years ago that we had.. would highly recommend this,1
Since I got this my dog doesn't even sleep in our bed anymore,1
Super great product!,1
Great product.,1
I have a beagle/rat terrier with short hair. She sheds just as much as long hair dogs and it sticks to everything! I have tried many different brushes and the Furminator works ok but it also pulls out good hair. I was told to try a rubber curry brush so bought this one because of all the good reviews. It works wonders!!! It gets so much hair off and my dog loves the massage. Would definitely recommend!,1
I bought this as a replacement for the last harness that I really liked. Looks like my younger filled out a bit so I bought the inch thick for him and saved this one for my smaller dog. I would recommend this item but for larger dogs go up a size. Only reason for the loss of a star is the last one snapped when my dog was on a lead.,1
"My parents raved about the soresto collar, so we gave it a try with our cat, Ray. (He's a Norwegian Forest Cat). The first two months were great, no fleas and he didn't seem to mind it at all. Sadly, right after Christmas we noticed he was recoiling from our touch. Upon inspection we saw he had two patches of a red rash right where the collar had been. We immediately cut the collar off and the rash is going away. Just a forewarning to keep a close eye on your fur baby if you decide to use it.",0
It was cool while it lasted.  Threw some dog biscuits in it for the first time and within 15 minutes my pit had ripped this thing apart.,0
"My cat played with it for about 5 minutes, then never touched it again. Plus the overall look and quality of the product is iffy at best. I want expecting the best product in the world, but at least make the product LOOK clean",0
Great sweater! Excellent quality.,1
It works Immediately When she barks Can she understands when and not to bark And that's been in 2 days So i can say thank you for this item And I will let my friends know if they have problem with the dogs barking to get this item Can also save money,1
They do not produce alot of light or heat. They are very small in size. I do like the fact that they are solid. Unlike other heat lamps for reptiles they are very loose in their socket you screw in & break with the slightest movement.,0
"Love this dog food. I've struggled for years with my Rhodesian Ridgebacks having skin allergies and issues. Since switching to Blue Buffalo, they have been skin issue free for the past 3 years. Yes it is more expensive than traditional dog food, but the quality of the food is so much better. Not only do they not have skin issues but their coats look so much better too. I highly recommend Blue Buffalo Freedom Grain Free. I would say I wish it were cheaper but Amazon has the absolute best prices and having 4 dogs is my own fault.",1
"Shea loves it. I highly recommend this product.

Shea claws on it, sleeps on top of it, and is getting all the kitty rest she needs inside it :3",1
The dog collar is nice quality but the metal seat belt buckle is much too heavy for a dogs neck. I think if the designer made a buckle half the size it might work.,0
"This power head worked really well, unfortunately it lasted only six weeks and the warranty is for 4 weeks.  I have pumps in my tank that for six years and still going strong.",0
Not nearly as bright as I was hoping. I was hoping to be able to throw it in our dark yard and see where it was... definitely no. The first time I threw it for my dog he went and got it and then just chewed on it...,0
It's ok was expecting more,0
"I bought this food at my local pet store because it was cheaper. My 4 year old pit-bull has ate iams from the age of two. now that my income is a little better I decided to try a high quality grain free dog food. when i first introduced this food to him, he smelled it and ran away. he is constantly licking and scratching until he bleeds. and also is always shaking his head. the first day he had bloody stool but that went away. the only thing that changed was the food. I still want to give my dog high quality food, but unfortunately this one was not for him :(",0
"The small is too big for my maltese and so stiff I don't know how a dog could walk in it.  I tried to return, however, was unsuccessful.  I gave it away and lost $36.00.",0

"I usually use washable reusable puppy pads and decided to give these pads a try, as I've trained my Yorkie to go potty inside (and out) for traveling and condo living purposes.

"Dog had 5 minutes...too tempting and ripped apart. It would be fun, probably for a light chewer.",0
Not sharp and too thick to cut nails cleanly. Not good like the old Resco blades. Nails crack and break,0
Obviously not airtight when you use it.  I noticed my pup's treats went stale after a few days.  Big no no for dog food - especially big bag food that lasts for a long time.,0

"Very study rigid construction lease. The lease is made from all nylon so it has a stiff feel to it but feels much more solid than the double layer leashes I've bought in the past like the highly rated PetsLover lease which after some abuse frays and comes all unraveled. I like that the stitching is offset from the edge quite a bit, so if some fraying happens from dragging, etc, the lease won't fall apart. Soft padded handle, D ring for attachments, and highly reflective stiching. I would say its the sturdiest feeling lease I've bought and I've gone through a few.",1
Made calibrating my co2 super easy. Quick shipping.,1
Poorly made. took a chance and now regret it. Woke up to the collar being flat. Just know that larger dogs are too strong to have to have a inflatable cushion impede them from licking anything. Avoid at all cost,0
Ordered this for my friends car and she went crazy about it. She loves her new toy.,1
"Cute bags but they are kind of see-through. As long as you don't mind seeing the poop in the bags, they work as expected.",1
Sizing chart is WRONG. I ordered a LARGE for my very lean 49 lb dog. It looks like something I'd put on my cat. Maybe. Maybe a chihuahua. It's very upsetting.,0
"Very chincy, My dog freaked it out so now all it does is flat line bbbbbebebppppppp.. ug. I asking to return for a refund",0
DO NOT BUY FOR GIANT BREED!! Bought this for our 150lb English Mastiff. She ripped the harness right off the leash in less than 3 weeks!! Thank God she only ran towards the neighbor and not into the street! How did they expect a stitch to hold a xxl dog?????? Waste of money!! And I couldve lost my dog!  the 1st picture is what the leash hooks to. Notice how its GONE in the other pictures??!!,0
Love these turned out to be a little big for dogs but I kinda put that on me not them. They work great I walked 3 dogs all over 70 lb and with these collars I'm able to do it by myself with no one dragging me around.,1

"I was so excited to buy this moustache and bring it home and thought about how cute my little boys would be carrying it around with silly moustaches on.  They usually LOVE all things rubber to chew on, so I thought this would be hysterical.  To my surprise, NONE of my three Pekingese would even touch it.  It had a very strong rubber smell, more so than normal, and even when I touched it with my hands and smelled, my hands smelled very strongly of rubber, so perhaps that was one of the reasons that they didn't want to put it in their mouths. Either way, very disappointing and would not recommend this toy. Also, the moustache and ball itself is WAY too big and heavy for anything besides a large breed dog to carry around.",0
Dog ate the first couple than refused them. Leads me to believe there is something in them not good for dogs because my dog will eat anything.,0

Love this tag! Came just as advertised and was nice and sturdy.,1
"I was looking for and used few shampoos for my cats thinking of myself as recently allergy ""dependent"". This shampoo is the best of the few I was trying on my cats. I started using it two months ago, I can see a lot of undercoat going off cats when using this shampoo. I like the smell of this shampoo, there is no harsh chemical scent (if you have allergy sensitivity you'll know what I'm talking about). This scent also evaporate quickly enough so my cats do not complain about it. Which mean: when I was using regular strong scented shampoo cats were looking for any occasion to roll over any dirt or rug to loose it, sometimes crashing my flower pot in room just to get rid of the smell. Cats also don't fight it like with regular anti-flea shampoo, they bath happier ;) thus I also start ""washing"" my cats often - once a week. After bath cats don't gag when clean (lick) them self. I like it and will buy it again. Just one point to the manufacturer, please do not change any of ingredients in it as other companies doing to be cheaper, it's not working that way. Thank you.",1
Smaller profile great for small dog.,1

Coralife is much better salt this is dirty salt and mixes poorly. I am switching back not worth the extra mixing time and frustration of surface skimming my water holding barrel. Cheap but i can get cheaper better salt localy so much for a once good brand.,0
"meh. girls didn't care for it. I had to put all the chuck-it skimmer toys in the trunk of the car before they would even think about going out on the lake to get it. Otherwise they just pretend they didn't see it, meanwhile, I'm watching my 11 dollars or whatever float away. Like I said, eventually they went and got it when they realized I wasn't kidding. But I would never throw it on the water again. I have an older dog so i might try rolling it in the grass for her, but really we are all underwhelmed.",0
Great,1

"We have used these Synovial -Flex Chews for years, our last order prior to this one was May of 2016. From that time until this current order, the product changed manufacturers and though the ingredients listed appear similar, the product itself was changed from moist chews to dry crumbling chews smell smell very different and by our dogs' reactions, taste different as well. So after many years of use, it is time to find a replacement.",0

Its cardboard people, is it worth sticking to your repeat customers ?
Really is the Greed worth it ?",0
All the reviews about this stuff getting everywhere are completely true. I thought they were just exaggerating or that maybe it just tracked near the box. No. This stuff would be on the entire other end of my apartment nowhere near the box. It literally got everywhere. It was not any better at clumping than any other brand. I still had to scrape the mess off the side of the box. Only reason I could see anyone buying this is if they literally cannot carry anything heavier.,0
"Do not waste your money on this product!  It broke after less than a week, with my kitten laying on it.  The hook broke in half.  It also took weeks for it to arrive.  No matter how low the price is - don't buy it.  Piece of junk.",0
"This spa looked so good.  My cat loves rubbing his face and gums on my fingers.  I figured this would be awesome for him!  The spa comes in pieces you must assemble.  You have to attach pads on the bottom (one pad was missing from my box, but it didn't make any difference.  Then you have to fill little pockets in the blue pads with catnip (careful it falls right out and makes a mess) and attach the pads to the base, which was very easy.  Then put in the blue dome and the gum massager in the middle and sprinkle a bit of catnip in the well right under the gum massager.  The result:  My cat cleaned up all the loose catnap with his tongue for me, then he somehow managed to lick the catnip out from the well under the gum massager, and since then he has completely ignored this spa for the past 2 weeks.  Sigh.  It was completely wasted on him.  I am getting some fresher catnip soon and I will try again, but I don't think he's going to take to this ""activity center.""",0
"My cats love this tree!  Just make sure you have enough room for it...it's really large!  It is very well made, and it's very sturdy.  My cats are not gentle, by any means, and the run and jump on there, and they wrestle on the top perches with no problem.  I've had this a long time now, and I have not had to tighten any screws yet.  Easy to assemble too!",1
"This is an update from a previous review, changing from a 4 star to a 1 star.  Item arrived as described, shipping was quick, here it comes...but after 24 hrs in tank a slimy film appeared all over the anemone, I washed and removed all the slime also had to clean tank due to particles coming off the anemone. After about 2 or 3 days the slime reappeared, removed and washed again.  This is ongoing I like the anemone in the tank but what chemicals is it putting in my tank is the big question so I will be removing this from the tank. I wouldn't recommend this item.",0
Got this for my cat! She hated it- but I loved it:),1

MY 8 lb maltese's favorite food.,1
"We have had to store the treats in a treat bucket that has screw top lid (plastic food storage container).
Our cat is seriously hooked on these treats (all flavors).
He was thin Bengal and the treats has added a few pounds on him (now he is average weight now). He hounds us every time we go near the treat bucket. So we have had to limit it to a few treats in morning/night to avoid the pudgy look.

Wonder what they add to them that makes them crave the treats?",1

Okie dokie,1
Loud loud loud. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but it seems to have an extremely slow flow rate and the loud gurgling bubbling  sound with my air pump attached sounds horrific. Try to sleep with the noise as if some is sitting next to your bed blowing bubbles in milk next to your head ANNOYING!!!!!!,0
Works great for smaller mats that my cat gets. It also worked good for the thick under coat on our lab mix.,1
"Very misleading - These are the tiny cans, just so everyone knows. I thought they were the large cans as well because of the high price.",0

"The balls were larger than anticipated, very hard, and my lab ate through the first on in minutes...normal tennis balls take him days if not weeks to chew threw.",0
"I was hoping for better from this since it seemed like such a great concept. First, only buy if you have one cat. Doesn't really work for multiple cat households unless you have a couple litter boxes. 2nd...make sure the lid is latched BEFORE you do anything. That should be common sense but...double check. And, not thrilled on the clean up process. The inside MUST be hosed out regularly because the litter sticks to everything on the inside, especially the grill area, and I rolled and ""cleaned"" several times a day. I'm glad I got this on an Amazon Alexa deal because I would have been even more disappointed had I paid full price. As it stands now, I have a $25 waste of money piece of plastic taking up room in the garage :-(",0
this smells so wonderful! I rinse it out after applying it because it seemed to weigh down the hair a little too much but it sure made combing out easier even days after a bath.,1
My dog loves this!,1
3 month old kitten loved it.  But it only took her 20 minutes to pull the mouse off of the toy and the fun was over.,0
Calmed my cat down very quickly.  Wasn't expecting it to work so fast.,1

My dogs love it! I love that it does not have fillers.,1
"This is exactly what I was looking for. A sturdy brush that can get rid of all that extra fur without being uncomfortable to my cat. As you can see, it worked, although because the teeth in the comb are so fine, it took me many many strokes. Overall Im so happy with the results. My cat did not have any matting.",1

This product broke as soon as I took it out af the package.  Didnt even get to use it one time.,0

Two out of three of my cats ate it.  I was not expecting the calming treat to be so big.  My diabetic cat acted strangely after it - like she did not feel well.  I will not be offering it to her again since I think it had sugar in it.  My youngest and largest cat loved it.  He ate both his and the picky cat's treat and had no strange side affects from it.,0
"I have a small 12 lb Boston terrier. She tends to play a little rough with her toys so I hesitated with buying this fox. I ended up getting it and big mistake !! She had the stomach ripped open within 10 minutes of me giving it to her. So I had to pull the remainder stuffing out... and now she just plays with the empty ""stuffing-free"" carcass of the fox. If you have a dog that enjoys chewing on their toys , avoid this one.",0

"I had the highest hopes that his stuff would work to help my poor dog. Unfortunately it just made things much worse. After using it, a few hours later we noticed his face was swollen and his eyes bloodshot. He became very lethargic and would not eat. We ended up having to take him to the emergency vet after he started to vomit and they told us he had been poisoned by this stuff. We brought the bottle in and they told us this is what caused him to get so ill. Our poor dog almost died. In the beginning I was happy to be paying $20 for a solution to my dogs issue...it's really true you get what you pay for. Now I'm out $2,400 thanks to the trip to the emergency vet and our dog has even more issues than he started with before we used this crap. DO NOT PURCHASE AND USE ON YOUR PET.",0
Grass came half dead and when I contacted customer support was basically told the dog wouldnt notice. However my dog who has used lawns from other brands with no problem will only put two feet in and pee off the side of it,0
No good does not work used for 2 days then no spray did stop barking when it worked  purchased another same prob do nor buy,0
This stuff is like catnip for ferrets!!! They absolutely love this paste and will pretty much learn any trick you want to teach them with it. It also does help when trimming their nails because they are more into the paste than you trimming their nails. I definitely recommend this product the ferrets are not only getting a treat but vitamins included.,1
"These are my dogs favorite! I buy the small because I watch his diet, and he's very happy with that. He is 20 lbs.",1

"It was great to find the periodontal softgels on line- they are twice if not more the cost at my vet and since I do not like the front office staff, ordering on line allows me to have less contact with them.

No issues with these those, they are just as they should be.",1
Instead of small dog it should say tiny cat. It is literally the size of a small mouse. I have a 4lb Yorkie and it is way too small for him.,0
"Sizing was way off. My two 55lb dogs typically wear a 2XL. I followed the size chart, and ordered an XL. It was WAY too big.

Quality seemed okay, sleek outside, soft, thick inner. I'm disappointed, and one of my dogs was sad that I didn't let him wear it (the other is 100% okay with not wearing anything, ever).

I returned the product.",0

"I've bought several of these leashes. They are ridiculously strong (I have two German Shepherd Dogs) who have pulled and yanked with all their strengths.

My dog loves them,1
"I actually bought mine from a local pet store but after seeing these reviews, I was a little scared to use them. I went ahead and put the collars on both my cats. One cat did okay with it as he was not trying to bite it or take it off, but he kept itching that area so not sure if it was irritating his skin or if he just wanted it off. But my other cat had been constantly licking under her neck and itching, I think it irritated her. Anyway, I've been monitoring her and yesterday I thought she was playing with a toy but noticed she was keeping her head down for longer than normal. I went over to her and she had the collar stuck in her mouth, head down and couldn't get it out. She must have been able to get a hold of the collar with her tongue or teeth and moved it up into her mouth to bite it, where it lodged and got stuck. Freaked her out and freaked me out. When I tried to pull it off her, she struggled with me because she didn't know what was happening, and I'm sure my stress/fear was rubbing off. I remember the instructions said to keep it semi-loose so that it could be snugly fit over the head, so thankfully I did that and was able to pull the collar off from the back side. So I tried to tighten it a little more as I realized I had more room to fit it snugly, so tried it again today. I'm glad I was monitoring her because it happened...AGAIN! BOTH TIMES it did not break away. This 2nd time she was near my other cat, so when she freaked out, it freaked out my other cat and he went chasing after her like she was prey - both had flared tails and were hissing/growling. I couldn't get to her to take it off since she was trying to stay away from my other freaked out cat, so it just compounded her fear and stress. I had to get my husband to grab her and hold her down - she was like a cat on crack, swiping at me and rabbit kicking with her hind legs (and claws!!!), I felt so sorry for her that we had to hold her down. And since I had tightened the collar this 2nd time, I couldn't pull it over her head ....so I didn't want to choke her and had to run and get scissors to cut it off. A few scratches later, she and I are doing better but this was so scary. I realize it may help to calm cats, but if for any reason you think your cat may not like a collar, please please please don't buy this item for your cat, especially if you cannot be around to monitor - it takes only a second for it to happen - it happened right in front of me that 2nd time. I was lucky to be home to monitor her, but had I or my husband not been home, I think she would have done more damage to herself trying to get it off. I'm sad for her that I tried it twice and both times it got stuck in her mouth. I would not recommend this collar unless they completely fix this safety issue. Surprised it still has not been fixed despite all the bad reviews and complaints to the company directly. I will be sending them my formal complaint as well, I'm just lucky my baby didn't get hurt; however, the whole point of buying these collars was to try and calm my stressed out cats (due to a vet visit) - and NOW we have even more stress and anxiety issues to deal with since these incidents. I am trying out the spray and diffusers now, hopefully we can get some peace.",0
Convenient sized tank except the lights stopped working after a month.,0
"My indoor cats are used to eating 3 x/day. These feeders (I got one for each cat) allowed my once/day cat nanny to provide multiple feedings. The feeders each require a AA battery for the timers. Also, I put each feeder in a low box with some nonskid carpet material under each box to keep the cats from trying to wrestle the feeders around to get the food prematurely. That worked better for me than smaller, lighter-weight feeders I tried previously.",1
"Absolutely NO effect WHATSOEVER.  I was very hopeful this would work as I don't like to use toxic and cancer-causing or cancer-linked chemicals.  My old dog died of cancer of the spleen...how do you get THAT? I suspect all the flea and tick stuff...but anyway.  This is supposed to work by the magnetic strip causing a tiny electric field, just enough to be annoying to fleas, but not in any way near the level where it may cause harm, even with long term exposure.  I tried this for my new rescue pup, and I really did try my best with this stuff, followed the directions, even made sure to double-check them.  It worked about as effectively as opening the window to let the fleas jump out of it.  Save your money.  A complete waste of mine.  He never stopped nibbling, even once.",0
This dog house may look good but it is made of very cheap wood.  I had it for 2 days and after it rained the top and sides of it started to warp.  I had to go buy some Thompson's water seal and seal the whole thing.  My husband ended up laying some left over shingles over the top of it so the water would actually drain off it properly when it rains.  After 3 months it ended up being firewood and my husband decided to just build one.  It was less expensive than what we spent on this piece of junk.,0

"While the price was great, the product itself is not so great.  It's the flimsiest dog crate I have ever seen.  It's not very strong and if you have a large powerful dog they are going to get out of it easily.  I have one from over 7 yrs ago that still strong and sturdy but a little to small for my 10 mth old lab puppy, but I am going back to it because I know it will hold her the way it was designed to do.  I won't even consider putting my 2 yr old boxer in it.  He'd have it torn down in no time it's that flimsy.  If you want it to hold a small dog or a pregnant dog with her puppies it might be ideal but it's not a great tool to use for crate training or leaving alone for medium to long periods of time while crate training as the dog would be able to bring it down and get out easily.",0
My 15 year old American Bobtail Ragdoll loves it.,1

My dogs would not eat these.,0
Way too soft to be any real useful toy for dogs that play fetch. Easily chewed and I wasted my money unless you can return a chewed toy,0
ended up returning it - my ex-brother-in-law had a few of these intended for horses we use to use with our american bull dogs - they stood up well - they really bounced well and our dogs really liked them - i bought this as it is from the same company and made for dogs - what a disappointment - first the handle is awkward and promotes chewing (and comes apart in chunks within mins of chewing) 2nd the ball doesn't bounce well at all - my puppy APBT was bored in 5mins with it - and he loves playing soccer with regular balls...,0
I bought this for my daughter who has used it for less than a week.  She has a Corgi mix - still a puppy but quite strong.  It seems to be holding up so far - I'll update if anything changes.,1
Within an hour my dog has eaten the squeak out of all the squirrels.  Really!  Now she goes to look for them and we had to fit items small enough to hide that will squeak.  Waste of Money,0

"Cool concept and constructed to last. However, the horn cap was way too small and the saddle was way too large. All seemed to be misproportioned and didn't fit my dog at all. Sadly, this STAR WARS fan had to send it back.",0
There are just too many variables for something like this to work. the dog shaking its head sets it off. Another dog barking close by Set It Off. You've got two collars. two dogs together. if one sets off the warning sound the other dog hears it too.confusing.plus any collar that requires metal prongs making skin contact with a dog's neck has to be pretty tight. I'd imagine that's uncomfortable for your puppy.,0
"I have (2) maine coon cats that get pretty bad mats on their undersides (chest, underarms, and haunches).  Typically I can get them out with some vigorous combing and brushing but some are just too tight.  I bought this because it had good reviews, and I am sick of paying $75 for the vet to clipper off the bad matts every few months.  But, this clipper won't cut through the matts.  I think the motor is strong enough but the blades just aren't setup right to get into the tight matting.  It just hits the matts and stops, won't go through them even with lots of wiggling and pushing.

2 stars for all the accessories included with the clipper and the carrying case, which was a nice bonus.  Just too bad it won't work on my cats.",0
Lasted exactly 1 month. Not cool.,0
"I write this review every morning while I'm trying to scoop the cat's boxes. This is the most terrible litter ever created. It makes scooping the box SO MUCH MORE difficult than it needs to be. The litter doesn't clump. It becomes a sticky mass glued to the bottom and sides of the box that I have to jab and scrape at and try to chisel out. It makes an awful task even more horrible, and I'm so sorry I bought two bags of it. Mixing it with Tidy Cats does help some, but once this stuff is gone, I will never purchase it again.",0
Not long lasting. My dog went through these very quickly.,0
"My Persian refused to use this litter. She went 2 days without voiding and moving bowels. I checked all over the apartment to be sure...NOTHING!  When replaced with her Tidy Cat, she immediately emptied out! Please remove the ""Buy Again"" from my board.",0
"This device makes my 3 adult cats act like they're possessed by cat satan. They go absolutely bonkers over this toy and it is the ONLY thing that gets all 3 of them playing together. Set it on the ""random"" mode and watch the hilarity ensue.

"I carefully read the information on this, and decided this is what I wanted.  It states ""Simply add weekly to maintain ideal water conditionsits as easy as that!""  I understood this was the product to use when changing the water.  IT IS NOT for getting rid of chlorine.

"It advertises xx-large but this is for small dogs. I have a Great Dane and thought I was purchasing boots and a rain coat for him. The coat was great, but the boots were these tiny things that wouldn't fit my big toe much less his paw. If you are looking for boots for a large dog forget these.",0
"It works as expected.  It doesn't scratch the Acrylic, and it cleans off the Algae.  Not much else need to be said",1

Works great!,1
Wetness does not go through the pad.  Very happy with this product.,1
"These leashes are great! They are thick & feel incredibly sturdy. I have two Labrador Retrievers (each 80 pounds), and it works perfectly for them - both the thickness of the leash & the sturdiness of the metal latch is excellent for large-breed dogs. I would definitely recommend this product.",1
Good!!,1
"Ive bought these several times and they were good the first couple of times but this bad smells like they are rotten. So bad we cant give them to the dog, throwing away.",0
"Great air pump. When it came it was very noisy and rattley, was concerned. Then I realized it was just a loose screw on the base. Tightened it up, now it's silent. I have 3 of these running on tanks, they're quiet and reliable.",1
"I already knew my puppy like them, it is just a matter of watching the pricing.",1
Great product and fast to put up! Thanks,1
Biggest piece of junk you can buy. Just after 90 days of purchase the remote stopped charging and working. After taking it into several different battery stores they told me that the battery is hardwired into the remote. The battery has expanded in the corner has started to rupture at this point  making the entire unit useless.  Because it is after the 90 day warranty it is basically my problem. I would give negative stars for this product if there was an option. Don't waste your money.,0
"Friends leaving the US had a cat living in their garage for many years, but she remained too wild to make the move with them.  I offered to adopt her; she now chooses to remain in one room inside our house and avoids me at all times.  One month with the collar has not helped and I'm now trying the spray.",0
I would not recommend ordering from here. The food was filed with worms and bugs. Must be old. Gross & disgusting.,0
I had this heat rock for three months after words the rock started to form very large cracks and started to over heat.,0
"Not as quiet as some reviewers mentioned. Scale 1 to 10 (loudest), it is about 7 when it is set to maximum. When it is set to medium strength, the noise is about 4 to 5.  I have used many other air pumps in the past and this one is not that quiet as other said.",0
Didn't like the odor that came with using this. My cat and I are used to no scent so we'll stick with that. I do like the light weight though.,0
Runs small.,1
"This spray only eliminates cat-pee smell if you have a really poor sense of smell.  I bought it specifically for that purpose, after discovering the kitties I was fostering were not, in fact, potty-trained.  I had already tried Dr. Foster's spray from the pet store and found it ineffective.  And so is this one.  It has a perfume-y scent to temporarily mask stench, and once that wears off, kitty pee-smell makes a comeback.  No bueno.",0
in 1st 5 minutes a 20 lb dog was able to chew through unto the rubber interior was in pieces - removed from dog as it could be choking hazard or cause intestinal obstruction.,0
This is one toy that has last more than any other I have bought for my medium size dog.  She loves you buddy!  Also bought the pink pig after seeing how well it held up.  Thanks you KONG!,1

I'm using a smaller one and wanted to upgrade it. I returned the new one since the engine was too noisy (not the waterfall it creates).,0
My 5 yr old maltipoo got lice somehow. We are not sure how but can only assume 1 of 2 things. 1 we had bought a travel cage for her because she likes to sometimes go into a cage to eat a treat or take a nap. 2 she could of got it at the groomer if another dog had it. She does not go to dog parks or day care. Any way as you can imagine we were devastated & grossed out. I did a lot of research & found great reviews about this shampoo & also read another review on here about a dog with lice. As soon as I got the shampoo I washed her twice following the directions to lather it up & leave it on for a at least 5 minutes or 10 if really bad. Make sure to keep away from the dogs eyes. I must say this stuff is amazing I saw them falling off in the tub & also when I was blowing drying her. I will definitely do another shampoo again in a few days & than again in a week or so to make sure to kill any eggs left behind. Definitely buy this shampoo it saved us..,1
It works better than expected. I would recommend this to anyone with a fish tank. I just wish I purchased sooner.,1
"Good product. Just the right size, not too lightweight for big dogs.",1
A large is actually a small,0
"This used to be my favorite cat grass product. Simple package, throw it together, lush growth, easy as heck.
Last month they decided to cut the amount of growing medium in the cup. This sad picture is the result. I'm cancelling my subscribe & save and just buying seeds separately from now on.",0
waste,0
4t3t,1
useless does not work . Save you money,0
"it's huge BUT not comfortable, I opened it up and I see why. Very cheap! TOTAL RIP OFF! Will not recommend this bed or seller to anyone! A bunch of ripped up foam inside not even disbursed evenly... Really patchy. This POS is gong straight to the trash!",0
Very tiny and took forever to arrive! Won't be purchasing again!,0
"What a waste of $100. Parts were broke, it wasn't cut right and the parts were not even, rabbit pee falls right through to the ground, can't pull the tray out to clean it because it's not even. This cage  absolutely  Sucks!",0
Does not work at all. My dog continued to bark. I sent it back.,0
"Camped on the beach and my solid black husky got away from me but I was able to keep up with the direction he was headed because of this collar. Super bright, but I don't recommend attaching a leash to it.",1
Worked well for about 3 days and then the electric shock stopped working 2 days later both the sound and vibration stopped working.  waste of money still waiting for a refund.,0
"Thin material, seams popping and poor stitch job.",0
My dog is a chewer. He destroys everything! We've had this bone for over a month and he's still working on it! Great purchase.,1
"Like another review said, they leave behind the fish pieces. And there are actually bones as well. Every other kind of Tiki Cat, they attack like they've never been fed before. I love the brand. They could discontinue this flavor and it wouldn't be missed.",0
Good for my large cat. He hasn't figured out the flap door so I may have to remove that part but he was excited when I opened the package. I left his smaller litter box beside the new one until he can maybe figure the flap out.,1
"No effect on the neighbors barking dogs.  Pretty loud, I'm sure the neighbors could tell what I was attempting.",0
A great buy for the price!,1
If I could give zero stars I would. It came missing one of puzzle pieces that go inside the frame. It was sooooo hard to get together. Every time you thought you were almost done the whole thing would fall apart. This is not worth your anger and frustration trust me!!!,0
"We have two small dogs, but I have no room for the huge bags of dog food I should be purchasing. I hate running out to get a small bag of dog food every week, so the subscription service through Amazon is great.  I get 3 bags at a time sent right to my door and best of all, they end up about $1.50 cheaper a bag than at Wal-Mart (and no shipping charge).  You can't beat that, thanks Amazon!",1
I wasn't happy . When I got them probly 450 were dead,0
Rough textured wood- a gerbil would chew on it. NOT recommended.,0
"I have a small medical alert dog,  who only goes outside for potty.  I swear this K9 works like flea food.  We have had horrible flea infestation since using this product.  I worry about giving my dog poison, but we have to keep the fleas away.  This stuff poisons my dog,  but doesn't get rid of fleas.  My dog is a healthy 8 year old,  and he goes out into my private backyard.  Save your money,  buy something else.",0
I have ordered this item serveral times and the product always arrives in excellent condition and very promptly.  Excellent seller to purchase from.,1
"Our puppy lost interest after she could no longer get to the filling.  She will occasionally
go back to this but she is spoiled and gets something new almost everyday.  At least
it seems like it.",1
"Nice cuddly stuffed animal, but the little electronic heart didn't work. Returned for refund.",0
It's really cute but I ordered a large and it was a so small. Also the fabric is very thin and comes  undone .,0
My dog hates this doesn't even look at it,0
"We received the size large for our Akita German Shepherd. It did not fit at all, we made some adjustments and cut some things and added stuff. So he can he strapped in with it now, but the rope and buckle from dog to seatbelt is just much too short, or should be something that can go over the top of the seatbelt rather than the bottom. His legs get caught in it if he's not sitting the one way he can with the belt. It takes some work...but I guess it's safe",0
It was much smaller than I expected especially the post.  The diameter was much smaller than I wanted....,0
Zero star. Does not heat up.,0
"The price was fantastic.  The size was what I needed, the rubber nipple.... More like hard plastic, so in the end I had to buy another top, therefore adding an additional cost not really making it a great deal in the end.",0
way too small,0
Don't waste your money...did not help the flea problem one bit...I finally broke down and took my two bichons to the vet and got them on Brevecto....smartest thing I could have done.,0
Caused our dog bad digestive issues - we were able to single it out as the case. Also having trouble returning one of the un-used bags we bought.,0
Probably not the best if you have chewers,0
I bought this because I have an Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog and his are pretty big. This thing works great. It saves your back and its pretty easy to just spray down with a hose. I highly recommend this to those who have dogs in general. You and your back will appreciate it.,1
"cute, well made!",1
Have had these bags for the last 4 years. Recently changed and no plastic spindle in the middle. They snag on the dog bone bag holders and don't dispense. Don't waste your money! Amazon rep was amazing but these don't have return option since not through Amazon.,0
"It is for a big dog, I have a Pomeranian and the squeaker was hard and the length of he toy. We just threw it",0
The container was smashed and half the gravel was gone! Sad!,0
One of my piggies favorite things,1
"Good product, solid handles with smooth inserts. A middle handle sticks out a little - design problem, but overall just a great leash.",1
This is great stuff and the only thing I use when starting new tanks or when adding tap water.  It's the best detoxifier in my opinion.,1
"After rescuing a 2nd dog from the shelter, my sister sent these to me as a welcome present to my new dog Dixie.  Her and my senior dog, Sadie, absolutely love these.  They can also be broken into smaller sticks which is great for my smaller dog.  I like that they come from the USA and not China and that they don't contain too many extras as my Sadie is allergic to several things so it's not always easy to get treats for her.  Since my sister has sent these to Dixie, I have had to re-order them already.  They have become a favorite treat in our house!",1
dripped all over the place and made a big mess,0
"My husband bought the new, all tape, retractable Flexi leash last night, and this morning, first thing, our 9 month old Australian shepherd bit through it.  We purchased this leash to replace our old Flexi that had served us well through several dogs, but it was getting tired and no longer retracting well.  The heavy duty tape section on the old leash was not even frayed, through much chewing and biting, but the tape on these new leashes is thin and it only took one bite.  As long as your dog does not bite the leash it works well, though I missed having a fixed stop as I often kept our old leash locked in that position for walking near traffic.",0
very poorly made broke after one day of use don't waist your time or money,0
***NO STARS***  This isn't an actual shoe size but smaller than my hands... My bichon had this for 45 mins and put a hole  in it... not good for chewing...don't waste your money.,0
I've used this product twice since I've had it and every time I have used it a fish has died. I should have learned my lesson after the first use. I don't think it's  a coincidence that two fish bit the dust after each use. The first fish took a couple of days and the second died within twelve hours. This stuff is going in the garbage.,0
Sorry we bought it. We will return it. Cheaply made.,1
My two Labs love it but I have to supervise and take it away after play or else it would be eaten to shreds.  But it's worth it totally to see their happiness when I bring it out.,1
My cat doesn't care for this flavor.,0
Very cute!,1
They work gret,1
My dogs love this treat,1
Easy to put together and sturdy enough for my 2 dogs that are both under 15lbs. I very good purchase.,1
It is sturdy and exactly what I expected. Great value!,1
I have a 9lb dog and well I can only buy her food in 5 or 15lb bags! This fits 15lbs perfectly!,1
"We have been using this now for just under 20 days, and so far so good! I have been waiting for signs that it needs changed early after reading other reviews, but so far there are none! We only have one cat, she's small (about 6 pounds full grown), and goes to the bathroom usually only once per day, sometimes twice. At first, she ran over to watch everytime it started, which led to her tripping the sensor all over again, but she's adjusted and now doesn't even notice it. We also had no problems getting her used to the box - she tried to jump in and use it while we were setting it up! Overall, highly recommended! May look into getting one of those forever trays, but we'll see how it goes!",1
"This is a great bed for the money!!  I was grateful that there was a review by an owner of a 60# Weimariner as I figured that dog's size was pretty close to my dog.  My Standard Poodle, Mocha Java, is VERY tall and lanky and weighs 55 pounds.  I was afraid that the bed might be a bit small for her and I decided if it was, I'd let our Pekingese have it.  But no!  She absolutely loves it, curls up in it, puts her head on the bolster and she's a goner!  She has plenty of room.  Thank you for a great product!",1
LOVE this product!  Yellow urine stains disappear quickly and smells go away nearly as fast.  I really like the no-fragrance added with this product so no added perfumed odor is left behind.  No odors left at all!,1
"The BEST cat box ever. Super easy to use and big enough for my XLg cat to get into. I thought my daughter was crazy when she told me about it, but she was right on.",1
It's a nice cold weather coat.,1
"There is no product description; weight, bag or box, etc. . I accidentally bought this.thinking it was a 3lb. Bag especially with the $12.99 price it was a 16 oz box.",0
"Dog has been on this 2 years, we have seen great improvement in his flexibility and energy. Will continue to repurchase!",1
Don't do this to your dog.  Get yourself trained and then your dog.  Trust me... This is not how to train a dog.,0
Very small in width.,0
"I have used this for two seasons in the hot Arizona desert, so that my geese will always have water.  It works good.",1
This item was not as advertised. I did not receive a Duracell brand battery as shown. I did receive a 9v battery but it was a generic brand.,0
Nice durable and stylish water bowl for the dog. Easy to clean and picks up less stain than Steel.,1
Worthless.,0
Had no base when I received it and would not charge with just the adapter.,0
Fabulous!,1
"My 6 week old kitten almost died from Hartz Kitten Milk replacer.  Thank God I had only mixed baby Gerber food with it. Her health declined shortly after I gave her this milk, vomiting & diarrhea. She looked so bad from one day to the next. The mother cat had to be put down, and Hartz was all they had at the store that day.  I did not check the reviews prior of purchasing this product, wished I had ..

I checked online to see if vomiting and diarrhea was a common symptom with this product, only to find a dozen related death reports. Not just here on Amazon, you can read about it at hartzvictims dot org. This company should be put out of business for giving out products like this to our pets. It's not just the milk for kittens, their flea products kill pets too.

My kitten is on GNC now and slowly getting better.",0
My large 91 lbs goldendoodle hard a difficult time walking up this ramp. We tried several times with treats in tow. It would be more accessible it was longer and wider.,0
Works great!,1
They smelled terrible.,0
"I measured 3 times. When item came in, it was too big. It fell off immediately.",0
This is not what I was looking for when I received this item It had no instruction paper and no screws when I went to the hardware to  buy some screws I was very upset just thinking about all i had to go through.  I came home and attempted to put the gate together and became even more upset when screwing it into the wall.  I went through a lot in considering to keep this gate eventually I just gave up and return the item back to the merchant.,0
"This IRIS storage container rolls underneath the first tier of shelving in my utility room in the garage & I keep it filled with bird seed. It rolls out easily, the lid opens fully, & because it is airtight, I don't worry about the seed going ""off."" It is the third one I've purchased & the others are still holding up nicely.  Would recommend this product & vendor!!",1
"these are for our 3 dogs as Christmas gifts. realize it is early, but they will keep. they were discounted which made the purchase even better.
have had smaller ones that they loved so these should be greatly enjoyed",1
We've used this product from day 1 and have never found flees/ticks on our dog! It is also very easy to apply.,1
"I bought this crate at a local chain pet store, but regretted the price so I returned it and found this one on Amazon. It shipped quickly and was easy to set-up. It arrived just in time because my lab puppy had just learned how to escape from her playpen. The only recommendation that I have is to read the review that helps decipher what gage wire each Life Stage group has because the product descriptions don't specify this. This specific crate I purchased, is perfect for my growing ""constantly gnawing"" lab puppy. Highly recommend!!!",1
"We bought this for our 8 month old Shihtzu puppy, she chewed the top knobby part off right away! Waste of money. We bought the medium size and chewed it up. I will never buy anything like this again. I thought KONG products were better than this!",0
I had males marking in the house and thought this would kill  the spots but even after following instructions they came back to same spot and redid their marks. These places were on flooring and not carpeting so surprised it didn't work.,0
my dog loves it,1
couldn't really see any effect at all on our dog,0
I love these!  I have tried a few different types of clippers and my cat always acts like I'm hurting her.  This time she didn't even flinch with these scissors.  The vets who created these even reached out to me to ensure I got them on time and to see if I liked the design.  What an unusual thing that is these days.  I love small businesses.  Buy these....you won't be sorry.,1
Too small for my hamster to use.,0
Snake loves it. Hides in it all the time.,1
"Works great. Too bad my axolotls hate literally any light. With it on they are always camping in their hides. I turned it off so they could be happier, at the expense of me not having a nice planted aquarium. Oh well. Great light nonetheless.",1
"My dogs did not like the taste, so would not eat their food if I tried to mix it in and I could not get them to drink it straight from a spoon.  I'll go back to pills.",0
It's ok but not so great,0
"Mine arrived used, missing pieces, and no instruction manual. Very disappointed",0
"This thing is great! I'm only able to fit about 1/2 of my puppy's kibble in the 3"" ball (top and bottom half collectively) but this keeps her busy for a good 20-30min on the easiest setting. When I initially set it down on the floor she hit it with her paw a few times and got discouraged when nothing came out (the bottom is weighted, so her light taps didn't move it enough to make the food come out). To solve this I just got on the floor with her and showed her how to flip it and roll it and within 2 min she was flipping it with her paw, rolling it all over the apartment!

She's not big enough to grab the ball in her mouth yet (she's not a fan of chewing hard plastic anyway) so I can't attest to the durability of chewing and dropping the toy. But after banging around the tile, carpet, and walls of our apartment for about 3 collective hours the ball is still working perfectly and in great shape.

I'm not sure why some reviewers are having issues with the ball staying closed...as long as I make sure the tracks are clear of kibble bits my ball seems to lock in place on the final twist and will only open with a purposeful twist, thus preventing accidental opening when the ball is rolling.

As for the carpet vs hardwood/tile floor preference, the toy does get a little loud when it's being banged around on hard surfaces. I try to contain her to the carpet for the most part and I haven't had an issue with the kibble making the carpet dirty. But the food does come out easier on hard surfaces; most likely because there's no carpet fluff plugging the hole as it rolls around.

Overall I'm very happy and satisfied with this purchase. It's perfect for energetic dogs or developing puppies to get their brains working, their bodies tired, and their tummies full.",1
Tool works well. Cats love to be pampered with it. Grooming tool definitely cuts down on shedding and saves me from some of house clean up!,1
"Like another person on here, the acrylic completely broke apart when I was trying to twist the hooks in. Now it's zip ties and looking ghetto. My 2 cockatiels haven't touched it since I put it in their cage. I wouldn't buy again. They need to improve the hook mechanism.",0
"""This seller shipped Super fast!!! Got it in a couple of days at my door. What a GREAT price for it too!!! Thanks!""",1
"Great stuff....good for laundry too, for odor removal.",1
"Nowadays I have my dog on the Raw/Prey diet. However, I still keep wellness in stock and handy on days where I cannot prepare her meal. The reason is simple, Wellness is top of the line dry dog food.

Taking a quick glance at their ingredients and you will see the major difference between Wellness and your average, everyday, popular and cheap dog food.

However, don't just take my word for it. I encourage everyone do their own research and read about all the great benefits and possible cons associated with Wellness.",1
"I bought this for my senior lhasa apso who weights about 30 pounds and has a long body for his breed. He fit comfortably in it. I loved everything about this stroller but unfortunately, the front wheel attachment broke off after several months of use. The front wheel stem is soldered to a metal plate which is attached to frame of the stroller.  Metal fatigue caused the wheel stem to be broken away from the metal plate. A welder was able to weld it back onto the metal plate (cost me $45) but after about 2 months of using it everyday, it broke off again. Everything else about the product was great; smooth ride, light weight, easy assembly, easy folding and fits nicely into my car's trunk, nice material, padded handled bar which was nice on the hands, two cup holders, easy braking but it's no good without the front wheel so I do not recommend this stroller. After reading the other reviews about their other strollers/joggers, it seems like they have a problem with the front wheel design so I'm forced to buy from another brand.",0
"Woof, woof. Good!",1
Excelente producto.,1
Not very effective for my dog (German-husky breed),0
"My dogs love these soft treats but then again, what dogs don't love soft treats? They are moist and stay soft after a few weeks. I tear them into two pieces for training. I will buy them again for value and quality.",1
"I have two doodles and use this for trimming them ,,, the safety factor is very important.  Well worth the price for the quality.  You will never have to buy another shear.",1
"It's a bit on the pricey side, but it works really well.  I only wish the design was a little slender and pointed to make it easier to drive into hard soil.

Tip: Put a small amount of duct tape around the tip of the driving rod so it sits snug in the anchor and doesn't bounce out when hammering on it.  I had it bounce out once, and it damaged the steel cable.  This will also prevent dirt from falling into the anchor and compacting around the driving rod, making it easier to remove the rod when done.",1
"This leash functions well. It extends and retracts as it should. Comfortable to hold. However, I have a golden retriever puppy who is now over 50 pounds and she tugs a lot on the leash. She has broken two of these leashes in the past week! It always breaks right at the end where the leash is attached to the metal clip. I don't recommend getting this leash if you have a powerful dog who tugs a lot and applies a lot of pull on the leash. It will most likely break. If your dog walks like a good dog should, I imagine you will like this leash very much.",0
Cute canvases. Matched my daughter's garden themed room.,1
my cat is very sensitive to this brand as always seemed a little sluggish and sick after. be careful! we switched back to advantage/frontline.,0
"Pulled it out of the box. Assembly was simple. I put a pug puppy in there. It was good to keep him from peeing on the walls when I'm not around, but also it doesn't box him in like a regular crate. Sturdy.",1
I bought this for our Yorkshire Terrier.  Fit is great and so comfortable that she wears it out on walks.  Very well made.,1
"My Chihuahua is only 6 1/2 pounds, and generally fits any extra small item I buy for her. This shirt barely went over her head  unless your dog is 3 pounds or less I wouldn't recommend it .",0
"This is so cool, i`m so glad i bought this !!!
My dogs love this!!
Its bigger then picture shows.
Theirs lots a room so my dogs can turn there heads to really look around .
at who is walking up drive way and share looks at neighbors dogs nexted door...",1
"This crate is unbelievably cool, and I'll tell you why:
-It has this awesome sort of ""bay window"" in the back so your cat can see all around.
-You can easily check on your pet while they're in this thing too, as you don't have to peek through tiny little holes in the side like some of the more common carriers.
-Mine came pre-assembled, which was nice. It has plastic connectors to attach the top and bottom, and mine came with zip-ties on it for added security-although honestly I do not think they were necessary.
-It has a neat little lid on the top for holding treats, a leash, etc.
-The handle is nice and big. It feels like you definitely have a secure hold on the carrier.
-It's nice and roomy. My cat is 8 pounds and it seemed like she only took up 1/3 of this thing! Plus, if you have a little larger cat or dog, the way the door is designed is great. It's like the entire face of the carrier is the door, rather than how most carriers are designed with a little door that sticks out from the rest of the crate with a lip, making the pet feel like they have to travel through a tunnel to get inside.
-It came with stickers to put my cat's name on it!
-It has a food and water bowl that attaches to the door.
-My only complaint (and it's not really even a complaint) is that you do have to be sure when closing the crate that you have both the top and bottom metal pegs in place, because you can easily miss the bottom one if you're not paying attention. I don't think this is an issue at all, as I have never had a crate that wasn't like that, but just wanted to throw that out there.
-The door is very easy to open (for the human, not the pet!)... it's not an ordeal as it can be with some crates.
-I know this won't matter to lots of people, but this crate is actually pretty!
I really can't say anything negative about this crate. I highly recommend it not only for how amazing it is, but for the price it is even better! Seriously, everything else was twice as expensive and not even half as good.",1
"I was so happy to find the refill so that I did not have to spend twice as much. I use this for my Moluccan Cockatoo because he makes soup out of his regular water bowl. I was a bit worried at first, as the opening was a bit too wide for the previous rubber piece...I think they revised it since I purchased the other one many years ago. I had lots of parts, and one of the other rubber pieces fit just fine.",1
Received  rotted plant from a foreign country.,0
This is the best by far. And arrives fresh and quickly too.,1
Price is higher for some reason though.,1
"We initially got these crates for long road trips but we also now use them for crating our dogs at home overnight. For both uses, the crates have proven to be a good investment. Of course, you want your dog to be use to them or other crates before you confine your dog for extended periods of time, but that should go without saying.",1
Great product.  I buy every couple of months.,1
I haven't used all the scissors yet but did try out the thinning shears around my dogs face and was pleased how easy they were to make a nice clean trim.  The set came in a nice zippered case.,1
"My dogs love them, just pop the meds in the hole, pinch it shut and drop it on the floor.  Makes the job very easy",1
"I bought this product cause I thought it would work great for my toy poodle. But, it is to hard for her to pull. She is about 7lbs. So, if you have a small dog, then avoid this product. Would work great for a medium size dog. I think it would be to wimpy for a large dog. So, beware of what you are buying.",0
Love this harness. Great to keep control and stop dog from pulling if needed. Large fits 6 month old male pit perfectly with room to grow. Fast shipping. Very pleased.,1
"Im kinda new to the fish hobby and ordered some moss balls heard they help keep the tank cleaner. It came in on time and was happy with em, until i ordered from aquatic arts. The ones from here (luffy pets) looks a little fake. After a few weeks in my tank it is getting a little fluffier than before so i think its real. Attached is a picture comparison. The one on the (left) is luffy pets and the one on the (right) is aquatic arts. You be the judge on which one you like more, i know what my choice is.",0
Exactly as described. I will say this is very heavy when it is full but that is to be expected. It would be really nice if there was a to fill it from the top without having to take it apart. But it works wonderfully. It lasts about 3-4 days for 3 very large dogs.,1
"My 10 year old GSD has never had a problem with fleas but out of concern for ticks, and just to be safe, I elected to use something this year. I've had good luck with generics in the past so at half the price of known brands this looked like a good idea. When my dog started scratching obsessively and leaving blood stains on his bedding I was puzzled. He had just had his third dose of this stuff two weeks prior. Close inspection revealed the worst infestation I have seen since the days before these products existed. Bath water ran red with blood. After a dose of Frontline, a complete change of bedding and a dusting of Sevin on the carpets and the dog we are free of fleas. I cannot overstate the degree to which I am dissapointed in this product. The suffering of my dog and the expense and inconvenience to myself are inexcusable.
If it were feasible to take legal action I would do so. I do intend to report my experience to the appropriate agency .",0
Tried it for six months for our 13 yr old dog. No improvement at all.,0
"I wanted so badly for this to work... but it only encouraged my cat to lick her hot spots - every single time I applied it. Goes on, licked off, more bacteria in the wound, more damage to raw skin - completely counter-productive.",0
great,1
I received my package today however the ceramic bowl was broken into pieces.,0
Broke within a week.  Don't waste your money.,0
"it said large, for a dog, it was med, size of a cat.  there is no way a dog would fit inside..",0
Nice product but I ordered a medium for a medium sized dog and it would fit a large Chihuahua my dog is a small Border Collie I'll keep it and give it to a friend as far as quality goes it's very good,1
"It's not what I wanted ,wrong item.",0
My dog and her flea toy are inseparable.  I had to get another so we could wash one while she guards the other.,1
"I bought this bowl dec 16, 2016, used for the winter then put inside and used a regular water bowl.  Put it out december 1st, this year and it doesnt work!!!",0
Great. My puppy is dark brown and it's hard to see him at night. The bright orange and reflective tape help so much.,1
"I have been using this harness for about 2 months now and it works great. I have tried prong, choke collars, etc. Nothing works as well as this harness. My dog is almost 1 years old, she is a Great Pyrenees and weighs about 60 lbs. Yesterday was the first time in a long time that I walked her with a regular collar and she pulled and pulled, I was so frustrated. But with this harness it reduces her pulling by 80%. It doesn't eliminate the pulling completely but its a lot more bearable then a regular collar and a lot more humane.

I recently started running and this harness works great to keep her from pulling me while I'm trying to maintain a pace. I would recommend this harness to anyone that wants to stop their dog from pulling.",1
"BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING A HAMSTER, THIS IS BY FAR YOUR BEST CHOICE FOR A CAGE. WELL MADE AND ROOMY",1
I bought this for my chihuahua mix and she loves it. I was concerned about stability but the shoulder seat belt fit around nice and snug. I bought the medium because the smaller one was sold out in the grey color but she has room to stretch out which is her preferred sleeping position.  If your dog likes to stretch out the wider one will work.  Check dimensions of your seat against car seat. Mine fit flat even though my truck wasn't level due to way seat cushion is in segments.  The car seat sat flat on the seat edges and the belt holds it in place.  I bought separate tether to attach around headrest to her harness for security. The padding and cushion are a beautiful silvery grey and very soft.,1
Broke right after I bought this says it has warrenty but gives you no contact information on their website,0
"Been using this for about a year, have my puppy trained now so I barely have to use it. There are many levels that can be adjusted to where you are not hurting your pet, yet, it will make an impact i.e. distract your pet from whatever is distracting them from listening. Great communication tool for you and your pet. Also, after many of the complaints about batteries- I have not had to change them since I got it. QUICK TIP: TURN IT OFF WHEN IT IS NOT IN USE! that was save the battery.",1
"This is like a drug for my dog!  She loves this bone and it is pretty solid, it takes some time to break down.  Even with the strong gnawing from my big girl.",1
I've got a 10 year old poodle who is getting old and stiff.  He can't walk as far as he used to so now I push him,1
"Very small for the price. Sent back, and received a full refund.",0
This collar is a high quality product. The company was very responsive and pleasantwould definitely recommend!,1
Had this for 7 months. Took good care of it and the pump broke.,0
I love this it fits my dog great so a friend got one for her dogs that are much smaller and the fit was not as good so just check for size and you will probably be happy to. Great for when you are hiking in the woods or walking your dog at night makes him easier to see.,1
Our corgi mix will look SO HANDSOME in these! I also gave one to a coworker for her toddler to use! haha THANK YOU! I am so excited about these!,1
"Within 5 minutes of my puppy getting the treats out, he had chewed the eye off the frog. He is a 6 month old lab mix and is not a big chewer.",0
My Lucy begs for one of these every day.  She gets it at the same time each and every day and will not let me forget.  Lucy will be 16 in May and is having some trouble getting around and they do seem to give her some help.  They were delivered very quickly (so I did not run out before they got here).  That would have been ugly!  With the PetArmor Joint-Eze Plus for Dogs I really believe she has a few more good years.  Thank You,1
"I really wanted to like these, but both my small breed dogs did not feel well after eating these. I have no idea why but they didn't work for my dogs.",0
Ned bigger pieces,0
"This is the worst clumping litter I've ever purchased!  It doesn't clump well - usually just turns to a goo - and if it does clump, it crumbles so badly.  The product claims had my hopes up for this one and that made my disappointment even greater.

On the other hand, the non-lightweight version is pretty good although not as amazing as claimed.",0
These are good for cleaning my dogs teeth.  Never had a problem with the quality if I buy from amazon.;  I have had quality problems buying dog products from sellers other than Amazon.  Note to self. Never again.,1
"This ""WETNoZ"" cat dish was the perfect answer for my new rescue.  She kept pushing her food off of the edge of a flat saucer, and anything deeper seemed to cause her to leave the food at the very bottom.of a dish with any real depth.  We are both very happy with this dish.",1
The straps are pretty cheap. The large BARELY fits a Hyundai Sonata. I would definitely buy the bigger size and be ready to tie the straps once the clips break.,0
Much smaller than advertised per product description and measurements.,0
Helped make our walks more enjoyable. Our dog doesn't pull us along any more. Great quality. Great product. Great price.,1
"The toy came well packaged and on time. The only thing that is not great about it is the dispenser itself. It has a few different settings to outsmart your dog depending on how fast he/she can get the treats out.
I have a golden retriever and a cocker spaniel and neither of them were able to get the treats out before they labor interest. Even on the easiest setting, they wanted nothing to do with the toy after 5 minutes. I tried different treats, dog food and even small cut up ham squares (which both of my dogs love). Nothing really kept them interested. I think it was just too hard for them, or i must have really unintelligent dogs, which could very well be the case.
I plan on giving it away to a friend with labs, to see if it works for him.",0
Does not work,0
Split my cats' nails,0
"These tiny things are worthless. They don't absorb enough to be worthwhile. Even at the ""discount"" price, they cost far more than they are worth. We will try something else.",0
My 12-week old kittens LOVE this thing! They fight over it so now I'll have to get a couple more. Great size for them and good quality catnip.,1
"I ordered this one because it shows PSPC Inc.  I have another brand Dechra and it made my dog have violent loose stool.  As soon as I stopped giving it to her, she firmed back up and felt better.  The Dechra does not smell like the PSPC brand and it surely does not work with my dog like the PSPC brand did.  PSPC worked really well for her (12 year old lab with awful arthritis).  I was kind of pissed to have this product misrepresented to me when I bought it because she needs this stuff for quality of life and now I am stuck with nothing for her because a seller misrepresented their product.  I would never buy from this seller again due to the fact they are not honest.  The picture and the description says PSPC but trust me, you will get Dechra as some other reviewer had stated in another review.  Bad business!!!",0
"THESE BALLS SEEM LIKE THE ONLY ONES THAT MY CHIHUAHUA CAN ACTUALLY FIT IN HER MOUTH AND FETCH. THEY ARE STURDY AND SEEM TO HOLD UP--A GREAT MATERIAL, AND MY CHIHUAHUA STAYS ENTERTAINED FOR A LONG TIME.",1
For some reason this fell apart very easily--the screw going into the bottom broke off and there is really no way to repair it--the plastic grooves that it went into are seemingly destroyed.  So much for that!!,0
"My dogs liked these treats, but I thought they were gross. They had thick fat all over them and I didn't even want to touch them. I have gotten this treat from other places and they are usually not gross, as all the outside stuff has been removed. I would not recommend these to anybody.",0
Greenies pill pockets have made giving my Basset Hound his allergy medication a breeze. He LOVES them and gobbles down the pills with no hesitation. Thanks for the quick delivery.,1

"We have the Neater Feeder for our dog and decided it would be great for the cat.
By nature, our cat still wants to drag a wet piece of food out of the bowl, but the overall feeding area is much improved.",1
Just what I wanted,1
Warranty is useless. Doesn't cover the rubber gaskets that power the pump which tore after a month of use. Return handling if it had been under warranty is more than the cost of pump.  No airflow adjustment either (you can add a flow valve but don't bother.) Airflow is ample at first but pump can't withstand the added pressure of a control  valve and results in the pump gasket exploding. It died while I was away and ended up killing my fish :-(,0
"I really liked this container that I used for dog food, the size and shape of the box is perfect and thought the little door was very handy to reach for the food, that is until one of the two small plastic thingy that hold the small blue door together broke. Now I'm really disappointed as the box don't really close anymore. I suppose the small door is not made for open and close a couple time the day (hungry dog). Too bad as I even liked its color!",0
"I used this product for three months. Prior to starting this, my 7 year old dog had some plaque on her teeth and a little tartar starting to accumulate. She saw the vet in November, right before I started this and the vet said her teeth were ""a little dirty but nothing to worry about - keep brushing."" I did keep brushing, but added this to the mix. Yesterday at our vet appointment, my vet said her back teeth were completely covered in tartar and we will need to do a dental in the coming months. The only thing I changed was using this product.",0
"Oscar LOVES this toy! And it can handle the chewing too, over all very happy with it!",1
It certainly kept my lovebird busy for 3 days. Then it was gone.,1
"Didn't get until a couple days before July 4th but yes I believe it did, did not experience overheating as in other reviews.",1
"Item arrived promptly, appears well made. I vacillated between the medium and large for my 55lb Sringer Spaniel, I'm very glad that I ordered the large. He is a good swimmer but bought this for extra security when he comes out on the sailboat.
I wasn't sure whether he would like wearing it but he doesn't even seem to notice that he has it on. Works well, gives him extra confidence around the water as the photo shows!",1
They love eating this BUT 3 out of 5 cats got UTI so far by the time I started a  second bag. I paid expensive medical treatments each time and one of my cat died from the result. :(,0
"horrible!! tips over, food doesn't flow right - total junk.",0
Good Vacation Feeders for extended time away from home. Dousn't appear to cloud the water either. Couldn't find any trace of the food upon my return after 8-10 days away.,1
"I don't know what this stuff is, but it works.",1
Not sturdy at all.,0
The bulb blew out after two weeks of use. My brother had to buy a new bulb because I was out of state and he was watching the chameleon for me.,0
"while the quality of the materials in this product could certainly be better (the motor), it is still of above average quality.

more importantly, it has encouraged my cat to drink more, which is ultimately our goal here.

as a bonus, my cat has started to hold her paws under the flowing water when grooming herself. while the hair filter over the pool intake does a good job of catching hairs, the charcoal filter inside it filters the more fine grained materials. depending on the quality of the water you put in this device, it does a good job of recycling water.

if you are concerned by this, you should get used to cleaning this fountain regularly. i dismantle mine weekly and wash it thoroughly.",1
Just what I was looking for. I wanted a scooper to leave in my food bag but wanted something cute at the same time.,1
I've had the pet safe collars before and they work. This one doesn't work at all. Bummed. Doesn't even spray.,0
My fish are happy.,1
could be even louder...,1
"This thing took a while to receive, it ripped almost immediately, and my dog escaped it although my dog is really smart and can escape kennels and crates. I have a Australian Shepard mix named Goofy. I was excited when I finally got it and I followed the instructions and strapped my boy in. The first time using it, it ripped. Goofy was just trying to lay down in the back seat of my Camaro and in doing that the harness ripped. I set it up and followed the instructions but it still ripped and he can slip out of it easy. I tightened it to fit snug but he stroll finds ways to squirm out.",0
Great product for the price. This is my puppies favorite chew toy. It was much bigger than i anticipated which was great.,1
The fence is nice but the tarp is not at all like the photo shown.  The trap does not cover the complete top and does not provide any shade because it is so thin.  I'm very dissatisfied with the tarp.,0
These bulbs are inferior knock offs.  I purchased 3 of them last year and within a month 2 of the 3 had shattered at the end where the ceramic end piece is bonded to the glass bulb.  I'll pay the extra money this time for higher quality bulbs and you should too.,0
my Ziggy is used to this treat & I'm happy to be able to get it for him.,1
"Can hardly get the dog to stop for the night.
Built a fence post slingshot to send glow balls into the woods, dog hasn't lost one yet.",1
"Amazing. This is a super collar. This collar has worked well, not entirely eliminating your dog's barking, but painlessly distracting / annoying her after a couple of barks, and she stops. We didn't think it would work, but it has. This collar helped she silence. I so happy with this bark collar. Recommended.",1
I have an American Bulldog that destroys almost every toy we get her. We purchased this s December of 2017 and it is still in one piece. Happy.,1
"I tried Advantix II because I was told I should switch flea and tick treatments out every 6 months or so. I had used Frontline Plus for years and never had a problem but thought switching things up made sense so tried Advantix II. Big mistake.. Within a month of switching to Avantix II, fleas were all over our pets and house and what a very costly mess we had ridding ourselves of the bugs. I went back to Frontline Plus and all has been well since then.",0
I'm very dissatisfied with my purchase. The plants arrived slimy feeling and they all died within 1-3 days. My pond ph etc are perfect. Never will purchase again,0
no effect on my dog,0
"Very disappointed they got hot rather quickly and they caught hair making it pull. I had a set of A5

"The pad is too light weight and therefore, the dog can move it.  It needs to be straightened out all the time.  The dog pad was bought at Amazon.com.",0
Good value.  Works great with Richell Paw Trax Mesh Training Tray.,1
This item is not as advertised ... makes a complete mess everywhere and isn't fit for a normal 2 liter bottle - should of included a water dispenser that would fit properly into the hole to have the water dispenser to work properly !,0
"Saves me money by refilling the filter and it worked and cleaned the tank the same as the pre-made filters. This is my second bag and the first one lasted quite a long time.

My fish tank filter is not refillable so I carefully peeled the blue felt filter to about half way so I can empty the carbon inside and refill it. I have several of them (about 4) so I always have a fresh filter replacements. When dirty, i just use an old toothbrush and clean them under the faucet being careful not to spill the charcoal inside. I just dump it outside on my fruit trees as fertilizer then let it sun dried before refilling.

I also purchased a trim to fit filter pad after a while to put on top but not really necessary.",1
My dog refuses to use this.,0
Good price.,1
Paint is chipping after less than 2 months in tank,0
"I am VERY ""product sensitive"", so I CANNOT use ""Febreze"" products. At all.

I have needed to get rid of cat urine odors, and kitchen garbage can odors.

A friend of mine told me about Hogwash, and I won't buy anything else. Period.

Remove the garbage bag from the kitchen can, spritz Hogwash into the can, put new garbage bag in - NO ODORS!

Spritz the futon whenever I smell cat urine odor, and the odor is neutralized.

I do NOT itch or become red when I come into contact with this product - which is super fabulous because I do have that reaction to every other odor product I have ever used.

I'd love to put this product on ""autoship"", however it says it's unavailable and it's unknown when it will be back in stock. Shame. I consider it a necessity!",1
Used it for a litter of ten. It broke within 3 days,0
Arrived pitch black. Has not gotten any better after several days in my tank. HORRIBLE.,0

works great! Instant behavior response from my big female pup. Exceptional customer service.,1
"This is perfect for our 138 lb. Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. I ordered the XL---and was afraid that it wasn't going to be large enough, based on his girth measurements. But it is!!....and....there is room to spare. We adjusted it to fit his body. I like the extra feature that allows you to ""lock"" the buckle...so....no fear of it opening.  It is well constructed, seems durable, and it is so much better than any of the other ""flimsy"" harnesses I have tried.  Not only does our dog feel ""secure"", but we do, as well, when taking him for a walk. Gives you control...yet it is quite comfortable (and, I think, reassuring) for our large dog.  The price is more than excellent for this product.",1
This is my 2nd doggie seat I've had to buy. I like it that on this one the strap with the lobster claw that tethers my dog to the seat is longer so that she can't get out of her seat but I'm not struggling to unhook her.,1
"I just can't appreciate people offer copy cat products, and the quality is worst than the original design from ARGO pet carrier by teafco.  This carrier offered by Pet Life is completely a copy of ARGO Petascope carrier, which is also offered on amazon.com.  ARGO Petascope carrier offers a much better structure, color and style.  Such an embarrassing product offered by Pet Life.",0
"This is a product I really love, I actually am able to use it in our snail shower inside to utilize both hot and cold water.  It is
easy to assemble and convenient to store.",1
"So much easier to use than any other litter scoop used, and strong so it won't break like the plastic ones!!",1
This has helped dramatically reduce any litter mess after they use the box.  It is easy to dump back into the box when needed.  I would purchase again if needed and recommend to others.,1
I have a female Eclectus & she ate it/unraveled it in ONE day! the prblm seems to be where the white screw attachments are connected.. I think they're glued on over the braiding and wire they come off easily..,0
Sticking with fresh step,0
When the shipping is good on this (prime) you won't find a better deal anywhere...at least I haven't. A few dog food experts who research very closely the ingredients used and the processes used to make the food highly recommend Fromm. Very happy with the product and our dog loves it. I also trust in its quality.,1
"Ball is durable but it barely glows. Takes charging under an extremely bright light for several minutes before it even glows faintly. Even then, only one half of it will be glowing and it will dim out faster than it took to charge it. Pretty much useless for fetch at night, which is why I bought it. Dont know if I got a defective one but now Im gonna get one with an actual battery powered light.",0

This food doesn't contain sweet potato either, which is included in so many salmon ingredient dog foods. The sweet potatoes gave my little white dog, yeast infection ears and red paws.
The kibble is tiny, just the right size for little doggies. He is sensitive to chicken and beef, so I always look for fish based foods.
I'm going to try the whitefish next to rotate the protein, maybe venison?
Benefits: Increased energy and soft fluffy fur!",1
Worst purchase ever. Batteries have to be replaced several times a week and product does not work.,0
"The only thing that has been able to contain our strong, escape artist, australian shepherd.  He's a 60lb dog and has plenty of room inside the large cage.  However, his excessive drool is starting to peel the coating off the metal bars.  But I see others have had the same comment.  We are glad to have found a strong and safe containment for him.  The cage is very heavy, and the wheels are great for moving it around. I would recommend it to anyone whose dog can break out of regular crates.",1

"My cat had a runny/soft stool problem for a long time. We got him from the pound. He was adopted 3 times but was returned because of the runny/soft stool problem (he used to rub his butt on the carpet when he was soiled). During the first year we had him we took him to several vets, they wormed him, gave him several courses of antibiotic. It didn't work. We changed his diet with organic, sensitive stomach food. It didn't work either. We finally got some RunniPoo Relief. After 5 days of using RunniPoo Relief his problem is completely gone. We give him 3-4 drops in 1 tablespoon of wet food daily to maintain the good result. It's been about 6 months and still works.",1
Great for my babies!,1
"I have bought many bulk packs of pet waste bags from Amazon over the years and these are the best I have come across - a favorite. I do a search, read reviews, and try to get the most bags for my money each time I am due to buy more. These are thicker, stronger than others I have bought. They roll out smoothly, without issue. I have yet to have a bag tear or be damaged. They are a very good size. I will definitely be buying again!",1
Keeps my big dog's teeth busy and away from my furniture! Lasting well. Good value.,1
"Everything was great,Nessie",1
"I did a 20% water change. 2 days went by and added amquel plus into the tank, tested few hours later, still same level of nitrite. Then tested one more time the next day, same result. Does not work!

Not that didn't lower the nitrite readings but lower my ph which I had to use ph up to alter my water to the right ph, and I don't think that's healthy.

Don't recommend it at all, if you just want a conditioner, get api stress coat.",0
Shopping was pretty fast. Runs a little small . my chiuaha is 5 pounds and usually wears a medium it fit but was a bittt small. Overall for the price you can't beat it!!,1
"From the very moment we open it, the thru-way tube became the favorite toy of our ferret. Excellent product and quality.",1
"Like too many other cat toys, the mechanics here are too cheaply built.  The build quality is inline with the price, but it should be built at a much higher quality and sold at a higher price instead.

The motor is loud.  Loud.  As the mirror has a limited angular range, you have to put it up in high places to get the cats not running into anything harmful while chasing the laser.  With the loud noise, the cats will eventually hunt the source and knock this thing onto the floor.  It didn't last through many of those falls.",0
"I bought this so my dogs can carry their own gear when we take them hiking.  It is good quality, fits all four of my dogs who range from 45 pounds to 110, and seems to be comfortable enough not to bother them.  If you are tired of carrying all of your dogs items around then I would highly recommend this product.",1
My dog actually wants to have his teeth brushed every night.  He loves this stuff and it does a great job.,1

I cat loves it and I do too I have it in the bedroom near my bed and she sleeps on it every night,1

Works great and cheaper than the store.,1
really small,0
"This product did do what it said it would but I found that a prong collar does the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  If money is no object for you then purchase this for the comfort of your dog.  However, if you are economically challenged as I am, another type of lead shoud do as well.",0
"My husband was worried about the size, but the Large was just fine for our medium sized Lab. Seems quality and secure, and she likes to lounge in there even when we are at home. Very good value.",1
bought this for my oned kitten its nice,1
i love it and my dog too,1
"I have a regular recurring order of the rectangle bags, but my most recent order I was sent the curve edges with handles - this made it incredibly difficult to tear as the perforated parts of the bag are not straight resulting in many lost bags due to tearing the edges. The picture does not match the actual product I was delivered (rectangle bags are shown), but as I did not use the bags until more than 30 days after receiving the delivery I am unable to return it.

Why should I be forced to pay for something different to what I have ordered?!",0
"Bought 3 , one arrived cracked :(",0
"Great price for these, getting more",1
Great product that works just as it should! It makes walking my dog so much easier.,1
"The photo tells the story after 10 weeks of use.  I was not able to return because of Amazons 30 day return policy.  I did buy another one as my puppies accessories are of the same color from PetSafe hoping this might have been a fluke.  I will post results after using the new one.  As of this point, I do not recommend unless you want to purchase a PetSafe leash every 3 months.",0
Perfect for my chihuahua! She loves it! Houses her bed and toys with room to run around.,1
Great for Dogs Or Cats!!!,1
Works as described. Would recommend to anyone!,1
My 12 lb cat loves this!  It's his favorite place to take a nap in the window and watch the birds! Plus he actually uses it to scratch on. Wishing the mouse was held on more securely though considering he ripped it off the second he saw it.,1
"I think this made the paw situation worse.. maybe? I am not sure - it certainly wasn't a miracle worker - this is up close to Canada with a lot of COLD ice and snow, so maybe it is meant for less harsh conditions. . oh and a side note - my puppy, after his first taste, began to violently lunge at it, stare at it lustily from afar... sneak downstairs to find it to try and scarf down the entire tub of it - no idea why-- since it smells - well, inedible. Be prepared to hide it because it makes an expensive midnight snack.",0
This broke within two days. I emailed the company and haven't gotten a reply.,0

My 11lb puppy tore big chunks off of these keys in under 5 minutes.,0
"DO NOT GIVE YOUR DOGS THESE TOYS. PLEASE SHARE.
Don't do it. I have had Leila since she was 8 weeks old- just weened. She has NEVER has fleas, worms of any kind, she's always had her vaccinations, eats the best food (grains make her sick), and best treats. She doesn't get cook bones, rawhide, or anything that could hurt her. She doesn't chew on furniture, shoes, clothing, or anything that she shouldn't. The mistake I made was giving her a NylaBone. The regular one made her throw up shards of plastic, so I got her a Big Chew for avid chewers. Tomorrow she is going under anesthesia to have two molars excised because they were broken on this toy. I'm sick of dog toy and treat companies not being held accountable.",0
This is a good quality dog food - my girl loves it.,1
This cute costume is actually for my little girls stuffed tiger toy.  She wanted a Knight and shiny armour costume.  The price was right and its super cute.  She is going to love it on Christmas morning.  Thank you.,1
"I was worried about getting this, because I got another set for another seller and they are horrible. This one is amazing. The sand paper is a really good grade that is going to last quite awhile. I will defiantly be buying again.",1
Works great,1
The quality is good - fairly thick but not too thick. Only thing is the xsmall seemed rather small to us. I would purchase this a size larger because I thought the quality was good. I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars but not an option.,1
every bag has shown up delivered on the porch ripped and leaking dog food.,0
"I bought this for my 4 month old puppy yesterday after finding a few fleas on him. It was recommended by the pet store because it lasts 8 months its affordable and it has a good history of success. I put it on him around 1pm and around 9pm he started throwing up/dry heaving and shaking continuously until he had nothing left. Every time he took a drink of water he threw it up. He was falling asleep and having minimal movements/energy so we took him to the emergency clinic. The vet had never heard of this new collar and said it seemed too good to be true that its lasts 8 months. The vet thought that something that lasts 8 months is probably too strong for the safety of pets. We gave him a degreasing bath and an anti nausea shot. Today he is still sleeping and lethargic, much much more then normal and still will hardly eat but no longer throwing up. He's itching constantly which could be from fleas or maybe the collar- whatever it is I'm scared to put anything else for fleas on him until he's better. I don't have direct evidence that this was caused by the collar but he was perfectly fine all week until the evening after I put the collar on.
All this to say, I do not recommend the Seresto collar and I am looking for suggestions for safe alternatives to get rid of fleas.",0
Do not buy this product! It is inferior metal and the links are spotty workmanship. It broke after the second time in use after a gentle tug.,0
I have had hoofs in the past but these are not good. They are super thin and my 9lb dachshund puppy can break them in no time! They break into little pieces which are sharp and not safe. I stopped giving them to my dog because of the concern that a sharp shard could damage her esophagus,0
Cats loved it.,1
Bad... Material is junk and it has no bottom to catch my bunny's stool or urine.... The wood had cracks in it and its not made for the indoors... I think it would be good for outdoor use only... returned it the next and had to pay for shipping $19.70... BOO,0
Great carrier thanks.,1
My cats didn't like the taste of these.,0
"It's easy to break into smaller pieces, doesn't make my hands greasy, and is therefore a great training treat for my picky Border Collie. The healthy herbs and spices make it smell pleasantly to both dog and human. The natural ingredients are perfectly balanced (there's not just meat but also a little bit of potatoes, and my BC is happier with a mix of carbohydrates and protein).",1
Complete garbage.  Used it exactly two times are one of the black straps ripped off. Do not purchase. Waste of money.  Very disappointed.,0
"I purchased this product for my Golden Retriever but will be returning it. There are a few things that I don't like about this product.
1. You have to lift the top off to get to the food storage underneath. This means you have to empty the water if you don't want it sloshing around everywhere. I could have lived with this by cutting the bottom out from below the food bowl, however....
2. You can't use the storage aspect if you want the feeder to be 12"" tall. It only works at 8"" tall (and only holds 20lbs of food)and if you want it to be 12"" inches tall you invert the base which eliminates the storage. This was the deal breaker for me.
I do like the fact that the bowls are a good size and that they are stainless steel, however this is the easiest thing to change out if needed so it didn't make this product worthwhile in my opinion.",0
"messed up the flow, was difficult to set up. Idea is good, product was poor",0
Kitty loves it,1
Works when it wants to. Sometimes my dog will bark for 5 minutes before it beeps other times it won't beep at all. Had high hopes for this but I'm quite disappointed.,0
Works great on my older pug's infected ears. Better than the steroid creams prescribed by the vet.,1
Awesome size for amount paid.,1
"Horrible, just a textured, thin very soft foam pad with a very flimsy cover. Our dog will sleep on anything so it will do, but it was NOT worth $30.

We got two, this particular one (""forest"") came with a thread sticking out in the middle of the pad - which became a hole after the dog discovered it.",0

Open mouth design makes the filter pointless.,1
"Great! I love it! It's actually engraved not laser printed (some other sellers say it's ""engraved"" but it's not and you can scratch it off with your fingernail) and holds a lot of information. I used mine to put the microchip # and some other ID #s on it and they surprisingly fit on the medium size tag. I like having all information on one tag instead of having a separate tag for each #. I wish it were a bit cheaper (mine was ~$15) but I suppose you're paying for a good quality item.",1
Not very satisfied. The sifting liners are very thin and rip whenever you try to sift through. Waste of money and a very cheap product. Don't buy. You would have better luck just picking through it with a cat litter sifter.,0
"Poor quality.  Product comes in a plain white bag, not as shown.  I'm not sure it is even the same product.  The pellets have a stale smell and there are colored chunks of something in it that my pigs won't eat.",0
"Not happy at all with this litter box.  Have worked with it trying to make sure everything is secured tightly and still makes a mess.  When I turn it over to clean, I have a ton of litter to clean up.  I have read instructions and watched video and still cannot get it to work as advertised.",0
Great product. Bought size small but it was still way too big but I cut it and it works fine. The chemical smell is HORRENDOUS. I left it outside for a couple days and it still smells :/ I'm not sure if that's safe for my cat.,0
"I read all the reviews before purchasing this razor, which were all very good, but not great.  I want to leave a GREAT review.  I have never so easily been able to groom my long haired (Birman) cats before.  This razor works extremely well and I only had to make a couple of passes over the same section for it to be nice and even.  I like to shave my cats down considerably a couple of times during shedding weather.  It comes with 3 blades of different lengths (and several attachments, which I did not need to use).  I used the middle size blade and went with the growth of the hair and it made their hair nice and short without being tooooo short.  Another plus is that my cats get soooo stressed out by my (lovely but) very loud and talkative groomer.  When my husband and I did them ourselves, they peacefully lay there and let us work on them for 15 minutes each before they meowed even once.  Another plus is that it is not very loud.  It does ""buzz' but it's a quieter buzz than my groomer's razor.  It did get hot by the time I was halfway through with my second cat, so you might not want to do multiple animals without a break in between.  I am so very pleased with this product and I highly recommend it.",1
"I loved this in the photo, I was excited when it arrived, but so disappointed, it's so wobbly not sturdy at all, I want to return but my friend threw out the box, Bummed. Anyone know how I make this stable for my fur babies?",0
HORRIBLE design. Even if I bent the frame it would never be square enough to put the top on. Amazon should not be selling this defective product.,0
Very poor quality  my dogs shredded the naugihyde covering on the first night with there toenails  the material is so thin it did not stand up,0
Our rottie mix loves this suit. We got it to help keep diaper on her. With a very little nub for a tail it was hard to keep up her depends. She is a senior dog with an incontinence issue at night. Helps her keep her dignity around her 2 sister and 2 brothers.,1
"My 6 months old 15 lb Mal-Shi mix LOVES this and knows it's his when we take it off for bathtime. It's super comfy and he wears it all day and night and even sleeps with it. Since Tobi is still a puppy, it's easier for us to grab him when he's tryign to run away. Really want these in other colors since we love the beige so much!",1
not easy to change to water bowl,1
Batteries died after a week. Dog never shuts up.  Bought a high dollar bark collar instead.,0
Dimensions shown in Product Description differ from Product Details.,0
Love this bowl! It's been the only thing that's helped my dog slow down while eating up his food. Would highly recommend!,1
"I'm not exactly a fan of cats, but my sister can't live without them, and multiple cats in a small apartment can quickly get smelly.  Lugging giant bags of cat litter up three flights of stairs is no picnic either, so the lightweight stuff is a must.  With the added Glade scent, the not-as-heavy weight, and the giant pail size, this cat litter is about as good as it gets -- cuts down on odor, can handle a herd of cats in a tiny apartment, and doesn't require physical therapy after carrying it up all those stairs.  I'm still not sold on cats as pets, but this makes the idea a little more bearable.",1
My dog loves to chew and usually makes short work of raw hides.  These last better and are supposed to be safer.  The smell isn't intolerable but don't take a deep whiff when you open the box.  I will definitely buy these again as my dog loves them.,1
"The collar is a nice high visibility orange with our cat's name and our phone number embroidered on it.  It was delivered quickly and it's of the expected quality.  Text is quite clear and the embroidery seems to be decently done for the purpose. I've had some collars in the past that had the information printed on them and it just didn't last.

The breakaway latch appears to hold securely.  I've found neither a strangled cat nor a random collar laying around the house.  The bell is nice for tracking the cat's movement, handy when you don't want to step or trip on a cat at night.  Like most cats, it seems that 9pm to 2am is the ""bounce around like an idiot"" time and the bell has confirmed that.",1
Seems like poor design. The bracket that holds the bottle on the crate broke within 2 months with minimal use.,0
In the middle of the nightvthe hamster crewed off the blue cap on the top of the caged and got out then jumped about 7 feet from the top of some stairs,0
"If my Dog can speak he would say ""Awesome"",just by his body language you can see he is warm and comfortable .",1
This is a great car seat for the price i really love it.,1
Love it,1
If I could give 0 stars I would this product killed 2 of my dogs.  Please do not buy. We need to ban Hartz products thank you.,0
Doesn't really work :(  Absolutely no response,0
"poor little Piper, Norwich terrier puppy, very scrappy but was totally vanquished by the plastic collar of shame.  Had to take it off for food, water; couldn't navigate corners and chairs.  This took forever to arrive bc of Fed Ex snafu, but once here, one second to adjust too.  She wore it 24/7 for 2 more weeks, occasionally sitting down to try to lick spaying incision, but just couldn't reach. Vet totally impressed, now says she will recommend for all dogs.  Best $$ ever spent",1
"The product is not fresh, very stale, has no aroma remaining in it; I have 4 cats and none will react to it.",0
"Excellent well made cover for a dog crate, gives semblance of a private 'den'  atmosphere.",1
Used this on my two dogs and it didn't seem to help.  Both dogs continue to have fleas and constantly are scratching.  I have tried to applications over two months time.  Don't think it is worth the money.,0
This solved the problem of the enthusiastic litter kicker. I was worried my cat wouldn't use it but he took to it right away.,1
"At first my dogs didn't know what to do with the large beds, but they soon figured out they were very comfortable.",1
"Best way to clean dog's teeth, and give them a treat whilst doing so.  Saves a lot of money on teeth cleaning.
My dog is 4 years old, and the vet says her teeth are great.  No tarter, or problem with her gums.
She weighs 20 lbs, and I give her half a Large size every single day.
I buy the Large size, and then break them in half.  It is cheaper this way.  They are easy to break.
Do not give more than the recommended dosage. I accidently did one day, and she got loose stools. . Won't do that again.",1
My kitty is entertained!,1
Dog seems to like,1
"I used these pads for my elderly diabetic cat, who developed incontinence when she had cancer.  They worked well.  They did not leak, they helped save my couch and my carpet, and helped keeping my home from smelling like cat pee.  I frequently found better prices and equally good quality at local stores, though.",1
Great product,1
"My vet recommended this to me, and it definitely helps keep my dog's ears clean.  I'm not sure how others are applying it, but (per my vet), I soak a cotton ball with it, stick it in my dog's ear, fold over his ear, and massage for a few moments.  Usually within seconds of removing the cotton ball, he shakes his head, which flings out all the extra. Yes, all over you. But because of the massage, some stays in the ear canal.  My dog hasn't had any negative reaction to it.

I didn't realize it was supposed to smell like apples until I read the other reviews, and it definitely doesn't. I never really considered the smell. It's not entirely pleasant, but it's not unpleasant, either.",1
Won't last with a chewer. Might be my fault for not reading specs.,0
"The Premier Manners Minder allows you to offer your dog a food reward without you having to be near the dog.  You click a remote and a piece of kibble drops into the bowl.  I bought it for a specific purpose.  I do the sport of Agility with my Shelties, and I am using the Manners Minder to train my dogs to complete obstacles no matter where I am. It is an excellent tool for this rather limited purpose.
I think that using the MM to train polite behaviors -- which is the emphasis in the MM material -- is, in some cases, rather clunky.  It's much easier to teach a dog to touch your hand, for instance, by providing a ""Yes"" and an immediate treat than to have the dog run to the MM.",1
"My dog loves these, and even better they are made in the USA with no by products",1
Does its job,0
"They're ACTUALLY legal again! Horrors!!!, July 9, 2007
By  Kitty (Sacramento, CA United States) - See all my reviews
These tiny torture/death cages were made obsolete decades ago. By means of stopping the source of the problem. Badly needed laws were finally brought forth. To curtail any legal trafficking of these poor turtles. The very real concern, of the transmission of Salmonella to young children, (as well as anyone handling these turtles), being the main concern cited.
Salmonella can be fatal to children, or the immune compromised. Not to mention simply horrible to suffer, even if you're in perfect health.
The breeders who acquire the ridiculously meager profits from the selling of these turtles. Have no morals, whatsoever.
They are not just hurting wild populations of turtles, (as many get dumped in local water spots and out-compete native species for food and resources). But, in more cases than not, they are sentencing turtles, and families, naive enough to go for this, ""product"". Much heartache, and likely suffering.
These turtles become the size of dinner plates, in a few short years. They are overwhelming animal rescues in every corner of the country.
If you must have one. Please check with your local shelters, or herp. rescue groups. There are literally thousands, in desperate need of homes.",0
I ordered and received two tags for my dog. I got exactly what I was looking for.,1
"Seems to detangle well, but the scent is so overpowering it has the concentration of perfume or cologne. Unfortunately unusable.",0
no more ear infections!,1
My dog lives the jerky but many were broken and I can get it much cheaper elsewhere.,0
This product did not work well for us.  My dog is white. It turned her fur black on her neck.  I have ordered different ones.  I use these to tag her belongings while traveling but I would not use this on my pet.,0
All of my kittys like this treat. Arrived in good shape.,1
"We were having lots of difficulty with our cat, Harley.  He was having chronic diarrhea and we didn't know what to do.  My husband's mom recommended a pro-biotic, so I looked on the web and found this.  And within 48 hours we had a new cat.  And now we have less mess and are oh, so happy!  It truly is worth the money.",1
"In choosing which products I would like to purchase on Amazon, I've noticed that most product descriptions are very vague or misleading. For example this product. How big is ""regular""?  Regular size for a mouse or regular size for a rat?  Why is it so hard to put at least the diameter of the wheel in the description?  I'm not going to buy a product like this unless I have more information.",0
"I was extremely disappointed to find out that I could not use this on a regular grooming table without spending $125.00++ to use it.  Be careful before you purchase; it has to be used with an expensive ""starter kit"".",0
"I wanted a water bowl for my dog's playpen that wouldn't get knocked over when he's messing around. This can be attached securely to the fence around the playpen, and does not get knocked over or gets stuff in it because it's not on the ground. It's simple, easy to use, and effective for the purpose I needed. You don't have to remove the attachment when you want to clean it - just lift the bowl off and place it back after cleaning and refilling.",1
It was very good for my dog,1
Awesome really Nice,1
should have listened to other reviews - why did i waste 30 bucks for this thing?,0
Was exactly as described and expected.  Would purchase from this vendor again.,1
"Used this pack 3 times and after the second time the seams on the bottom of the pockets started to separate. It's currently in transit back to the seller. It's a cute pack and fit well, but unless you plan on just using it for looks and not as an actual working pack, don't bother.",0
Only took my dog 3 days to completely chew off the top of this toy.,0
Tonya likes these and they are healt hy,1
"Using only 15 watts, I didn't expect much heat. I purchased two. One for each cat penthouse. I wrapped each bed warmer in a rug and placed in the penthouse. The bed stays warm to the touch and the cats love them.",1
"This ball has the strength of a 2 liter bottle. It is so flimsy it won't even stay snapped together. Also, this is false advertising, the only rodent that will fit inside is a baby mouse....3 inches across...maybe.....terrible product. And there is no option to return it. ",0
"Great for my cat, holds the liner in place and keeps litter inside. I found what i needed!",1
"I bought this because my rabbit tosses her litter boxes around the cage!????! And by looking at the clips I thought for sure it would STAY in place!? Nope those little round pieces are worthless for staying! But in all fairness I have not found one yet that attaches to the pen!!! Why is this not available??? So I duck taped it down to the floor and solved the problem, the clips ARE good for keeping the back down so the tape works better by just taping the front! I am going to get Velcro and stick it to the ground so its removable to clean!!!",0
"We have 3 tabby cats that knead and curl up on comforters, etc.  They lay on windowsills in our hot South Florida summers, so I thought this would be great. No! None of them liked it, in fact, they avoided it. So after 2 weeks, it went in the trash",0
"""Large Pig Ears"" is obviously a relative term, however if these were there largest pig ears in the bin at my local pet store I would not buy them..also the quality is not their same..  less smoke smell and they feel like hard plastic..  definitely will not buy again..",0
my dog loves it!!!!!!!!! I think is almost time to buy another one :),1
"I bought these because you got two for $40.00.
One seemed to work great, but how would I know, this was my first time buying anything like this. So I put it on the one dog he was sitting with me and barked at the door bell (they are suppose to zapp when the dog barks and it did) I heard the zapping noise and it didn't stop, his front legs went out stiff as a board I hurried and took the color off. I think it darn near killed him. It seemed like some times the zapp was week and in this case very strong, I know there are three different zapps depending on which button you push, but in this case I didn't push any button on the remote.
The second one didn't work at all. They came with batteries which was even a better deal it seemed. So I switched the batteries around. Messing with them for about two weeks, then none worked at all. I went to radio shack bought 2 new batteries at $4.00 ea. (They are a hard to find little battery) Didn't make any difference. I had to send these back.
I am going to buy the one at pet smart for $80.00 and compare the difference. But I really do need two, one for each dog.",0
unfortunately my assassin snails won't have anything to do with these pellets - and neither will my tank of tetras,0
"One of my cats has a problem with grinding her teeth and obsessively chewing on her nails. I was hoping this toy would get her attention to chew on something other than herself since she loves catnip, but it was a dud. The catnip isn't potent enough and the tassels aren't enough to entice them to want to play with it.",0
"I agree with some of the other reviews.  The KONG brand has always had a line of strong, durable, toys that a lot of us dog owners have learned can be a life saver. We trust their products to stand up to MOST of our chewers.  This particular toy is definitely not meant for any dog that is considered a ""powerful chewer"".  If you actually feel the material, compared to the red or black three-tiered kong toy, this material is almost.. well mushy.  It's soft.  Nowhere near what the other kongs are made of.  I will tell you, I do like the idea of interlinking the two types to make it more difficult for the really smart pups.  But if your really smart pup is a really serious chewer, don't even try it.

You're probably wondering why I rated this toy so high.. I actually use this to feed my Beagle.  I put his meal into the Genius and he tosses it around and eats the kibble as it falls out.  He destroys food.. in like.. 30 seconds.  I tried the brake-fast bowl-which he just figured out how to tip over.  I tried feeding smaller meals throughout the day, he still eats like he will never eat again.  After seeing Marley & Me, I don't want to take any chances.  This gets him to slow down to the speed I feel is appropriate.  After about 8 months, it gets warn and the food falls out in larger quantities, so it will need to be replaced.  I am on my third one in almost 3 years, and I will continue purchasing this product.  (It's actually funny, if I give him a bowl of food now, he looks at me like.. ""What am I supposed to do with that?"")",1
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR NEARLY THREE MONTHS,THIS TIME MY CATS BEGAN FOAMING AT THE MOUTH. I HELD MY CATS AND BEGAN TO PANIC WHIPPING THE SALIVA FROM THEIR MOUTHS. AFTER TRYING TO SOOTHE MY CATS I GAVE THEM A BATH. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR ANIMALS!!!!!",0
Exactly what i needed,1
I ordered 3 different kinds of Nylabone dental chews and all were dried up and crumbling.  Also had a bad smell,0
I have not ordered this but the image in the picture is of a veggie clip. I have one of these at home. That is in no way shape or form a gravel vaccuum. I am not sure where the mistake is. It might be the wrong picture or it might be the wrong product description. Not sure which but it needs to be fixed.,0
"I bought this leash so I could work on recall with my dog (35lb lab mix). I wasn't sure what type of leash would be best (30ft? 50 ft? wide? thin?), but this leash has been great and I'm glad I chose it.

I was afraid the cotton leash wouldn't be sturdy enough, or that my dog would easily chew through it, so I'm glad I went with a nylon leash. It seems very durable and I am not nervous of the leash breaking, even if my dog is pulling. The metal clasp for connecting to my dog's harness seems sturdy, too.

The 3/4 inch width works out well - being a long leash, it's not impossible for it to get tangled, but it's wide enough that it's hard to knot tightly. This means getting out any tangles is pretty easy. The length is also good for working on recall - 30ft is plenty far enough for my dog to wander around. I wouldn't mind a 50ft leash, but I feel like it might be a bit unruly, as a 30ft leash is easy enough to trip on if my dog is zooming about.

Overall I am very happy I decided to buy this leash for recall work/playing in an open field. The only improvement I would want in this leash is a different colored hand loop - with a long leash, especially if it wasn't wound up properly, it can be hard to find the loop. Plus it'd be nice to be able to see that the loop is secure around my hand, not just excess leash.

If you want to practice recall with your dog, or would like to let your dog run more freely on leash in an open area, this should do the trick!",1
needed a 6ft lead for my little 18 lb. corgi/doxie mix & this was a fun colorful one. Clip appears to be working acceptably & he looks cute with it.,1
"The toy looks and feels fun but it smells really bad. When I first opened the package it made the entire room smell! I washed it in the sink and then in the laundry, but the smell never really went away. When we did give it to the puppy, he wouldn't even touch it. After smelling it, he doesn't even want to lick or play it with. A real bummer.",0
Worked for a couple days and then my dogs ignored it.,0
Not quite big enough for a 15lb cat adn more litter over the floor than in the box,0
"My Miniature Schnauzer had been suffering from dermatisus or something itchy for years.  The only relief he got was his ONCE A YEAR Prednisone shot, because I know how toxic it is.  Anyway, I got this and can't believe it is working so well.  I do the whole shooting gallery of Nzymes, grain free food, and special shampoos, and this little $8 bottle works.  I do wish it came in a larger size.",1
I LOVE THESE LITTLE TIES  AND FAST SERVICE..,1
"My dogs FAVORITE outside toy!!  I say outside because it is big (we have Large) and heavy and would likely destroy furniture if used in the house.  We love this for fetch outside because it's weight allows it to fly far.  My dog loves to grab it and shake it.  And she LOVES it when her little sister plays tug of war with her with this toy.  It is super well made seems indestructible!!
We love it so much when we lost ours once - I immediately bought another (we did find it eventually once the snow melted!!).  Now i have one in the car and one for the yard.",1
I liked the setup of this cage!! But what u don't know and they don't show is that the bottom is mesh material so u either have to put it on the floor or put a piece of wood underneath the place u will out your cage!,1
It did not read the chip and instead terrified my dog,0
"It's really small, definitely not for medium or large size dog. I could of made this myself.",0
"Puppies love em and it keeps them busy for awhile. They do kinda stink, probably why they like them so much. If you can handle the smell, they are well worth it.",1
What I wanted.,1
"Let's start being saying that I have an Australian Shepherd.  She loves this toy!  It hasn't left her side since we got it 2 days ago.  No toy has lasted three the wrath of my dogs intense playing.  This one sadly isn't making it either.  At this point, the squeeker is out, most of the stuffing is out and there are pretty big holes.  I gave it 4 stars simply because she loves this toy.  Even though it isn't going to last I plan to buy another one.",1
I ordered this on Tuesday and it arrived on Friday.  I unpacked it and put it in my dog's crate on Saturday at 10:00 AM.  By noon it was ripped to shreds (see picture).  Don't know what caused him to do this as he has not ripped up any of the other pillows or blankets that I have given him.  Fastest $20 I ever lost (including my trip to the casinos!).,0
"I wish I was not in a place in my life where I could provide feedback on this product. Alas- that is just not the case. This stuff is amazing. I have used it frequently while training a little dog to use a doggy door. It really does work miracles. I have friend lots of products but none work like this. I do think it is kind of gross when I have a little pile of sand-like stuff on my floor, but it is WAY better than what the sand is sucking up from my carpets. I highly recommend. It does have a kind of a bleachy smell, not too strong though. I leave it on accidents until it is back to the normal color, about 24 hours. I have found it is more successful if the stain is a bit damp before putting the product down.",1
"This litter box doesn't work as advertised, don't waste your money",0
Calming collars were okay.  I don't like to use things like this and have since trained my dog with better manners.  I am sure there are some dogs that may need them and that is good they are available.  There are no quick and easy answers and with time many issues were resolved with my dog.,1
You can see the real bacon in the product,1
"The bag says the Regular size is suitable for dogs 25-30 pounds but my 40lb cattle dog mix eats these things in three bites. I'm sure 3 bites isn't much dental care but that may be a dog issue more than a Greenies issue. The blueberry scent is pretty intense so if you or your dog are not fond of the smell of blueberries try another flavor.
5 stars because my dog loves them and because they did work well when she was a bit smaller and not so ravenous. I'll try the next size up next time!",1
The blue is not as bright as the green led light.  I am really impressed with this product and looks great with a black dog.  I would not recommend this product for a small dog.  I have a Pomeranian and I wish I could order this product for him.  The leash is a little long and would drag with a small dog.  I would buy this again.  I LOVE that they sent out an extra set of batteries.  Very well thought out and super happy!,1
This is a great pump for smaller nano reefs like mine. It gives a good amount of water movement to my corals and works great but I wouldn't use one in a tank larger then 20 gallons.,1
"My crested geckos loved these, however I had to take them out of both of my enclosures, I have 2 because  the started growing what seemed like mold, I guess from the mistings, just wish it came with a don't use with water warning",0
"Fits poorly. Jack Russel dog, loose around neck, right around middle, not adjustable enough. Stated that it came with the seat belt attachment, it certainly did not.",0
My cat really enjoys this food.  Other brands have made her vomit but not this one.  My dog likes it too;/,1
"Does the job, and looks great on my dog!",1
"This product is GREAT!!!  I use it in combination with a Barkbay harness.  My dog is an ENGLISH BULLDOG and I must be extremely careful of her neck as you probably know their short necks are predisposed to compression and serious injury.  I have two knee replacements and don't run.  Neither do I move too quickly.  When I open the door to let her out in the morning she used to BOLT out and I was at her mercy especially in winter when the steps to my apartment was ice covered.  The Woofiy leash gives us both the amount of play we need to remain on our feet. I don't use the waist belt strap for running or biking.  However, when we sit on the patio I secure her to the fence slat with the belt strap and attach her Barkbay Harness to the leash.  This allows her to roam around while knowing when she has to stop without jerking her to a neck-breaking stop.  Bulldogs are Powerful Pullers and the Woofiy leash is a great tamer without injury",1
It broke as soon as my dog pulled in it!  What a ripoff!,0
"Prevue Pet Products Multi-Color Small Pet Playpen is perfect for smaller animals like our hamster, or ferrets, guinea pig, etc. Well ferrets might knock it over or climb over it. It's so cute it's like a baby sized play area for fur babies. It allows us to get some contact with our hamster without worrying about hamster proofing the house or other things blocking our access to him.",1
Hard to open and literally the worst smell ever.,0
These are so tasty to my dogs that giving them medicines is a piece of cake!  The dogs see the pill pockets come out of the fridge and they run over to me excitedly to take their meds!,1
"The product itself is fine. My biggest complaint that in the title (as the photo eludes to) it say STICKS, not stick, but STICKS. I see that I am not the only one to make this complaint, but at least that customer got more than 1 in their pack. I also weighed the product, I understand packaging weighs something, the shipping weight states 8 OZ , which leads me to believe my just barely 3oz bully stick was supposed to weigh more or I was supposed to get more. Amazon I implore you to rectify the situation with myself and other customers , and correct the description to avoid future complaints.",0
Product was as it said it was. My one dog is a chewer and usually destroys toys in minutes. He is only 18lbs. but brutal on toys. Kong rubber toys have been the only thing he has not destroyed as of yet and he loves to play with them.,1
"This was not to best option for an automatic litter box despite the good reviews. The litter easily gets clumped and stuck on the bottom, causing me to have to scoop. The automatic part leaves large pieces in the litter box also. I have a small cat and she barely seems to have enough room to use the litter box. I would not order this product again. I am very disappointed in the performance of the litter box.",0
"This is very finely ground and not leafy like most other catnip. My cats always sneeze, at first, when I give it to them. They always waste a lot of it because it so finely ground. I will probably put the rest in an old sock to play with to avoid the mess.",0
makes my dog look very butch. great attention getter.,1
Batteries died too fast,0
Love this bag! Bag doesn't fall in and the holder stays tight to the leash!! And it's light! Way better than the hard plastic ones that flop everywhere,1
Not very sturdy. My 9 year old French Bulldog ripped open the seams and took most of the stuffing out. And she doesn't usually chew through things.,0
Loudest filter I have ever encountered !!!,0
"Perfect size, cute, and tucks everything away. It also lets our pooch get things out that she wants to play with.",1
The squeaker on ours broke within minutes and there's something rattling inside. Now it's a dud as far as our dog is concerned.  He would have had a better time playing with a ten dollar bill instead of the ten bucks we spent on this thing. No more Nerf toys for us.,0
"I bought this for my Miniature Schnauzer who is a 4 year old male. I bought the XXX Large so that it would go halfway down his legs and cover all of his back. It's soft and didn't shrink after I washed and dried it in the dryer. He can pee & poop while wearing it. Just make sure not to cover his tail. He turns heads and brings many smiles to faces as we walk down streets & in parks. The price & quality is great. He's an unpaid canine model!! (My pictures uploaded sideways, though they aren't sideways in my phone.)",1
"It simply lets ants into the feeder. See product pictures. I saw no effect whatsoever, nada, zero, zilch. What more can I say?",0
I was encourage to try these...by my breeder.  My one year old corgi puppy got extremely sick; throwing up and diarrhea.  The vet said this is common and that these products are not good for your dogs internal organs.,0
"Any manufacturer that gets to this point isn't one I want to ever trust

FDA Takes Action Against Teva Animal Health Inc.
Company fails to adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a consent decree of permanent injunction filed today, that prohibits Teva Animal Health Inc., its president, and two principals from its parent company, from manufacturing and distributing adulterated veterinary drugs. The injunction, once entered by the court, will prevent the defendants from manufacturing and distributing veterinary drugs until they achieve compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and obtain FDA approval.

""Good manufacturing practice standards are the backbone of product quality and the instrument on which the FDA relies most heavily for assurance that veterinary drug products are safe and effective,"" said Bernadette Dunham, D.V.M., Ph. D., director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.

During inspections between 2007 and 2009, the FDA found significant cGMP violations at Teva Animal Health's facilities, located in St. Joseph, Mo.

Under the terms of the consent decree, Teva Animal Health cannot resume manufacturing and distributing veterinary drugs until adequate methods, facilities, and controls are established and an independent expert inspects the facilities and procedures and certifies that they comply with cGMP. The FDA also will also inspect Teva Animal Health's facilities as needed before authorizing the company to resume operations. If, after resuming operations, the defendants fail to comply with any provision of the consent decree, cGMP, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA may order the company to stop manufacturing and distributing veterinary drugs, recall the products, or take other corrective actions.

 ""The FDA will not tolerate the manufacture and distribution of adulterated animal drugs,"" said Michael Chappell, the FDA's acting associate commissioner for regulatory affairs. ""Veterinarians and pet owners can be assured that the FDA will investigate and take regulatory actions against companies that produce animal drugs under conditions and controls that are inadequate to assure their safety and quality.""

In the event of future violations, the consent decree also subjects Teva Animal Health to payments of $20,000 for each day the defendants fail to comply with any provision of the decree and an additional $25,000 for each shipment of veterinary drugs in violation of the decree, up to $7.5 million per year.",0

Good stuff dog loves it,1
This works great!! Have done many trims. I like that it is rechargeable. It holds its charge for awhile.,1
Product was crushed into dust.,0
I have looked all over for this bag and this is the best buy I have found so far when it showed up I was more than happy with it. it is going to be perfect. this is much better than the picture showes. and the price can not be beat...,1
They sewed the strap in the wrong place and it's not able to be positioned properly because of that. I will be returning it,0
This came to me and was shattered,0
Dog loves these treats - I cut them into smaller pieces for rewards also,1
My cat love it. The bowl is always empty.,1

"I love this collar and it looks snazzy on my basset hound pup! The only issue I have is that the leash and the collar don't come in red like the harness does. I wanted a matching set for their red harness that I bought (and absolutely love), but for some reason they have all the other colors except red. Again, great product that I bought in black, but make a red one!!",1

I like it,1
My cat actually lays on this. She doesn't normally lay on beds. Love the sage green color. Would recommend this product.,1

"Worst purchase off this site! Don't buy, doesn't work. Rating should be 0 but had to give one just to post.",0
Product arrived in good shape.  I've been using Petrodex Enzymatic Poultry Flavored Toothpaste on my two mixed breed terriers for about 3 years.  They seem to enjoy getting their teeth brushed and the vet remarked that their teeth looked very good.,1
Worthless,0
Says waterproof but our dogs broke both within firsts week of having it. Could never get a hold of company was sent to answering machine. Wouldn't recommend this item.,0
Worked well the first few times I used it until the head of the brush completely broke off rendering it useless.,0
"This product has great ingredients and I gave our newly adopted dog the recommended dosages. However, she always had lots of very fragrant flatulence, to the point of clearing the room. By eliminating now one thing, then another, from her diet for a few days, I discovered that the Nupro was the culprit. Too bad - I wanted to like it.",0
SO CUTE!,1
"I purchased a small for my dog with a 20 inch chest and it fits wonderfully. I love that the neck strap has a buckle so there's no need to put the harness over the head in case you have a dog with a medical issue that won't allow it, or if you simply find it's easier for you.

Another thing I love is that the body straps are placed far back enough so that they don't rub against my dog's armpits when walking/running therefore there's no irritation in those sensitive areas, so my dog is as comfortable as can be.

I chose this harness for biking, and I 100% recommend this. The chest piece does not restrict natural shoulder movement, and boy can this thing reflect light. There's a front leash attachment for dogs that pull when walking, so that's also a plus.

All in all, a great harness. I can't say how sturdy it is yet, but so far so good. I think it was money well spent.",1
"Not safe for cats.  This will not stay on window.  I followed all instructions, cleaned the window, cleaned the suctions, tried different windows, it falls off from a few minutes later to a few hours later.  My cats must sense the instability of it, so thank goodness they didn't even try to use it.  I threw the box away before I realized it was junk so I am trying to figure out how to recycle the parts for something else.",0

"Unique Arts 14-Inch Hanging Birdbath, Copper Finish
Before purchasing this bird bath I was using a plastic flowerpot with a ceramic saucer stuck in the top. The goldfinch loved drinking from it because they could stand on the rim and drink from the shallow pool. I even had a brown-headed cowbird take a long bath in it. So I figured bigger is better and purchased this bird bath. So far, not a single visitor and it's been a week. The goldfinch still use my improvised bird bath and ignore this one. I think  that the problem is that the rim is difficult to grasp, the bottom is not flat and its too deep when filled with water to the rim. This birdbath will become a yard ornament and my improvised bird bath will stay. Too bad because it's a beautiful piece, well constructed and quality materials.",0
Cat ignores it,0
These bones almost killed my dog. I have a seven pound papilion. A piece got lodged in his duodenum and he had to have emergency surgery. I contacted the company and they emailed with me until they got the bet report supporting that the bone was the cause. I have heard nothing since. Do not buy these for your dogs!!,0
Bought this for my daughter's baby guinea pig. It was easy to put together. It is great that the base is deep so the bedding & hay don't fall out of cage. Simple to wash just take top half off and place on ground and put the guinea pig inside while you clean the bottom half. She had no problem using the ramp but within a week just jumps up onto top deck! I saw some negative reviews but I'm glad I bought this one because it has been a great cage.,1
Love it!  Nice and gentle.,1
works great,1
"Good size, very durable, exciting cluck! Lol",1
I have three cats one of which needs special food.  She picked at this but it was definitely not a favorite.  Of four types I have tried this was the least favored.,0
Fell apart after a few months of light use and 2 washings.,0
I got this to help with spills from the dog and the kids filling up the dog bowl. It hold the bowl in place nicely and the no slip function keep his bowls in place while he eats and drinks to help eliminate spills. The cute design is defiantly a nice touch as well. It shipped just days after my order and it was exactly as expected. I wouldn't recommend for too large of dog bowls as it is only 19L X 13W if you want to see the design that is. If you got 2 though it would be perfect for a large bowls.,1
"Love Victor, have bought it before. Would always recommend! Great dog food.

The shipping not so much. Got the box and dog food was falling out the sides and the tape on the box was in rough shape. Opened the box, to find the bag ripped open at the top. Got it out and I weighed the bag and it was 4 pounds off.",1
"We have gone through a few of these, not because they are deficient in any way, but because we use them constantly.  The spring that holds the pouch open is what eventually fails, but if not mishandled it is good for many, many cycles. I haven't seen anything else that works as well for dispensing training treats.",1
My almost 10 month old puppy loves to play with this rope. He's a bit of a biter due to he is only playing with us. He has toys but they are much smaller and he loves to play tug with them and he ends up biting us somewhat. I purchased this rope and he is crazy over it. He loves to play tug and we are not bitten accidently. Great product and am very pleased with it. Thank you.,1
"I was so disappointed. The millet had shed all over the box and looked old and dry.
Not nice fresh millet as expected. I would not recommend this company.",0
Not working well.,0
"I purchased this for our GSD so she could come inside out of the elements whenever she needed to.  We hired a handyman to install it and he did an excellent job.  However, I never got to inspect the door before it was installed, and I believed the title and description that this was an aluminum dog door...silly me.  I believe the manufacturer is using deceptive marketing to sell this dog door.  It should not be sold for over $20.  There is a (presumably) aluminum frame that the plastic flap is attached to, and that's where it ends.  The telescoping portion is very thin plastic as well as the portion of frame that the screws go through to mount on wall.  After two weeks of use, my dog had torn it completely out of the wall while we weren't home and chewed the telescoping portion to shreds.  Unfortunately since this is installed at a second home, by the time this occurred it was well past Amazon's return period.  I'm out a large chunk of money with a big hole in my wall and my wallet to show for it.  I trusted Amazon and PetSafe and will not again.

In addition, when it is windy both flaps blow open even though there are magnets to supposedly prevent that.  If you plan to have this on a wall that leads inside your house, do not expect it to keep out elements.

I do not recommend to anyone to buy this product.  It is nowhere near worth the price.  This is a low quality product.  Even if someone has a dog that doesn't chew and is gentle and lightweight, I would still not recommend it based on wind blowing it open.

[Edited to add photos.  Please notice the plastic portion that you screw onto the wall.  All eight were easily pulled through, the screws still remain firmly in the wall.  100% of the attachment points failed easily. The tearing of the plastic tunnel portion happened after the door was pulled off of the wall, and she assumed this was now a new chew toy.  With a good installation (like we had) I don't believe that the plastic tunnel portion would be a failure point.  However, the plastic frame that attaches to the wall is extremely prone to failure.  In the very least there should be metal reinforcement here.  After now going through many reviews, it is obvious that the company has known for a few years that this was a problem.  They've chosen to not improve the product or to clearly and truthfully state what their product is made of.  Too bad I didn't have the time when I needed to purchase this item to thoroughly go through all of the reviews (and really, I shouldn't have to).]",0
Made of an easy-to-tear fabric that didn't last 24 hours.,0
Our darling cats love this food--and we like the packaging and convenience. The Nature's Recipe Culinary Favorites Wet Cat Food is a nice choice. It smells nice and the nutrition content is impressive.,1
This product was not as good as I'd hoped. The bags are small and the flashlight is useless and stopped working almost immediately.,0
This little collar/bow tie is absolutely adorable!!  Perfect fit for my 12lb doxie. He'll be the best dressed pooch at our wedding for sure. The bow tie is removable from the collar thanks to a Velcro strip. We just love it!,1

"Whle he initially liked the food, about a quarter through he stopped eating it and I had to obtain different chow.",0
"My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.
I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.
I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.
I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.",0
I bought these to go with the SmartKat hot pursuit cat toy but they don't fit. Amazon have me a refund.,0
Both of my cats hate this treat,0
"Disappointed liners were not all cotton, my dog is allergic to synthetics",1
"Perfect service and perfect treat and, of course, perfect dog!",1
Lasted 3 months at 10 hrs per day.,0
I guess you get what you pay for. I honestly think that the $14.99 price is asking too much for the quality of this product. The wood was very cheap and cracked very easily. The adjustment was either too tight or too loose and didn't fit in either place I tried to place it. I did give it 2 stars as I received this product very quickly. I returned this product the next day.,0
"I have purchased numerous variations of stakes. There are several competitors to this product that have a similar design in that you are basically pushing a metal anchor into the ground attached to a length of cable. The general design is phenomenal and works much better than the majority of the stakes out there. However, this particular brand is terrible. A two-piece, incredibly flimsy Rod is provided that you screw together and attach into the anchor temporarily so you may hammer and drive the anchor about 20 inches into the ground. The amount of force necessary in order to drive the anchor down deep enough bends, and then eventually breaks the temporary Rod at the screwed in point. We then attempted to use only one half of the screw-in rod to continue trying to get the anchor down into the ground. We watered the ground extensively to make sure it was as soft as could be. The installation rod then wedged itself into the anchor so that it cannot be removed. So now my options are to dig a hole and remove the entire device and pitch it in the trash, or leave it in the ground, unable to finish installing it because there is nothing left to hammer down onto and have about 7 inches of a skinny metal pole sticking out of the ground for the dogs to tangle themselves around and potentially hurt themselves. Please do not buy this product. Purchase one of their competitors. The design is an A+, but this product is terrible.",0
"these things were hard as rocks, my dog coud not eat, and I could even crush it.",0
"This seems like a good leash so far, but it is not what the photo shows.  I have used flexi leashes in the past, both the corded versions and the tape.  The two tape versions I have owned have broken where the tape attached to the clip.  I never had this problem with the older corded version.  I purchased this one because the picture shows a cord.  This is not what I receieved.  I'm willing to keep this one because the attachment of the tape to the clip looks more robust and I was unable to find a corded leash for my 80+lb dog.  I searched high and low.  If it tears off like my old ones I would obviously change my rating.",1
Love this!  Recently got 2 more cats (3 total) and 1 is a long hair.  I really didn't think about how much more shedding that would be.  This works great.  The babies took a little while to get used to it but my old girl loves it.  Can't believe how much fur it pulls out!  Buy it!,1

Not only did it not work but it is hard to apply having so much liquid to apply.  It irritated his skin and has given no help to prevent fleas.  Will go back to my vetand pay more.

"I purchased this item, as I thought -- ""what a great idea"" BUT....this product looks good in theory -- but does not work well at all.  The bags do not stay on the end of the handle very well (I've tried using a rubber band to help hold it in place). The handle is very large (in order to accomodate the waste that needs to flow through it into the bag)- thus making it VERY hard to hold and control.  The worst thing, though, is the bag actually ""drags through"" the litter box while trying to scoop up the waste, and when it becomes filled, it's even worse.  Ewwww!  Once I use up the bags, I'll go back to my ""old"" Feline Pine scooper.  :(",0

To the human eye, the picture quality is HD on Cat Dreams....one of my cats actually jumps up in the entertainment center and paws at the pictures.  The sound track could use more variety.

"I ordered this because I had taken in a stray kitty that was infested with fleas.  I thought I'd give it a shot because she was still a kitten, too young for the medicines.

At first I tried a light spray, as directed, and rubbed it into her fur.  The next morning there was no change.

So I applied it again, this time a little heavier.  The next morning there was still no change.

Just to see what would happen, I turned her over on her back and checked her stomach, which is white.  I could see the fleas there.  I doused the upper half of her stomach with the spray and watched.  I didn't see any reaction from the fleas.  They were all still alive and it didn't seem like they were particularly bothered by the spray.  I expected to see them frantically trying to leave the area, but they weren't.

I really wanted it to work, but now I'm not sure where all the good reviews are coming from.  I have to say it does not work.  Unfortunately, natural is rarely effective.  Too bad.",0

It's a nice sturdy stainless steel tag and should last forever, even if the cat loses her collar, the tag will live on. :)  Although the Beastie Band collars have NEVER come off, and they are just held on with Velcro (and are stretchy so she was stuck, she could back out of it).

"This is one of the best pet-related purchases I have ever made.  When my extremely high drive agility papillon was sidelined with an injury and rehab involved up to six months crate rest, I was in despair.  My little guy was furious to be incarcerated and was climbing the walls.  I tried front-packs but they hurt my back and he hated being so restricted.  Finally I bought this stroller (aka the ""chariot"") so he could still go along on the conditioning hikes we do every day with my other dog.  He loves the thing; he likes to go with the top down (although I have a good hold on his leash).  In crowded areas or near streets we close the top.  The stroller is extremely high quality, very stable to push, and works on most terrain.  We hike across a golf course and on gravel and dirt roads with no problem.  It turns easily and has a parking brake.  It folds fairly quickly to chunk it in the car.  My only nitpick is the latch that secures the top is a bit hard to undo. Otherwise this design is absolutely perfect, and having this ""chariot"" is keeping us all sane during this loooong rehab.  Absolutely worth the expense.",1
"I love being able to let my two dogs come on the porch if the weather gets bad while I'm at work, so this product is perfect for me.  This is actually our second one because the first one, the rubber flap that closes the door ripped off from the two dogs using it so much.  They do sell a replacement flap, but it cost almost as much as the whole door cost, so we just replaced the whole thing. Besides, with it being a light color, it does get pretty grungy looking after a while.",1
Very good filter. Unfortunately won't fit the 20g marine life half moon talk lid.,1

I was standing right over the box and could NOT smell the feces or the urine deposits that my cat, Beatrice, left. She has no problem pooping it up but she always covers it. I scooped it as usual and I was shocked that it was definitely living up to the Double Duty name. I recommend it.",1

"Wow, such a premium price tag for what is clearly a bottom-of-the-barrel product!

Fancy Feast Gourmet products are stuffed full of corn and soy fillers, artificial flavors and artificial colors.  There isn't even a meat listed as the first ingredient and the primary protein source is ""Poulty By-Product Meal"", which is low-cost and low-quality and known to cause all sorts of digestive issues in pets in larger doses like this product offers.

The multiple reviewers giving this product 5 stars either work for the company that makes this Fancy Feast food or they simply don't understand what makes a cat food ""good""!

Just because your starving cats will eat it, doesn't mean it's good for them and a proper, high-quality dry food will not only extend their lives, but also reduce medical conditions as they age.  If the cost of buying even a mid-level food is a concern, believe me...in the end, you'll actually SAVE MONEY by feeding your pet a higher quality food!  Furthermore, there are SO MANY better foods available at this exact price point, it's a shame anyone uses Fancy Feast at all!

I have 3 cats of my own, all approaching their senior years, so I know how cost-prohibitive many of the specialty foods can be.  However, there are still some great commercial food options these days that won't break the bank, even for multi-cat households like mine!  Take a look at Taste of the Wild, Solid Gold, etc. for some good quality, reasonably affordable options that offer REAL nutrition.  Amazon has a great selection at delivered prices that often beat the local stores!

Ultimately, if you really care about your feline companion(s), you'll avoid this Fancy Feast ""Gourmet"" food and give them the food they really deserve!

Don't fall for the positive reviews here, this Fancy Feast is NOT a good food...for ANY animal!",0

"In preparation for our first puppy we bought a lot of things in advance, anticipating our little bundle of fur. This product was one of them. Following the recommendations of countless gurus we laid a bunch of these pads on the floor of our pups ""safe pen"" in the living room. Within 5 hours of getting home, and rubbing his face on these his left eye swelled completely shut and his right was on the way when we went to the urgent care vet near by. At the time we had no idea what had caused the reaction. Two hours, $180 dollars, a corneal dye check, and an antihistamine shot in the bum later we take him home. Where he is just fine until bed time when his eye starts to swell again, because he was running a fever we took up the pads to give him some nice cool hardwood to lay on hoping it would make him feel better. Swelling goes down... a day later we had one left in his crate he got a good face rubbing on and he had the same swelling reaction almost immediately. I have no idea what they put in these pads but I'm positive that it can't be good for a pup, especially not mine.",0

Love this for stuffing bits of fabric into it and watching my pup try to get them out! Great brain buster for the price and she hasn't destroyed it!,1
I don't know who loves this more... my dogs or 18 month old. Ha! My dogs tear any kind of soft toy to shreads within minutes... but refuse rubber toys. This thing is tough! Not even a single puncture hole from their teeth and my toddler LOVES to squeak it and get their attention. I will never buy another brand of dog toy again!,1
"Very flimsy, brittle plastic. Instructions aren't clear. Pictures are fuzzy at best. Makes a LOT of noise. I have three kitties that won't go near it let alone drink from it. Difficult to unassemble and reassemble. The sucking device has to fit perfectly over hole in pump. This is a blind manuever and for which there are no guide slots or markers. I have three kitties who won't go near it let alone drink from it. They really aren't finicky kitties. Rather adventurous. But not around this thing.",0
"I have an older cat with medical issues, and was hoping this would be the answer to two times a day liter scooping.

This shampoo made my dog break out with bumps all over his body and dry skin. Which is what usually happens to him when hes had an allergic reaction to something.

"The design is good - easy to open & clean as needed. My feral cat Rocky enters to eat his food, but he quickly exits as soon as he's done eating. It's getting cold now & he's just over a year old - a sturdy cat, but I'm so fearful he won't survive the winter. I put straw in it - he hated it & refused to go in. I removed the straw & put the pillow back in covered in a fleece doggy blanket - again he won't sleep in it. Catnip, toys, some dirt & leaves, and finally a warmed up towel - he still won't stay in it after he eats. If the manufacturer sees this review, can you please offer some tips to get my little Rocky to stay in your house. I've sectioned off his food dishes, so he has to go all the way in, but all of the enticements to sleep in it still aren't working.",1
"I want to start with saying that this product may work if the animal is chewing the furniture, but for scratching it's no good.

In addition to that every time someone touches the couch and after that touched his/her mouth the taste is horrible. It's been more than a week and this is still happening.",0

"This is amazing! We had a cookout at my house the other day and tried it out. My BIL said we were 3 years too late for it (because she's been yapping for 3 years!) It was so amazing to see it work. People were able to come in and out and there was no barking. She would growl slightly, but I can handle the growling. The collar itself only shocked her once and other than that it beeped to warn her and that was all she needed. The collar continued working after we had taken it off; meaning she continued not barking without it. I never thought anything would make my dog stop barking! I have tried the spray bark collars -- they would spray her just when she shook her head and I never felt that was fair to her.",1

"I love the design of this box, but it's not well executed. After only two months of use (one cat), I noticed that the upper tray no longer laid flat, but was at about a 45 degree angle. I took it apart and saw that the plastic ""socket"" that the handle fits into had stretched/bent greatly so the handle was not secure and could not return the tray to it's appropriate position.
I tried to fix it by gluing the handle in there with Gorilla Glue, which worked for a few weeks, but I noticed today that the upper tray again is no longer being restored to it's appropriate position.
So three months and $65 later, I'm finding myself in search of a new litter box. Very disappointing.
Also, I made sure not to overload the upper tray with litter. And the one cat that uses it is 10 lbs. So this is not an issue of there being too much weight in the tray causing the plastic to bend/warp.",0

"It does its job.  However, my Aquaclear 70 filter came with a set of filter media, including this sponge.  And since you can use something else, such as poly-fil straight from a craft isle, which is much cheaper (and quite possibly better), and/or you can simply gently rinse the foam in tank water during a water change to clear off solid gunk (in fact you want to; rinsing thoroughly gets rid of beneficial bacteria necessary for a healthy tank, and rinsing in tap water will kill the bacteria outright - trace chlorine is still deadly)

On the other hand, I did find it useful to cut off a chunk, make a slit, and cover my filter intake to keep any more of my little guys from getting sucked up :(  ...and it's always probably a good idea to have spares, just in case.  So, especially with shipping, i feel like i spent way more than i should have, but the product itself does what it's supposed to do, and then some.  Then again, so does a coat hanger.",0

It didn't last a month before the bottom fell out and the walls started to collapse! by the time I could get around to fixing it I couldn't even move it with out it tearing up even more.

overall a great little collar though, especially at the price.",1

"Either I was sent a filter which was missing parts or the person who designed it had NO IDEA what they were doing.

"Batteries came in a package that was already opened. Thinking it was just a problem with the glue on the packaging, I used them. The batteries only lasted 1-2 weeks!",0
"I have a three-year-old male, neutered cat who recently started having UTI issues.  One night about two weeks ago he began peeing outside his litter box in different areas of the house - little droplets at a time. He also licked himself a lot. He still went to his box, and frequently, but continued to pee elsewhere, squatting for long periods of time with little to show for it. From what I have gathered from the internet, this could mean he is associating his pain with the box.  Sometimes he would hide under the futon upon exiting the box. There was no blood in the urine that I could see, and other than when he needed to pee, his personality was the same as ever.  Regardless, there was clearly an issue since it continued into the next morning. So the next day, I brought him in to the vet clinic where he received two shots - one for pain and an antibiotic that was supposed to last him for two weeks.  He got the shots because he WAS still peeing, if only a little.  They weren't expensive either - maybe $40 per shot - which is pricey but not as pricey as the procedure would be for clearing out a total blockage. He immediately began to use his litter box again and all seemed fine.

Unfortunately, there was no mention of changing his diet from the vet - however, he was very stern that if our kitty was to stop peeing entirely, it meant there was a blockage and he would need to be brought back IMMEDIATELY.  We bought wet food at the suggestion of a friend, but didn't understand at the time how important it probably was so we stuck mostly with dry food since he does drink a lot of water. Almost a week later, the same exact symptoms started again.  I can only guess that the pain shot had worn off.

After some research, I discovered the Pro Plan formula and decided to give it a shot since it has great reviews (other than a few about cats not liking the taste). I got a whole case. He still has a week of antibiotics to go, but since starting him on this diet about 24 hours ago, we have had no accidents in the house.  He has also been peeing in greater amounts, just since yesterday - no more droplets after straining.  We've been scooping his litter often to keep track of how much he goes, but so far, so good!  This food only gets 4 stars because the cans are so tiny.  Our big boy is 14 lbs. I may stick to giving him a quarter cup of dry food (also Purina) mixed with a can of this food and additional water poured in for both meals, until I feel like his condition has cleared up. Then maybe will switch to a different wet food with bigger cans, using Pro Plan only occasionally.  I'm open to suggestions on portions and mixing food... he's not thrilled with the consistency of wet food, but does seem to like the taste.  I'm paranoid now about giving him dry food at all, but I don't want him to go hungry either.  He will eat it when it's mixed, and keep in mind I am still adding water to it. Hoping that will balance the dehydrating qualities of dry food.

Wow - long review... But I hope this helps someone if they're in a similar situation. I've never had an indoor cat before, let alone one with a serious issue like this and it's scary to deal with.  My husband and I are in our late 20s, no children yet, so we do care a lot about our little guy. I'm no expert, but from my experience with all this in the last couple weeks, all I can recommend is to get them started on wet food early and focus on hydration, particularly for boy cats since they are prone.  Obviously, take them to a vet if this doesn't seem to be enough. Ask about the shots if you go early enough into the symptoms, because catheterization sounds miserable for everyone involved and expensive.

Update (1 week later): The symptoms came back after a couple days.  Eventually there was blood in the urine every time he went - and he went a lot.  He was miserable and we were so scared for him.  Long story short, his ultrasound revealed that he had sediment floating around in his bladder.  Zero stones.  The vet did a laser treatment that we will have to bring him back for two more times, and he was also given an anti-inflammatory oral med. The miracle shot I mentioned before is preferably only given once because it can lead to liver damage or something. Anyway, the laser treatment takes only minutes and he began peeing clear and in greater amounts, immediately.

So in the end, the vet still recommended a wet food diet. He approved of the Purina Pro Plan because it makes them drink more water, I guess from the sodium content. There was also a prescription dry food but he said it would be way more expensive than just buying wet food. Again, it comes down to keeping them hydrated.  It could be that his symptoms came and went because he was flushing some of this sediment out of his system.  Bottom line - keep your kittens hydrated and maybe they'll never have an issue.  If they do, definitely see your vet. Also helps to bring in the label off of your food so they can approve it.

Currently, my boy is lying in his spot on the edge of the bed.  Shaved belly aside (from the ultrasound), he is tired but doing great.",1
"We'd been having trouble getting our greyhound to eat in the mornings.  At night, he was fine eating his presented kibble, but couldn't eat more than 2 cups at dinner, so he quickly started to lose weight from skipping breakfast.  He is exercised regularly, not given many treats, and is otherwise healthy; we concluded that he associated eating in the morning with me leaving, as he has recently been improving/able to cope with ongoing separation anxiety.  So, while he can now tolerate me being gone and can remain at home calmly and quietly without hurting himself or the house, it still would make him lose his appetite at the thought of me leaving since it was part of the routine.

We bought this food to give it a try and see if it would help him eat more and keep weight on and generally be happier.  Wet food (of the high quality stuff) didn't help too much because he could pick out the pieces around the kibble.  I wanted a mix that I could mix with his kibble that he'd adore.  Well, that's exactly what Grandma Lucy's is!  From day one, he's loved and looked forward to breakfast time.  At night, he still only gets kibble soaked in water, but eating at night was never an issue with him since I'm always around.  Grandma Lucy's is an excellent product.  I'll admit, it doesn't really look to appetizing to me, but there's no denying that my dog adores it.  As I mentioned, I don't use it as a sole diet; I mix 1/2 a cup (pre-water) with his kibble and it makes a mushy slop, but he gobbles up every last drop.  Even after having a fair amount of it, he had normal stool after the first day; this is not typical for him, as it normally takes his system a week or so (even with gradual food introductions) for him to not get stomach upset.

Grandma Lucy's is the best deal I've seen for dehydrated foods, especially if you buy 10lbs at once (I've seen it for $65 on here) which would make it a little over a dollar a pound. For the way I use the food, this works well for me.  Not sure what it does for their teeth, being so mushy, but I brush my dog's teeth daily so this was not a concern for me.  Great product; I'm sure your dog will love it!",1
"Excellent product for my dog's sensitive skin.  The meat version (lamb, bison, beef, etc) produces a rash but this one (seafood) works well.  Thavkfullt, he never gets tired of it.",1
"Both my dogs are absolutely crazy about these treats!  They're just the right size for my pomeranians; when they see me pull down the cannister I keep them in, they both start jumping around like crazy!  I can't keep enough of them in the house!  They love both the Sweet Potato and Peanut Butter treats.",1
It broke as soon as I was trying to put it on my cat. Snapped right in half. Not very happy about it.,0
"This shampoo has a great smell to it. Unfortunately after using this, both my dog and my hand broke out in blisters that itched like crazy. I talked to my vet and she confirmed that this irritation is being caused by the shampoo. If your dog has sensitive skin, I would suggest caution.

My dog is a Blue Heeler mix for those of you who are interested.",0
"Love it. I have all andis blades, and this cuts much better.",1
My Betta is thriving. This product works:),1
BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT!  NOT A QUALITY PRODUCT,0
Doesn't work in an extention cord has to be plugged into the wall directly.,0
My standard poodle and golden retriever love these as the have 3 nubs instead of 2.,1
"This did not work as a muzzle at all.  Our dog broke it open within a minute around another dog.  It's a great idea, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're actually looking for any sort of muzzle.",0
"I was not feeling great after replacing the carpet and painting my office. So to help eliminate odor from the new carpet and paint in my office I used this Bad Air Sponge combined with the Moso Natural Air Bag and within 10 days or so the office smelled better, and I was feeling much better.",1
This Boxiecat litter turns to mud/clay and becomes impossible to scoop out. I regretted buy buying this. I was very disappointed.,0
Dogs love it,1
This was suppose to be a 4 pack and I only received 3 filters,0
"Good Product.  Cat will eat it.  However, product expires next week - around 6 weeks after delivery.",0
I have a 48 pound dog and walking her this morning she chased a squirrel and upon hitting the stop button the device that stops the reel blew apart. Upon taking unit apart noticed that all pieces are made of cheap plastic and would never stop a 220 pound dog much less a 48 pound dog.,0
it sucked,0
My 6 month old kitten pulled the mouse completely off within 5 seconds. Not worth the money.,0
We use these steps in the living room on the sofa. They are the perfect height for that. They are too short for the bed,1
I ordered a beautiful orange one for my dog with writing on both sides. Just what we were looking for. Just be on the lookout for a letter-sized envelope. Could mistake it for junk mail if you're not careful.,1
Just fine. It arrived fast and is what my bird likes to eat,1
"It has helped my dog a lot.  He was having trouble jumping and going down/upstairs.  This product helped him almost immediately, and hes back to his youthful, playful, 16-year-old self!",1
"Best stuff ever to protect your doggies' paws. My doggies have no problem with me applying it and they don't lick it off. My doggies have poodly fur, which means iceballs between the tootsies. With Musher's Secret, no more ice balls! They romp around like it's summertime. Also great to protect their paws in the summer against scorching hot pavement. It does leave a little residue on the floor right after application but that clears up and cleans up really fast. It also lasts a long time. My doggies are ecstatic when they see me getting it out because it usually means a romp through the woods.",1
This product has given my 10 year old 103 lb. labrador more movement. He had difficulty getting up and now rises much more easily.,1
"Perfect size for my Slinky. He's a large miniature doxie, 18lbs 20-22 inches long. He has to stick his tail out the back sometimes but otherwise, he loves it!",1
These will not sink (not even with soaking) and they make me feel like I am feeding my fish air... :--/,0
"Dusty!  I've been using this litter for several months in a multi cat household with multiple boxes. When I first started using it, I would use a bright strong light next to the box being scooped so I could evaluate the dust level. I was so excited when I could clearly see that practically zero dust was coming from the scooping. And then sadly, like most things in life, the good thing came to an end. I started noticing more and more dust, just like the cheap clay litters. I dumped the boxes a few days ago to refill with my freshly delivered Dr Delseys. Dust storm. Dust flying everywhere, coated my black t shirt, coated flat surfaces near the littler boxes. I had to soldier on with it,  it was now filling my boxes and of course I was going to use it up. Scooping multiple boxes everyday now requires me to go back to wearing a mask, the dust is so prevalent.

I will use this batch up while I'm on the hunt for new litter that is, in fact, low or no dust. I would NOT recommend this litter if you're looking for a low or no dust solution. It started out that way but the company must have made a change in the formula fairly recently. Since this is advertised as 99% dust free, that strikes me as deceptive marketing.",0
This too has holes in a short amount of time. Not made very well,0
"I LOVE THESE NEW STEPS FOR MY OLD DOG.. IT TOOK HER TIME TO TRAIN HER ,BUT NOW SHE GOES UP & DOWN..SO GLAD FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE THINGS FOR YOUR PET!! A BIG THANK YOU!! WILL SHOP AGAIN..",1
This is much larger than what it indicates. Buy a size smaller than you need. Its a dissapointing size chart.,0
It said small but when I got it and it is med. Not make any sense.,0
"I would have written a rave review right after purchasing this because it is convenient as a wheelie bag - though the large size is laughable as a backpack (uncomfortable and unwieldy). But after about 6 months, it cracked at the bottom where the supports are with no viable means of repair. We didn't use it often, but apparently the streets of NYC are too much for this bag. Our dog only weighs 20 pounds and we bought the large bag, so... buyer beware.",0
"Easy to wash, so I love it.",1
After wearing only about a dozen times the velcro disintegrated. I made 2 attempts to contact the company with no reply. Save your money.,0
I have an 8 month old Border Collie/Aussie Shep mix who is WAY too smart for his own good. He figured this out pretty quickly but he loves it.,1
These did not Purina One cans by a slight margin.,0
Grabs the hair right off my German Shepard.,1
"For the self-cleaning aspect alone I give it 5 stars. I also love the comfortable rubbery handle, and the way it cleans loose hair.

My cat has long, fine, very soft hair, and really needs this brush at times, although ordinarily  I use a regular 2-sided brush with black plastic bristles on one side, and metal pinhead bristles on the other because the cat loves it. I use the Safari self-cleaning brush when she's shedding more. This brush can scratch the skin, so I have to be extra gentle when using it.

I also like th color of green. :-)",1
Did not last my dog.  He had it torn apart within minutes of me giving it to him.,0
"Wish I could give a review. Put this on my dog and stopped to talk to another person, he had the muzzle part chewed off in no time. It literally wasn't on long",0
Got the product and wasn't what had been explained it was super small. And not even close to being a large.,0
"I have a nervous cat, who pulls her hair out and gets clumps on her fur. She hid a lot and was very jumpy and nervous. I have used this before, when I was moving to keep all the cats calm. I decided to try it again recently, I have a brand new calm and happy, playful cat. I recommend this for all cat owners!",1
"This works fantastic! I could tell a big difference between my old dog shampoo & this one!  Really cuts through the thick layers of hair quickly as you work it in. Then I notice it turns into a creamy foam, which is great for my dog's very dry skin!
Also, I use to have to shampoo my dog twice to get him real clean but with this shampoo, one lathering gets it.

The only complaint I have & the reason for not giving it 5 stars is, I wish it had more deodorizing to it. Some people like a lot of scent & others don't. I'd like a fresh clean scent that would linger on my dog so not only does the dog look but smells clean. To each their own & for me I'd like a fresh scent, more than what it has.",1
Item accurate and delivered on time.,1
It was ok I ordered blue and I received pink,0
"Came quick and looks better than expected! I got this for my bulldog puppy who is named in honor of my vet grandfather and I must say, not only is it of great quality, but it's a great tribute AND so vibrant! Thank you!",1
Oh my W0W! My 110 pound dobe stands no chance of destruction. A first even with any other bone. My last dobe almost died from a bone so I was very unsure of giving my new dobe a bone....he cannot break of chunks and so far no chance of choking or swallowing chunks. A must for every agressive chewer.,1
Ordered 4 of these aquarium heaters for my beta fish about 5 months ago. Decided to do a water change today and found out my GFCI had tripped. After inspection I found one of the heater had a dark color inside the glass around the heating element. I'm not really happy at all. Now I'm worried about the other 3 heaters..Dont want any worse thing to happen to my fishes or house...Hopefully the seller can address to this situation..,0
cute,1
"Not for puppies, only for grown dogs that are already crate trained.  My puppy tore through the mesh in under an hour while we left her in the cage to run a quick errand.  Not made to keep an animal inside of it, just made for dogs that are looking for a cave to sleep in.

Size was good, as was the weight...just not functional for a puppy who wants to roam around a house.",0
On time and great product for fraction of the price,1
Doesnt last. Already in the trash. Dog chewed pieces right off. Occupied him for about a week or less.,0
Just too heavy for my little Scottish Terrier.  I was afraid that he would have problems with his neck as a result of wearing this heavy container of citronella around his neck.  Gave it to a friend who has a 55 lb. German Shepard.,0
"After waiting for months, I received it and it's missing the front strap to secure it. The straps are not quite long enough to go around the bucket seat. However, being the handy type person I can make a strap to hold the front up.",0
It was actually too small and I don't recall a size choice when I ordered.,0
Seems  to have worked well for our cat.,1
Great product.  This is my third attempt at getting something on my dog's feet so he stops tearing up my hardwood floors.  This one finally worked.  I have an Alaskan Malamute and the XL fits him well.  He was in between the L and XL.  He wears them well around the house.  I can briefly let him outside in them to go potty and not worry about them falling off as he goes down the steps.  Only bad thing is the Velcro was full of dog hair within a few days but his hair gets everyone anyway.,1
Didnt work,0
"Did not get rid of fleas. I bought local, and than it worked.",0
perfect for older outdoor dog to avoid wet mattress,1
"delivered on time, as described",1
"I ordered this dish due to the large volume of water it holds. I got tired of refilling my old fountain multiple times per day since I got a puppy. Now, I only need to refill about twice a week, though I also tend to clean it out whenever the reservoir needs filled (my dog leaves bits of stuff in the water a lot). My cats and dog all love the fountain and I have had no trouble with the loud humming others have complained about. The pump is actually quieter than the previous fountain I owned (only about 1 year old).",1
My 3 year old tabby is LOVING this little toy of his.  Bought an extra to share with my daughter who has 5 kitties.  Surely they'll love it just as much.  Very happy with purchase.  *smiles*,1
"We have three dogs.  Two that will eat almost anything.  One that is more picky.  The two are like a piece of cake.  It is all yummy!  Miss pick,  most of the time will eat her dinner with the salmon oil well. It not then I feed her out of a spoon.  Ends well.",1
"Too little and a cheap..i dissapointed,",0
Good.  Needs to be reapplied often.  Makes house smell like an herbal cough drop.  Really great to have a non- toxic alternative.,1
"Amazing! This brush works so well I now own 3! Best for animals with more of an under coat. Works great on my cats gets out so much hair, but for my dog that's a short hair it doesn't do quite as well, he still loves how it feels though!",1
"I'm taking this back.  It doesn't work.  Matter of fact our Hound Dogs ripped apart the pad we sprayed it on and further more I had sprayed it on a pad at 8:30pm when I went to check on them in their room at 9:30pm the pad was torn to shreds and they were wild and crazy.  There is something in it that makes them very wild.  I ended up having to give them dog rescue remedy to get them calmed down.  Never seen anything like it.  This product needs to be taken off the shelf.  Hound dogs have a great sense of smell and we are thinking that after spraying the pad accoriding to the directions that they could smell it even when prior to they were sleeping in their beds.  But once that pad was in there, they went crazy wild and ripped it to shreds...started barking...it was nuts.  NEVER AGAIN TAKE IT OFF THE SHELVES!",0
The 2 bells feel off. One during shipping,0
My 2 boy's will only eat PurinaOne,1
Sebastian my umbrella cockatoo loves this thing. I think it was instantly his favorite toy.,1
"Our dog loves this food - we use it for ""treats"" as well as mixing it in with chicken for meals. It is a perfect size for small breeds.",1
The litter falls out of the side when you turn it.,0
Only 1 collar works.  I will be returning this product. Other collar works great and does a good job.  I would have gave this product 5 stars if both remotes work.  I will be going with a different brand because I no longer trust the reliability.,0
"Great value,well made product,looks lovely",1
My cat likes this Earthborn Holistic Chicken Catcciatori Chicken Dinner in Gravy Wet Cat -- but price is for one 3oz can.,0
"First the harness was suppose to be a ""xx-small""...it was as big as a size small I had bought at PetSmart. So deff. not a XX-Small. Then the first time I hooked the leash to the harness I had tried on my daughters bigger yorkie...the metal hook broke right off. Do not waste your money on this poorly constructed item. Liz Parsons.",0
"It broke after one use. It says that it is for plane use, but the plastic inside broke from being put under the seat I guess, I just know that when we got to our destination, there were all these pieces of black plastic in with my dog. I think that is unhealthy as well.",0
"My cat has peed twice, once on a chest and once on the couch/ hardwood floor since I plugged these in.  He was doing it before, so maybe we just need to give it more time, but definitely not an instant fix.  I keep treating areas with Nature's Miracle.",0
"The black rubber strip came unglued from the blue bowl about 4 days (and 2 washes) after we got it. It's really cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"This product ought to be pulled from the shelves!!!!!!! It almost killed my cat, who, after a flea-free life, wound up with fleas this past summer, and I purchased this product to help address that problem. Yes, yes, I simultaneously treated the house, with a pump spray, using all the precautions stated on the container. After 4 emergency room (animal hospital) visits, patient spoon feeding with strained baby food, rehydration, and a myriad other life-saving and bank account-depleting interventions, I've since learned about other cats who met with a similar fate and worse. How can this product continue to be sold? Name recognition and affordability, I suppose, but every vet with whom I've spoken since say the same thing. Hartz be gone! Other products- Frontline, Advantage, and Virbac Knockout spray - remedied the flea problem, and my cat ultimately recovered. Flea growth inhibitors, not poison! A tough lesson learned. Wish I could give this product negative stars, but the program won't allow.",0
My dog loves these treats.,1
For some reason this made my dog sick.,0
"This collar was very poorly woven and very stretchy. I did not trust it to take my large dog for a walk or to go outside. I wanted to return it, but before I could, it fell off and she chewed it up. Very poor quality for the money.",0
"These heaters are incredible, they use a ton of electricity but get the job done! I have a 1200 gallon turtle pond in my garage and two of them keeps the water at 80 degrees in the winter no problem.",1
"Discouraged by a huge jump, in the price.  About $6 in a few months.  What's going on???",0
"We have a miniature pinscher who  inhales  her  food.  This ball was a life saver for us.  She happily rolls it around to dispense her meals.  We have replaced it twice,  She picks it up at the opening and the plastic splits there.  But, it stands up to the  dishwasher and 3X a day usage.  We find it well  worth while to replace every 3 or 4 years.",1
I was pretty happy with this food till the price went up close to $10 more. Wont be buying again.,0
"LOVED this - recent roadside work had broken my wire. I saw a few videos for this, and they really explained it well. The kit contains everything I needed, explained the steps well, and I located the break within minutes. I was feeling overwhelmed, but didn't want to pay $100 for someone from the company to come out!! The instructions plus the YouTube video had me feeling I could manage it, and I got it done ;-) Very happy w/ this kit!",1
"Fantastic, heavy duty. My dogs love it and it saves my back!",1
Great toy for Jack Russell terrors. It has been used and abused by my pup for the last few months. It has held up better than other toy. But then just about all Kong products are well thought out and made.,1
very nice product to carry food while on trips.,1
"After one month of wear by the cat, the collar is in terrible condition, all shredded, with some sort of webbing showing through. The once pretty blue outside is gone, but the bell is still there.  The bell is the best part of the thing, it stays on, but the collar looks awful.",0
Ok so I needed to replace my kitty tree with a less ratty one.  So like any normal person I purchased this tree late one night on Amazon. This one started having the carpet ripped in the first week. This is light weight and a piece of junk. Not worth the money. Within a few months the new cat tree looks worse than the 5 yr old one I just threw away. Save your money and steer clear of this item.,0
"The buckles end up at the armpits and rub too much, my dog hated this . . I do like the way that it hooks at the top at the leash",0
I like this because it has a guard on it so you can't trim down too far. I never wanted to trim my dogs nails before for fear I might hurt her or make her bleed. The guard also stabilizes the grip between my hand and her paw so its easier to clip the nails.,1
I would do 0 stars if I could. Bought this product no parts to put it together. Then if I decide to return and rebuy because its not complete.  Its more money than I originally paid for!! Im mean a lot more money!! What a joke!!,0
Not so tough. My 26 pound dog chewed the end off in no time,0
"If you're looking for feathers this is okay. If you want the tail toy, like my cat, you will be disappointed!!
The tail has a cheap plastic connector that breaks in a minute!!
I gave this toy two stars for the feathers only!! I did buy 3, yes three!! Because my cat loves the tail end of the toy.....the one that breaks  off in a minute!! ....But geeze, theres got to be a better way to get the end on.",0
"Too hard- my cats are not happy with them @ all- they are like shoe leather.  They loved the chicken treats, but these are not comparable.",0
Didn't work at all.,0
I appreciate these disposable angels! So far the water has remained crystal clear and my fishie friends seem to appreciate it as well! I have goldfish so I constantly had to clean out the 'reusable' filter bags but when that failed the water had to be changed constantly! (SO BAD) Now it's just a quick switch and done!,1
"Fed this time my cat who isn't a finicky eater. I regularly change her food with no issues, but from the moment I tried to feed this to her, she did not seemed interested. She nibbled at it a for the first 3 days, but by the 4th day she stopped eating entirely and I was forced to buy different food enitrely.

Going to try to donate my mostly full bag to the local animal shelter and hope they have some cats that might like this food.",0
i have two 12 lb. poms i give them 1 purina dental treat ever day for 5 yares and my vet thanks it is good for my pets,1
"So let me first state that my cats absolutely love this toy, they actually whine when I put it away and even as I am writing this she jumped up onto the counter and got it down on her own. My kitten loves to play tug of war with these types of toys and even though she isn't very strong she was able to pull the little cap and the string off the top. I was able to find the little cap so I am in the process of trying to use epoxy to glue it back on. All that being said I love the way the wand flexes and gives when the cats play with it. The cats seem to go crazy over the way the wand is able to make the toy move. The wand and string are both longer than others so it requires little effort to get the cats a good workout. The clasp is a very nice feature and I am able to change the toy very easily and the toy stays securely attached. The wand came with a variety of toys and my cats love them all and its nice that the company sells refills so you don't have to buy the wand over and over again. After all is said and done I would buy this toy again, and even though I hope my fix holds, if it doesnt I will probably continue buying it over and over again because my cats enjoy it so much.",1
My bird will not let me get this on him.  No way not happening in his world.  I wish there was a way to get the harness on easier.  The DVD instruction that came with it is useless to me because I don't have a DVD player in my computer and I don't have a DVD player for my TV...everything is online streaming.  I can't find any good tutorials online either.  I've seen a few online things where people show getting their bird in the harness but it shows birds that have already been trained and that just step into the harness.,0
Just got this harness for my little guy. I was very nervous because many things fir him weird. This harness fits perfect. Im so very happy with it.,1
My 40 pound rescue mutt slept in it the first nite we put it out for him.  He looks so comfy and cozy - it's just the right size.,1
"Neither of my dogs would take it. They both spit it out and they eat anything, so it must taste terrible.",0
Worked great until the plastic ring to connect to collar broke after 2 months.,0
"Lightweight, study and effective. Keeps my six cats a little neater.",1
My Dog Loves these!!!,1
Leaves red dye all over everything - including white or light colors dogs. Used 1 and am donating the rest to a shelter since they will not mind the red dye. It has now stained my new rug ,0
My dog loves these treats!!!,1
Not true to size,0
The handle is not strong enough to hold when the pan has litter in it.  I went to lift it and the handle came off.  Makes it difficult to move to clean.  Ogtherwise its a good litter box.  I have had smaller ones and they worked fine.  Handles definitely need to be stronger where they hook into the top.,0
I thought it was a little small when I first opened the package but it turns out it looks pretty good. I could have exchanged it for the next size but I guess it's too late now.  My dog is a 6lb Maltese.,1
"Watch what you order the lbs was only 3.5. Paid over $14, when the average cost is only $5. And can't send it back. Screwed out of $10.",0
"I was a little hesitant, because our local news station had done a ""Does it really work"" review on this product, and according to their ""test"" cats, they showed little interest in the Purrfect Arch, other than sniffing the cat nip for a short time.  But my cats LOVE being brushed, and I have a wall mounted cat brush that has most of it's plastic brushes worn off from being used so much, so I felt my cats would enjoy the Purrfect Arch.  I was right, and they do love it.  I have 3 cats, and they love playing on and around it, and they all take turns rubbing on it and against it as well as just playing with it.  So I am more than satisfied with this product, and maybe someone else out there will give it a try too, especially if their cats enjoy being brushed.",1
"Mine was dead too !  I just found it was too , small to complain .
It had 2 small curled up dead leaves.",0
Good stuff. My crazy German short hair does great on this. She climbs hills jumps down walls of 6  7 feet. Scary. She used to limps after her severe ADD runs.  She still has ADD I am convinced but the limps and aches are barely noticeable.  She has been on the product for a year or so.,1
I used this for my two large rabbits and they love it. I originally wanted to buy it because they got into the habit of kicking/digging their litter out everywhere. This was the perfect solution.,1
"Fluffy and Comfy!  My 13 year old Border Collie won't get off of it.  Luckily, it was for her and not her 2 other younger sisters!",1
"I've been feeding a local stray, and she has really appreciate this canned food! Whenever I decide to spoil her, I put a can outside and she gobbles it up.  I'm quite impressed with the ingredients and by the price.  I would recommend it to people whose kitties like seafood. :)",1
My puppy love this lamb and rice. This product helps my puppy sensitive stomach.,1
"This annoyed my beagle-jack russel mix so much he would rub his nose on the sidewalk trying to get it off. He scraped the skin off top of his nose before we realized what was happening, poor guy.",0
Only harness my cat will wear.,1
"Don't buy this.
It was fantastic at first but within a couple of months just became broken/stopped working as well. I cannot use it anymore.
I have bought many different clippers and nothing has ever stopped working like this before.
I wish I would've listened to the bad reviews.",0
My high energy little dog was scratching me by mistake too often.  I've had the caps on his front paws for about a week and he doesn't seem to notice them and I've had no scratches.,1
Very bad toy because it does choke dogs because of the material.,0
"Just okay, the dog likes Dream Bone better.",0
"update , unit is crap  as others have shown the unit just brakes free from the collar .I had to tape it one , the batteries only last a week or two , and my dog has learned that when the battery is dead the unit doesn't work , so he walks right past the sensor and onto the couch .",0
GREAT PRODUCT,1
nozzle does not work. wasted time spraying water twice. other brands work.,0
"My dog loves it, mostly when it was cold.  Now it gets to hit for him. But for his size works great and not overly heavy for me.  And size for the money I am happy",1
"We have 2 beagles and they both wear these collars.  We've been using them for about 3 months and so far no issues.  The battery seems to last a long time - we keep the collars turned-on all the time (even when the dogs are not wearing them), and charge them maybe once a week if we remember.  The beep to warn the dog of the fenceline is audible and after one enocounter with the shock from the fence, both of them listen to the warning tone and stay within the fence line.  We did have to use the larger prongs (included) even though are dogs are short-haired.  Overall, we have no issues and would highly recommend this collar.",1
"My dog does not like this carrier and I am not too thrilled because she keeps slipping down and it looks like she is strangling, poor baby.",0
says 7.48 oz. is 1.97 oz. waiting for contact to get my money back... feeling ripped off,0
Strong toy. Bought for my coonhound that loves to chew everything. I put peanut butter and dog food inside and she loved it!,1
Much more importantly.... Luke Loves It!,1
First time trying this product and it left a white residue and terrible smell on both my dogs. Will not use again.,0
The ingredients changed. Not a good food anymore.,0
"Excellent bowl.  Sturdy, stable, of clearly quality materials.  I like that the sides are less sloped as this seems to help my dog eat. Item received on time and as described. Fit 3 cups of large kibble with room for at least another cup. Very easy to clean.",1
"Terrible product.  First one lasted about 1000 hours, second one lasted less than 100.  Won't buy again.",0
It did not work at all,0
"Fell apart in five minutes. We thought the cross knots would make this toy last longer than most plush toys, but our Catahoula puppy destroyed it the second we set it down.",0
My dog hates this brush!,0
The rubber comes off after a couple days. Not that well made.,0
"FYI the guarantee is only for 30 days. If it's a few days longer before you decide to try to get it replaced, you are out of luck. I found this out the hard way. This toy did not last any longer than a cheaper toy would have lasted. I'm simply not impressed. My pup is a cocker spaniel and has several other toys that have lasted longer than this did. I don't recommend it.",0
"My cat is now afraid of it.  It fell completely over when he was trying to get to the top part, now he won't go anywhere near it.",0
didn't work with my dog at all,0
"Compared to the ones that I've used in the past, I thought these were made poorly. The quality of structure itself felt cheap (the plastic is flimsy) and you can only use it a few times before you have to throw it out. I have a Maltese and I was only able to use the small end 4-5 times until the bristles were ruined. My dog didn't even chew on them. I wouldn't recommend these at all. To compare, I've used the standard ones I've purchase from the CET brand - the brushes that come with the toothpaste itself which lasted much longer and felt a bit more sturdy.",0
"The light produced by this fixture is highly focused on a strip approximately 8 inches wide (I bought the 36 inch).  If you look at the back of the box, it actually says as much on its light distribution chart (which you can't really find anywhere online with any sort of ease).  It essentially made the area directly under the light extremely bright, but then left the areas of my 40G breeder relatively dim, especially towards the front.  It's actually a fairly neat effect (if that's your thing), if not for the fact that I wanted to grow plants with this light.  You'd have plants that got very large amounts of light in the middle, and then plants that didn't get much light at all on the front and back.

Also, my blue lights were finicky and would randomly decide they didn't want to turn on, or would just simply shut off.  It's likely my unit was defective in this regard.

I'd recommend looking at the finnex planted plus or the current-usa satellite (freshwater) plus lights instead if you want your whole aquarium illuminated.  I ended up going with the current-usa since they happened to be on sale from amazon at the time of buying.",0
"Love the gate overall, easy to install and everything, but my cats, puppy and 1 and a half year old can all fit through the cat gate so I won't be able to use that part of it for a while while I wait for my son and puppy to grow up a bit! Other than that, no complaints

Edit: I don't recommend for use with kids! My 1 and a half year old can climb it now thanks to the cat gate AND he and the dog can still fit through the cat opening as well :( I really wish we'd have gone with the gate without the cat door.",0
"Much bigger than I thought and what everyone put out to be, my dogs are scared to death of it, literally they will not eat or drink from it's size and they would thirst and starve to death before going around this thing.

Update: After it sitting on the shelf for a few months I decided to try this again and my dogs still didn't know what to come of this large thing trapping their food and water. After about a week of being scared to death standing wayyyy back stretching out their necks as far as possible to eat and drink they are now finally ok with it.",1
The engraving isn't deep enough and will wear off after a few months. I know this because I was given these as a gift and thought maybe I got a defective product and the new tags I just purchase are already wearing off like the old tags. You'd be better off going to your local pet store and getting them engraved there. If you want them to wear off and possibly run the risk of your pet getting lost and not being found then these are the tags for you.,0
"what an amazing product. My golden had always problems with his ears, not anymore!",1
Works great!,1
I really like this product because my cats love to eat it and it helps to clear up any signs of a cold quickly.,1
Not very effective,0
Also given as a funny Yankee Swap Christmas gift. Good quality product and I'm sure they will get used!,1
Thank you,1
"I use this all the time for my young pups, wouldn't be without it.",1
Did nothing! I kind of feel silly thinking I bought a rock to put in my dog's water bowl to help my lawn. Kind of like of you believe that I have a bridge to sell you! We are just going to have to take time and train our dog to pee in a designed area. That's really the only solution.,0
This dog bed lives up to its name! I have purchased many dog beds in the past and my 45 pound German shepherd would always rip them apart. I've had Slumber Pet Nylon Toughstructable Dog Bed for about a month now with not a single scratch on it! I'm very happy with this product.,1
My dogs loved it! Pretty sturdy too!!!,1
Great litter box. Easy to scoop.  Don't have to take the lid off. Large enough for more than one cat to share.,1
"Have always used LitterMaid boxes in the past for our four cats.  Now that LitterMaid does not offer the higher end box with the metal rake thought we would give something else a try.

None of our cats cared for this box.  Did not allow for enough litter for them to dig in.  Did not fully scoop the entire box.  Ultimately broke within the first two months.

VERY disappointing.",0
"My dogs love this, and it is easy to clean.",1
It arrived so fast and it is sooo cute.  We use it to take my cat to the vet.,1
"I have always had at least one dog and have NEVER had a dog like their dry food like my current dog likes TOTW.  I wish I had discovered it sooner.  My dog's coat is gorgeous and she lean with great muscle development, all of which I attribute to her diet.  I'm sending a bag to my brother's dog as a present.",1
Love this. Lights up area very well. I will buy again.,1
My dog is OBSESSED with this thing! I don't even put treats in it. I actually just feed him a little less for breakfast and when I head out to work I put the rest inside and it keeps him busy for a long time =) He sometimes carries it around with him even when there is nothing inside. My mom has one for her dogs too and they seem to enjoy it as well.,1
My cat loves her new bed.  Comes out only to eat.,1
Thank you,1
My 2 guinea pigs love this food. I have tried other food but they wouldn't touch it. My guinea pigs are more than pets to our family so we want the best for them. Thanks,1
"I never received it! Waited forever for USPS, contacted them, they were unable to trace even with the number, contacted Amazon, said they would refund, got partial but $20 gift card still among the missing. LONG time before I use them again!",0
Can't beat the quality or quantity for the price! I store them in a 5gal bucket to keep the moisture out and now my flock comes running whenever they see anyone carrying a 5gal bucket around!,1
I have a 9 year old 100 pound dog. He had a bad elbow and limps if I do not give him this. This brand is the best I have found the ingredients really work! If I didn't have this my dog probably wouldn't be able to walk. I would give it 100 stars if I could! You have to give it w few weeks to start working but then you will notice a difference.,1
Will buy more.,1
The cat loves it!  I put it in front of a window and she's on it all the time.,1
"My cat had outgrown her other tunnel.  this is much bigger and has more peep holes.  I just wish the crackly noise was all the way through, rather than just at the ends.  She loves the crackle noises.",1
"At first this ran well, but then after about 12 hours of use it seized up. I only used this for pure, clean water. I can get it to run again by ""smacking"" it around.",0
It fits beautifully and is comfortable for my dog.,1
I own a boarding and training facility.  I have tried other products for both my inside and outside agility field to reduce odor the other dogs pick up.  Absolutely NO OTHER product does the job like AIP.  I really like the auto order and the ability to dilute the spray for large applications.,1
"Had a neighbor's not neutered cat wandering our yard and that Ok with me, But NOT with my kitties. Started marking inside when they come in for the night. Used as directed, smell kept coming back & my cats are neutered. I found strong vinegar & water solution did the trick and way cheaper, folks!",0
"My dog, Chubbs, absolutely loves all three flavors of Benebone! They are the only bones/toys that he doesn't ever seem to get tired of chewing. My wife and I love them because he can pick them up off the floor without scratching up the hardwood!",1
"I bought this for my cat to fly in a plane when me moved cross-country. It was great. I had no problems getting through security with it, and it fit great under the seat. My cat was as comfortable as he could be (he was pretty scared on the whole trip).",1
Pup tried it and got sick the following day.  No good,0
Pup loves it. Sleeps in it all day.,1
Roudybush has been with out birds for almost 30 years .. a African grey and green cheek love this .. we have 2 moluccan Cockatoo and a b&g macaw that all look perfect .. no fat birds or feather issues ..I have total faith in roudybush .,1
I nought these live plants for a gift for my mom's aquarium. There were absolutely nowhere close to 40 plants. There were 7! They were really dirty and packed in wet paper. She tried to wash the dirt off but couldn't get it all so she wasn't putting them in her aquarium. She put them in a vase of water and they died the next day. Total was of $30. 40 plants? Ha! There were 6 scrawny limbs of the same plant.,0
"Nice bowls, I expected bigger ones but the dimensions were in the description so I guess I shouldn't have!",1
Bearded dragon wouldnt eat it,0
"I bought this to use in my fiddler crab's tank. It was great when it was working. My only complaint was when the power would go out or when I would unplug it and plug it back in, many times it just wouldn't work. You could hear it was getting power but it just wouldn't work sometimes. I had to adjust the filter many times and unplug and plug it back in to get it to work. Pretty much it worked when it wanted to. For the most part it stayed on all the time and I didn't have problems. It was only when the power went out, sometimes and when I had to move the tank for some reason. Otherwise I would say its a good buy for the price.",1
"This is worthless. I got two and one of the hinges broke off in the first 3 weeks, they sent a replacement, now (2 months from the original purchase) all the hinges from all 3 cat doors broke in the same place. Now i have a gaping hole in my wall while i try to find a same size replacement. Save effort, buy something else.",0
Product was as advertised.  Very high quality.  Product arrived in less time than anticipated.  My dog Buddy looks very sharp wearing this collar.  I would highly recomend company and product to anyone seeking a high quality leather studded dog collar.,1
Amazing product my puppy got into something and had a real badinfection on jis nose and he kept scratching at it and i bought this and sorayed it on his his nose and he didn't scratch any longer and it healed up... great will buy again...,1
"The bowl totally works on slowing our speed eater down. What took her 20 seconds, now takes her 5 minutes. Only thing I wish was the no slip grips were made better and actually attached to the bowl. They arrived half stuck on to a sticker sheet.",1
"So, it's not even worth a wordy review.  Suffice it to say, this product is basically a Plug-It-In, a pricey one that does nothing except make you feel like you did something to help your pets.  It's a feel-good purchase that's laughably a piece of junk, and you know it the second you open the box.",0
"I've been ordering these treats for my dogs for a few years now - they really liked them. The cookies were not only adorable, but apparently pretty tasty. Recently, though, the last few boxes I've bought have contained nothing but broken remnants of the advertised shapes of cookies that don't even have the cute outlines on them that originally distinguished them from each other. Additionally, the cookies look overcooked and are very hard. Plus - they no longer have that fresh baked smell to them. I really am disappointed in the quality control from Blue Dog Bakery. For the amount of money I spend on these, I expect consistency to the quality. I guess I need to find another low fat treat alternative for my furry family members.",1
"I got the large version of this toy (not listed here) for my Alaskan Malamute. He loves plushie toys and for the most part, they last awhile (a month or so). This guy was bigger than my dog's head and my dog had is DESTROYED in a half hour flat. It was definitely a very expensive half-hour toy....",0
"They are doing the job as intended.  The fabric combinations are horrific, but if your dog doesn't mind...
I ordered the XS and the huge piece of Velcro was overkill and very stiff.  Consider spending more on matching fabrics and less on Velcro.",1
"Package arrived on time and in great condition.  Set up was easy and the betta is definitely much happier in here than in his .5 gallon starter tank.  The light is a nice bonus and instead of batteries, we used an old wireless earphone charger to plug it into the wall.",1
"I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.",0
when it arrived it was missing the middle piece that connects the two ends together. it was too much hassle to repackage and ship back so i just kept the pieces and will use a different wand,0
Dragon doesn't like it,0
"Pretty hard to get the glue applicator to work right let alone tell how much glue is actually getting in the cap. I gave this an extra star just in case I got a size too small and/or my glueing skills were bad. But these didn't even stay on a day. As difficult as it is to restrain a cat and deal with the super glue, I cannot recommend caps in general. I may try a medium size, but it will probably be a waste of money and effort.",0
"If you are looking for a temporary scooper, this is the product for you. It lasted about a month before the spring wore thru the center bar. The problem is that the spring is metal and the bar holding the springs is plastic. It's just a matter of time before the springs wear thru the plastic bar.",0
"I really wish that I could say 100% that this stuff works.  We adopted a  4 year old shelter cat.  She was having pee accidents on random SOFT things.  But at the same time she was going in the box 92% of the time.  So we did get cat attract.  As far as we know there have not been any suspicious accidents since.  With our cat we can not leave soft things on the floor, pillows ect.  She is attracted to soft things and will pee on them.  So while this product seems to work I can't 100% say for sure. I would not give a bad review because we have a STRANGE kitty.  HA.  I would say try it because we have a ton of friends whom utilize this and swear by it.  For us the biggest thing was trying to figure out her behavior, and of course the age old..take her to the VET to r/o any problems.",1
Bought this several months ago and neither cat has ever used it.,0
Great size treats. My dogs love them.,1
"fast ship, nice product!",1
"Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.

And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.",1
The pump is insanely loud.  It is awful.,0
"Memory foam seems pretty nice and the waterproof cover so far has held up, but the outer soft cover is not a soft or thick as I had hoped, it also seems to tare very easily, and is pulling apart at the seam in a couple places. I have only had it for approximately 5months. And I keep my dogs nails trimmed regularly.",0
This collar sprayed my poor dog with every movement he made. I would recommend against buying it. Amazon will not allow it to be returned.,0
"The heater is awesome. I use this heater to control the temperature for my turtles. It's easy for Red Ear Slider Turtles to get sick, so this heater is perfect for increasing water temperature to regulate their body temperature.

With the plastic exterior, your pets can never get burnt from this heater. If you have a Rena filter, combined you can connect with this heater and warm up the water through the hollowed center. For $20, this heater is a steal.",1
"I purchased this by accident at my local pet store.  It is absolutely awful.  The smell and the dust stay on your clothes and hands, and affected my breathing. The clumps fall apart when you try to scoop out the litter box.  All wet material adheres to the bottom and has to be scraped out.  I will never mistake this blue box with my tried and true Ever Clean (also in a blue box, and purchased through Amazon).  Stay far away from this stuff.",0
Our cats are quite tall and these litter boxes are perfect for them. Big entrance and the corner shape gives them a lot of room without taking up a lot more space than the old rectangular ones we had. I am very happy with the purchase and so seem my fur babies. They climbed in the moment I had set them up. :),1
"product worked 1st time, after that Not at all.",0
Didn't work at all. The off brand was more effective.,0
"When I got my first new car, a Honda Fit, I wanted to protect the seats. My darling little doggies who, besides all the other things dogs do, tend to dig furiously at car seats, especially when left in the car- even for a short time.  I went through several sets of the seat covers you can get at Walmart or car part stores.  These seat covers look like they are going to hold up better.  No horrible design like skulls or pink kitties.  Are suitable for use with side air bags housed in the seat back.  Good price.",1
My dog craves these things. He is very happy :),1
"I think the dog would give a better review than I could, but I'll try.  I got this for my dog when he was a puppy (lab mutt), and the holes let him grab it even though it was way too big to fit in his mouth.  I was a little worried that his puppy teeth might break if we played rough, but that's something you've just got to be careful about.

One thing you probably can't tell from the product description is that this is what I'd call ""medium hard"" rubber.  If you throw it on the ground, it collapses a bit so it doesn't bounce very high.  You can pretty easily collapse it with your hands.  I don't mean to say this is a con by any means, it's just something to know.",1
"Works great with:

Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter
Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box

Simple, easy, fast and effective.  I would like it to be a little easier to clean, just pay attention to the end of roll markings on the bags and do not let it run out. Otherwise this is a great product and well worth it.",1
Fits great on my Frenchie,1
"I was so excited to purchase this product and find out what my tuxedo border collie rescue was mixed with.  In the instructions it did ask if you knew what breed your dog was, but I wanted to find out if the results were going to be correct without any prior knowledge so I purposefully did not include that I knew she was a BC. My vet and I have speculated for years that she is a BC/Cocker Spaniel cross.  Imagine my surprise when her panel came back without any trace of BC whatsoever.  The only reason I am giving this product a star at all is that it did come back with evidence of Cocker Spaniel. All the rest however is nonsense.  American Staffordshire Terrier?  Bassett Hound?  Jindo?  Golden Retriever?  I don't think so.  It was fun waiting for the results but in the end, an epic fail as I feel utterly disappointed.  Perhaps they can work on improving this test, but for now I will just enjoy my little BC mix and continue to wonder.",0
It fell in my birds cage and wet everything time and again.,0
The dogs love it.  That's all that matters.,1
Purchased the Throwing X for our mini golden doodle and he ripped it open within 5 minutes. I wouldn't recommend for any dog who likes to chew.,0
"It seemed to work for a couple  days on my little poodle that barks nonstop, but after a couple  days he barked over it and is still  barking.",0
"I had my Labrador Retriever tested for allergies, since she was always scratching and her digestion was all over the map.  The tests showed she has severe allergies to a laundry list of foods.  I had her on a raw diet, but switched her to Natural Balance because the raw bones were starting to wear her molars down to practically nothing.  She's had no more itching and her digestion is completely better.  Amazon has the lowest price for this food.",1
They didn't last long only 4 pieces for the price you,0
"My dog loves these toys so much I had to get 2. Last time they sent me 1 red and 1 blue so that was cool. It doesn't take very long for both the tennis and squeaky balls to get removed. So I wouldn't really leave these for an unattended dog. However my dog seems to have so much fun destroying these things I keep buying them lol. She gets so excited when I bring one out its crazy, so I keep supporting her love of wubba habit!

Plus there good for playing fetch and tug of war, even after the balls are gone. I also sometimes will put a treat where the balls were and twist and tie with a hair tie or piece of rope dog seems to have fun with that too",1
Dogs don't like it.,0
dont work well at all,0
Ringo is going into his second week of taking Extend and we are seeing a difference in his overall mobility. I am hoping he will continue to improve as time goes on. By the way he loves the taste of it.,1
"Works well, can hold a lot of dog food.",1
Purchased for a domestic house cat and used every day for two years.  The cat's gums are full of hard plaque on the back teeth.  It does not work for cats at all and I believe the company should issue me a refund for its false claims.,0
"WAY TOO EXPENSIVE and SO SMALL!! My English mastiff had this thing gone in about 4 bites (keep in mind she eats cat crap also), so I am not saying that she ate it because it was overly delicious to her, it was just so small and a $10 price tag on something that is so tiny is ridiculous. I could grill her up a steak for that or buy a few chicken breast for her to eat. She would get more and be equally as healthy and actually be full after. I understand that this is a treat, so I feel it should have the price of a treat attached. $10 for a treat, is way too much. When was the last time you had a single served treat for $10? I understand the treat ""grows"" in size, the smaller the dog you are giving it too. I received this product at a  discount (which was still too expensive for this tine treat) in exchange for my fair and honest review.",0
"I used this when I used to be a vet tech back in the day, and I still use it now.  Yes it's THAT good, and I like the smell it leaves my pooches ears.",1
Great little light! I have this on my planted 10 gallon.,1
"Surprisingly simple, bright and effective. Easy to cut to size, and easy to see your dog at night.",1
"Good price and nice spacious cage for our dwarf hamster.
All the other cages I found were so small. Color is noce too.",1
This does not work at all. I had really high hopes for this device but my dog does not even hear it. I have tried clicking it when he is not paying attention to see if he was ignoring it or was not hearing it at all. He had no reaction whatsoever so I think he doesn't hear anything.,0
My cats love this!!! Awesome product and shipping was super fast!!!,1
"This my cats' favorite food! This is a very good deal, and the shipping price isn't bad considering how much this weighs. My only problem is that I run out too fast, because my cats love it so much!",1
I'm so pleased with the tag I ordered. I'm pleasantly surprised that it's smaller than I thought as I can't stand big dog tags. All of my info is correct and neatly engraved. I may have to replace my other dogs tag now!! I attached a photo so that you can see the size of the tag,1
"WORKS. With daily use. It works. Enzyme balances Ph in mouth and tarter disappears. We got an 8 yr old bichon with briwn tartar  bulid up, LEBA III worked. Now we continue use to maintain her teeth.
I care for dogs and many of them use this product. Nothing else works like it.",1
"IMHO this is by far the best food for my active 20 month old German Shepherd Dog. I've tried them all including Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Organix, etc and he looks and acts better with this stuff. I fed my last dog a raw diet which was great but a lot of work for me. Nature's Variety Instinct is giving me the same results as raw at less cost and less work, two thumbs up for Instinct!",1
"At first this was a great clipper - quiet, cordless, smooth - but then first one, then a few weeks later the other battery went.  They would appear to charge completely but then die in middle of the clip. Disappointing.",0
"These were a terrible product for my dog.  They caused her an upset stomach on the three separate occasions that they were given to her.  This last time she was so sick that she had a seizure.  The rest of the pack is going straight in the trash.

I was hoping for a chew that would last a long time, but with a heavy chewer these were gone in under 5 minutes.",0
It absorbs really well!,1
"Veterinarian's Best Feline Urinary Support Tables are the only tablets our Manx will eat.  He won't eat much until he has had his tablet ""treats"".  With the price of special products, we couldn't afford to try too many products.  Our boy seems to know how to make us all happy!  Thanks",1
smell awful. pig won't eat them,0
Does not hold up as promised,0
"Pay the extra money for the python! Bought this product a couple of weeks ago to ease my water changes, it does the job but it broke after first use. It still works just for the fact that every time I use it I have to place a small towel over the faucet connector to stop it from spraying water all over my countertop. It is made with very cheap plastic does not last very much I would not recommend this to anyone. Im sure the Python will not give the same problem.",0
Love these have ordered more than one,1
This leash has been great.  Really makes walking and running with my dog much better.,1
Its a nice automatic fish food tank feeder where you can set different times for it.  But the container isn't big enough for larger pellets.  Only for small and medium size pellets.,1
Works as stated.,1
"My dog obsessed with mint. He eats chewed up him off the street, has consumed an entire pack of gum, eats toothpaste, eats mint-scented cleansing wipes. Bought this for him and he sniffed it once and ignored it. This does not smell like mint at all. Furthermore I and another human chewed it to confirm it tastes how it smells: like rubber.
What a waste. Not for mint-living dogs.",0
"Update: the bolts are already falling out and the thing feels like it's going to collapse at any moment if you huff and puff on it with any gusto. For a great concept, this is VERY POORLY MADE.

The box is a dark espresso brown and the ""wood"" is better quality than I expected. It did come with minor scratches that seemed to be scratches before the finish was applied. But they are hardly noticeable. It is small enough to fit in my NYC apartment kitchen and doesn't smell up the whole place.

The thing itself, however, is incredibly flimsy construction!

The holes are drilled too wide, so the bolts do not stay tight. They unscrew right away and so the whole thing feels like it's about to fall apart if you rattle the side just a little. The cat uses it and it's fine: but I wouldn't start moving it from place to place. I picked a spot for it and am afraid to move it from there! If need to be moved, grab from the top: that part is sturdier than any of the flimsy sides.

It's a pretty hideaway for a litterbox, but worth 70$ max. Definitely not 100$.",0
They didn't work at all and I had to throw them away because my cats tore them apart. Waste of money for me.,0
SUPER small. If you have a dog larger than 35 lbs I highly doubt they'll fit the largest size. I used the size chart and they were way off. So disappointed with the purchase. These shoes are meant for toy dogs not medium to large breed.,0
This really seems to help my crazy Goldendoodle. It does not solve all his hyperness or seperation issues but it does cut them in half. We use these on both our Boston & Goldendoodle and it helps them a lot.,1
Excellent product. I add it to the chickens feed and the doggies too!,1
Got a second  dog and am now buying huge bags of food.  Bag fits in perfectly and I have this tucked away in the mudroom.  Good value also.,1
"This cat tree had a number of issues...
1) Got 3 different kinds of hardware, NONE Of them worked.  Called the manufacturer and got 2 new bolts no charge, but they were no nuts included.  Had to call again and get all new hardware for the entire thing.  So finally 3 weeks later got it all put together...

2) This will ONLY work on a door that opens in, it hits into the wall if it opens towards you.

3) No matter how tight I get the screws it still moves around and cats are scared as hell to get on it.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",0
Our dogs love this food.  It's cheaper than buying it at the pet store and lugging it home...that's a plus!,1
Did not minimize or eliminate urine odor. The crystals are large and painful to step on. MiMi Cat Crystals are much better at eliminating urine odor.,0
my dog will play with it for an hour,1
"This is not a dog whistle.  It is an audible whistle - kind of like a british police whistle (with the same sound) - that is pitch adjustable by screwing in (or out) the top threaded part.

I am not going to return it (less than $2) because we can use it for other purposes.  But THIS IS NOT A DOG WHISTLE.",0
"I thought after reading the reviews that this was going to answer our problem to leaking water bottles for my daughters hamster but it didn't. We found that it still leaks all over the bedding. Such a disappointment. The bedding directly under the bedding is soaked every time she fills it. It doesn't matter whether it's filled completely full or not, it still leaks. I will say her hamster loves to hang out underneath it though.",0
"It took a bit for Ollie to relax, but when he did, he was calm and smiling.  Some days he still has anxiety while wearing the shirt, but most days, he is relaxed and comfortable",1
Purchasing a second one. The only dog crate bowl that my puppy can't knock off the crate wall.,1
I got first one was dried and broken small pieces. I got replacement but it was the same piece of junk. I have to send back for the replacement one to get another one. But I don't want to get piece of junk anymore. My dog loves this product but not this one.,0
"These are fairly weighty barbells that my dogs enjoy quite a bit. For reference they are a young American Bulldog and German Shepherd mix. They are very good at destroying anything stuffed (and flinging stuffing everywhere) and lesser plastic toys. These do the job and have been fairly durable thus far, though I expect to eventually find shredded rubber. Still, not a bad purchase for the avid chewer.",1
Doesn't fit even though it said it should,0
My dogs favorite toys..,1
My felines are CRAZY about these! Have put this on auto order!,1
had a petrainer for older dog worked well glad we ordered new petrainer puppy she doing great !!,1
"The bowls are at least medium in size, if not large. It's clearly listed as small. I use it for my 14 lb. dog, instead of my chihuahua, but it's actually much bigger than needed for her as well. I would have returned it if I knew how to deal with shipping costs, where to send it, etc.",0
"I love the fact that this shampoo is organic. I have a white COTON DE TULEAR - a non shedding breed, but...
PROS: it whitened out all yellowish stains around her mouth
  It smells great
CONS: she started scratching and shedding really bad
I would return the item since it did not work out for us, but I already used it once, so I doubt the return would be accepted.
However, I do not discourage others from trying it out for themselves.",0
"I purchased two collars for my two dogs. One never seemed to go off when my dog barked (and he has a BIG bark) -- even when I had the sensitivity turned up. The other went off ALL the time (with the sensitivity turned all the way down). It went off when the dog ran, drank from her water bowl, scratched herself, it went off after I removed it from the dog and was placing it back in its box, and THEN it even went off when I sneezed from across the room. There was no rhyme or reason, and I felt horrible that it started shocking her for doing normal doggie things. A lot of reviews seem very positive about this product... so perhaps I just got two duds.",0
It seems that the product didn't work for my 2 german shepherd and shih -tzu. They get all white after the product dries and they scratch themselves a lot. My shih -tzu lost clumps of fur. So I really lost my money. I bought 3 boxes containing 6 ampules. I' M very disappointing! Niver buy that product again.,0
"Piece of junk. I order from amazon on a weekly basis, for years I have bought 100's of items and never wrote a review until now.
I bought this item exactly 1 month, and 1 day ago, just past the return period, and today it broke, I take care of things I buy, and I can't say whether it's an engineering design flaw, but the product didn't last.
I wouldn't buy another one, because I'm sure it would break as well.",0

"I bought this for my 10 gallon tank.

First of all, the manual is in Chinese, so you know off the bat  this isn't going to end well.

There's a sticker under the light saying DO NOT IMMERSE,

Yet the metal placement things that slide fall OFF, no safeguard. And being that this piece of cheap intrinsically , the full expanded measurement barely fits the tank size of that max width.

I think this company is intentionally selling hazardous products because this light fully immersed itself when I left the room and it fried my colony of 24 cherry shrimp in a quarter of a second.

Just beware go by a real deal light.

"Fountain is hard to clean and the scum build-up seems to have eroded the plastic, creating an uneven surface which makes cleaning even more challenging.  I bought the fountain because I was under the impression moving water would be cleaner than stagnant water.  This is not the case at all with this fountain.  In fact, debris lands in the water and will continue to float about until I clean the fountain again.  Some cats may drink from the top where the water flows out, but this was not always the case with my cat, so she may have been lapping up water right next to a drowned fruit fly.  The pump stopped working a little less than a year after purchase.  Lately, I am using a regular ceramic bowl that I rinse or wash once a day.  It's easier to maintain and very surprisingly much cleaner.",0
Good.,1
"We buy Frontline all the time for our animals. This time it did not work at all and now they all have fleas! We treat our yard along with our pets and have never had a flea problem until now. I have read several reviews on several sites and it is pretty much all the same, this stuff is not working this year! What a waste of money! Frontline, get it together or you will surely have problems with your customers!",0

"This is not the product I ordered. The original ordered in May of this year was altogether different, and, also like the Nudges Sizzlers ordered last week; it is a different product. This item weighs less, has a different package, and costs considerably more. More importantly, my dog rejects it.",0

"I returned this item. The quality is extremely cheap. It is nothing more than a thin plastic tray with a thin piece of turf covering it up. I was extremely disappointed in the quality. The picture on the box makes the grass look fluffy, but it is nothing like that. Not only that, but my dogs wouldn't even touch it. I really don't blame them because a ""welcome"" rug actually has more of a real grass feel than this. This is worth maybe $3, definitely not $20-something. In fact, you could probably go get a plastic tray and a piece of turf from Lowes and end up spending $5 and having something with far better quality.",0
This thing didn't last a day before our 15 lb dog had it in shreds.,0
"This is a great product!  We were told our cat would live another 6 months...due to kidney failure...that was 4 years ago!

"I adopted a 6 year old female Yorkie a year ago. She had been rescued from a puppy mill in Missouri where she had multiple litters of puppies and was caged in a small kennel. She looked pitiful when I got her. She had never had a treat of any kind, but soon understood what it was. These Dogswell Vitality treats with Flaxseed and Vitamins have contributed to transforming her (Brees) coat and skin. She looks beautiful now. I like that this treat has no added hormones, no fillers and no byproducts.  The only downside is that it is made in China.",1

My little Jack-a-Bee LOVES these Chicken Chips, but unfortunately they are made in China (Thank You Amazon Reviewers for bringing this to my attention!) and since we love our dog we won't be buying any more these as Chinese manufacturing quality is suspect, to say the least.

I wish the SmokeHouse people would address this issue and try to assure people that there is some sort of quality control is in place.

So disappointed.

"This product was a lifesaver for my little chiweenie! I adopted her from a shelter when she was 3 month's old and she had no training at all! She is very stubborn and impossible to train, so I had no luck house training her outside. She would go 12 hours without pottying because she refused to use the grass, so I got some puppy pads and started using them on my enclosed back porch. She caught on to the pads quickly, but sometimes missed. I saw this item at petsmart and it has been well worth it (although $10 higher there). I would definitely recommend this product for training or a permanent solution.",1
This did not help smelly dog smell.  I was very disappointed in this product.,0
They are still switching carbon filters out for these.  Just ordered 2 and both were carbon filters.,0
My dogs love these. They're the only ones they will take so I thought I could get them in bulk cheaper on here then was shocked at 5he price. I buy the 4 ounce bag at a local Dollar General for  $2.75 plus tax and Walmart carries the 12 ounce bag for $9 and some change. Just a little FYI,0
Not as durable as other Nylabone durachew. Love Nylabone brand though,0

"I purchased this for my daughter who is 14. She has a 5 pound yorkie and he fits great in it. It's comfortable and we know he can be in a safe spot when taking him out. He seems to like it, he even ducks down inside and takes naps at times.",1
"The product is great. However when purchasing you think your buying the bigger size and you can imagine my surprise once I got home and it wasn't even as big as my dog food bag. Looked at the measuring guide thought I was getting one for over 40 pounds and both containers together don't equal 40 pounds. Pretty upset with that over all feel like I was very mislead. The product is fine, but I could have bought one from overpriced pet smart for 5 more dollars than I paid and got the right size. Regretting my decisions. Thanks",0
"This product is very concentrated.  You do not have to use much.  I use this product in my Air Water Purifier by New Comfort.  I only use
two caps full of this product every two days.  The dog groomers that I visit uses this product.  I have never smelled a wet dog or any other
bad odor at this groomers.  This is where I got the idea to use it in my Air Water Purifier.  I have also introduced this product to a couple dental
offices that I work for.  They love it, and they have purchased their on Purifier.  The Orange is wonderful as well.  But I will say that the TiKi Beach is my favorite at the moment.  There are many other scents to choose from that I have not tried yet. You will just have to go to the Neutron Industries website.",1

"My wife and I have been using Joint Max for a couple of years now. Our Shepard mix had been having problems with her hind legs and the vet diagnosed her with arthritis. We went ahead and looked around for a joint product to help ease her pain. We just happened to stumble upon this one and have been amazed by the results. Our dog is running more and is much more active with this supplement. There were some days before where she had trouble even standing on one of her legs, but we haven't seen it since we have been giving this to her. We do recommend the chews. The dog loves them and we use them as treats, so there is no fuss with trying to get her to eat them. We highly recommend these if your dog is suffering from joint discomfort!",1

"I have an 18 month old Bloodhound/ German Shepard mix and she destroys EVERYTHING! She even ate one of my couches (no lies). I have had similar toys in the past, not quite to the scale of this piggy though. I had seen this toy numerous times at petsmart but I could not justify the $20 price tag on something I assumed the dog would destroy. When I saw it on amazon for nearly half the price I couldn't resist the cuteness anymore! When it came in the mail I immediately gave it to my beastly puppy and she loved it! She immedialty started carrying it around by it's snout, so I figured with in the hour the house would be covered in stuffing. Much to my surprise it's been well over a month and she still hasn't put a hole in it!! The ears are pretty chewed up and the tail is gone, but overall the body of this cute little piggy is still in very good shape. It has made me want to buy more cute creatures of the same brand and give her a little zoo. These dog toys are super tough and the longest lasting toy I have purchased.",1
I should have heeded the caution written in other reviews as my order arrived broken as well. I took a chance on this product but shouldn't have.

Great little light. Definitely for nano/pico tanks. I bought fir my 6 gallon fluval edge but I'm definitely going to need 1 more. Don't have many corals in thee yet but it makes my green tip hammer look awesome and the stripes on my clowns almost glow. The only drawbacks are 1) The gooseneck is too short so it doesn't light up the whole tank. 2) I wish the power chord was a little longer 3)No on/off switch although mine is hooked up to a timer so it's not too big of a deal. and  4)  The suction cup mount limits your mounting options,1
"I wasn't sure if this would keep our lab from inhaling her food, but it really worked. She normally scarfs a meal in 30-45 seconds. With this bowl it took her 8 minutes 30 seconds. Huge improvement!  The bowl was on hardwood while she ate and it didn't even slide around. We have only used it once so far. Time will tell if she can somehow outsmart the bowl.",1
"My experience with this Penn Plax Cascasde 1500 Canister Filter was not perfect but I am still willing to give it a 4 star with reasons below. I got this filter with a big discount (~$100). The first unsatisfying experience is that, the first time I received it, it has cracks at one of the locking clamps. I sent it back directly and got an replacement. The second frustrating experience is that once when I was readjust the intake tube and hose, I easily broke the intake tube. The plastic was really brittle. Since the filter has a 3-year warranty, I emailed the customer service and got a replacement part within a week.

Cons:

1) unsatisfying quality, the plastic is very brittle and breaks easily. Need to handle with great care;

Pros:
1) Easy to set up;
2) With huge space for media. 5 trays!
3) 3-year warranty and good customer service;
4) High flow rate, keep my aquarium very clear with debris quickly taken into the filter;

Overall, I wish this product could have a higher-quality plastic but could not complaint too much looking at its price. I will definitely handle with great care trying not to break the parts. But this seems quite likely. So I have two filter running on my aquarium, if this fails, I will call the company for replacement parts.",1
I was worried at first because harnesses have never fit well on my dog (he has kind of a funky build) but this harness fits great! I like the reflective stitching and the patches are sewn on beautifully. There are plenty of places to attach a leash or ID TAGS. I would buy this product again.,1
We have foster pups from time to time and this was a great value! Will be back for more!,1

"I have been using these collar covers on our cat for two years now, and not one bird has been killed during that time. We have a bird habitat in our back yard, so there are plenty of options for him, but they fly away as soon as they see the bright color. The squirrels see him easier and take off, too. The cat looks more like a clown than a cat, but these definitely work! I like the reflective bit around the edge of the collar for at night. Be sure to keep an extra breakaway collar and collar cover on hand, though. The breakaway collar works as it should, and our cat has lost a couple of them now. It's still worth it to protect the birds. Oh, he did catch a rat at the neighbor's house (they were happy!), so if you need your cat to be a mouser, these won't interfere.",1
Good. As represented. The dog really likes them as a treat.,1

No on/off control for heating element  Doesn't get very warm and is not big enough for my cat.  Attempted a return but I'm not paying shipping back when I'm a PRIME member.  Would not recommend this product.,0

"I do regret getting the four watt model instead of the six I guess.  The four watt is barely warm at all.  I think the six watt version probably strikes a better balance.  (You don't want it to actually be _hot_, just slightly warm.)  That said, this still works just beautifully.  My cats both sit on it quite a lot (they've very random about when and where they sit, so it's very hard to judge, but I do find them on it most of the time late at night when it gets cold) and I like that it is very low power.  I've been a little scare of leaving it on all the time for them, but I hooked it up to a fused power panel and set it on something where hopefully if a fire started it shouldn't spread.  That's me just being paranoid I think because so far it has been very safe and reliable and not once have I been woken up by smoke detectors.

As others have said, the material on top is a bit loose and the cats do like to tear it up a bit.  It actually holds up pretty well for all that they do though.  I do think it would have been better to have something a bit more solid on top (perhaps just another layer on top of this material?  It's very insulative and probably works beautifully for helping to keep the cats warm just on its own.)  Perhaps it might be worth putting it in a pillowcase or something later on.  For now the cats don't seem to be going to ruin it any time soon though.

So while I basically recommend this, I think the six watt version is probably the better choice.  I wouldn't want more than six though I think.  Still, this one works just great and I definitely recommend one of these two.  (And I definitely wouldn't want to go more than six watts.)",1

I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.,0
perfect thank you,1

"I just got this today. I have a nice one on order here and decided to just grab a cheap one until mine comes in and as a back-up heater. Mistake. I let this sit in the tank for an hour before I turned it on and three hours later, my son and I hear a loud pop. Imagine my horror as I can see water start to go up the unit and can see it still heating up. I quickly unplugged it and will be returning it to the store tonight. I don't expect a cheap heater to last a long time but I do expect it to last a night at least. I'm surprised by this though because Hagen usually makes some decent products. Avoid this heater and spend just a few dollars more for a better one.",0
"I purchased this harness for my my 17 pound Jack Russell Terrier and it is perfect (I also bought the matching leads, which are great too.)  He'd choke himself on walks with just his collar and this way, we can take long walks and when he chases after a squirrel or something else, he doesn't hurt himself.  It is pretty easy to put on and take off and I think it actually offers some measure of security for the dog too.  We've washed it in the washing machine a couple times and it seems no worse, so that's awesome.

As a side note, we recently adopted two new Jack Russells and bought two more larges (pink and blue) and the large is a bit too big for them (9 months, 12 pounds) but I think they'll grow into them.  Honestly, this is the best harness that I (or several other people who have see our dogs in them) have found...well worth the $.",1

She then shredded the firehouse, leaving long strings behind- the kind of strings I don't want in my pups intestines!",0
"This product is a miracle! Two years ago my dog had fleas so bad we couldn't get rid of them. We tried front line, flea collars, flea shampoo, and dips. Nothing worked.  We had to bathe her once a day sometimes twice a day to get rid of the fleas.  We finally tried Advantix the next summer and it worked like a charm.  Ever since we had to give her a bath every day, she has had ear problems.  We didn't know what the problem was.  I took her to the vet and they gave me antibiotics and said she would be okay.  The infection never really went away.  I took her to a new vet, they cleaned her ears out real well and gave me more anti biotics.  That didn't work.  We took her back to the vet and they cleaned them out again and gave us new antibiotics that were supposedly stronger.  This has been going on for two years.  Nothing the vet gave us ever worked.  My dog has been in agony for two years scratching her ears.  It broke my heart to watch her go through this pain every few days scratching at her ears.  She would yelp in pain.  She couldn't get a bath without the pain starting up.  It was terrible.  I finally came across this product and it is a MIRACLE! After just one day she is already better.  She let me put the drops in her ear the second day and she is fine.  She is not going crazy scratching her ears like she normal would.  This is a miracle, I highly recommend this!",1

You cannot charge the remote and the collar at the same time, only one at a time.  Each time you charge it, the transmitter has to be removed from the collar because the collar strap blocks the connector plug.  The transmitter on the collar is very large, and it sticks out pretty far off of the dog's body, and it makes it very uncomfortable for the dog if he/she is laying down.

These bowls are a really good size. We just adopted another rescue dog and he's a bulldog mix. So, he's a pretty hefty dog. I used one of the bowls the first night for feeding, but he gobbles his food down too fast. So, I have to use a maze feeding bowl instead. But, I use them for water bowls. I put one in the kitchen and one will go outside or in the shop for when we take him out side or to the shop with us.

I love the little bone on the bowl to make it more stylish designed. I like that they are dishwasher safe and since one will be outside use, I'm glad they are rust resistant. They seem to be a good quality product and very light weight.

 PROS:
easy to eat food or drink out of
nice bone design to make it fashionable

 CONS:
will slip when bigger dogs eat out of it.
behind the bone design it's kind of sharp

NOTE: when washing, be careful for behind the bone it's a little sharp

OVERALL: they are nice stainless steel bowls. Affordable and a good buy",1

I like it a lot and it holds a lot. Its strong so if you have a normal to large rabbit it can stand the constant jerking from the rabbits pulling out the hay. I gave it 4 stars because I have a dwarf rabbit and its too large. He jumps inside of it to get food. He is only 8 weeks so Im hoping hell grow into it some.,1
Absolutely love this leash.  I have two Golden Retrievers and they love to walk side by side.  I have tried other couplers but the dogs have always gotten tangled.  There is no tangling with this leash and the dogs can switch sides as many times as they like (which is quite often). One of my dogs pulls harder than the other but this has helped keep him back.  The handle is very comfortable and the leash itself is heavy duty.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who walks two dogs at once.,1
"I have a Yorkie and its the perfect size for him! Its his new favorite toy! He plays with it all the time, he sleeps with it, and carries it with him wherever he goes. Its small enough he can fit his mouth around it and light enough he loves playing fetch with it. So far the squeaker in the middle is holding up. Hes been putting it to the test! lol :)",1
"I don't believe in keeping dogs locked in a pen or tied up all day long like my 1 neighbor. Of course, mine are not working dogs and neither are his. I have the Stubborn dog collars for my Coonhounds that work on a 9 volt battery - these are very good. This little receiver I bought for my Rat Terrier pup and it works fine and keeps him in the yard, I just have to buy the Petsafe batteries and they don't last as long as a nine volt. The Stubborn dog collar is probably to heavy and I don't want to over shock the little guy. The good thing is they both work w/my electric property containment fence and once the Rat Terrier gets older, he won't need it. The Coonhounds would be in the next county w/o the shock collars no matter what age. My containment fence surrounds 25 acres.",1
I use this as a liner in my dog crate...and it works great!,1
"The fit was fine, but our Jack Russell was uncomfortable in this spandex type material and it kept sliding toward the back. He incessantly licked his neutered area and its now infected (I think the material should be breathable).",0
the dog uses them in the middle of the night so i don't have to take her out. what can i say,1
"It has  been two weeks since I started my two dogs on these tabs. I can already see a reduction in shedding! Normally I sweep ever other day, this week I swept just once! I see the main ingredient is Brewers yeast so this must do the job because they were on omega 3 fatty acids for the past few years and that did not reduce any shedding at all!",1
"Bought these to get rid of ""old house smell"" at my new place. Put 1 in each room. Helped some but didn't get rid of it completely.  Have an odd scent themselves.  Not bad...just odd that I can't compare to anything.",0
"My puppy was dumping over her water on daily basis in her inside dog run.  I was tired of cleaning up water everyday so I ordered this.  The quality is good, mine does not leak. My only complaint is that my baby has to work extremely hard to get a lot of water out.  But I guess she has nothing but time while I'm away at work which is the only time she is in her run.",1
"very poor quality, not usable as is",0
"The actual leash is simply a string and it has a leader at the end that looks like a child stitched it to the leash. The ""hook"" at the end is smaller than most leashes that holod up to 100lbs. This is not the same as a leash you would buy at Petsmart.",0
The product appeared to be having an effect on our dog and may have worked in time but we had to discontinue use.  It also bothered the cats!!!  WARNING:  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE CATS!  This should have been mentioned prior to purchase.  :(,0
"Smells good and leave the coat shining. Not fruity or sweety fragrance, smells clean .",1
"Great bags, a little difficult to open.  Need to wet your finger and then they are perfect.  Will definitely buy again now that i figured out the trick.",1
My dogs love these. I have 5 cocker spaniels and nothing makes for a better day then to top it off giving each one before bedtime..... They sleep sleep do good..... They really look forward to them!!,1
"Got this and my cat did not like it. She would NOT use it. The pellets do NOT help with smell. If she peed in a BRAND NEW pad, the whole house smelled like pee. The poop was even worse. The smell is not covered up. I would not recommend this system sadly.  I would not waste your money- I could NOT get a refund so I have something that does not work.",0
"Our 2 month old kitten is mildly interested in the toy... however, I expected that the lights wouldn't flash if they weren't playing with it (like certain squeak toys)...  I guess it doesn't say it on the packaging, but the lights stay on all the time.  I expect the battery will die fairly quickly and it does not look very replaceable.  We will be returning this item.  :(",0
Its compressed cardboard and started to fall apart within 5 minutes of use. The pieces don't exactly fit together right. Not very well made.,0
I purchased this for my new puppy. It is of high quality and is smooth w/o any irritating protrusions resulting in happy puppy.,1
"Was not filled like picture. Only had a small pillow, therefore there is a lot of empty fabric",0
Never even walked my dogs with this leash. Was outside on 3rd potty break when it broke. The stitching where leash was connected to metal ring came loose letting my 70 lb German Shepard run free.,0
Lid was broken when it arrived.,0
"It only works for a very short time, not even  a full day. But it does have a great smell",0
great product great sell,1
she loves it.,1
"love,love,love
great quality with good price.",1
The service dog vest that I ordered is perfect. It's very high quality. They also have great customer service.,1
Puppy ate right through it minutes,0
"This would have been a great product except the straps that go around the drivers side head rest were the wrong type.  There were (2) female ends, I had to buy a clip and rig up my own connection using string.  Also i am using this for my 13 week old puppy and he figured out very quickly that if he jumps up on the zipper it peals open very easily.  It would have been nice to have a better zipper and maybe a secure system to keep it from opening.",0
This collar barely worked to start and only got worse.  I have wasted $25 replacing batteries for short term minimal use.  Defeats the purpose of training if the collar doesnt stay working consistently.  Very unsatisfied,0
"We have a 50# dog.  This toy lasted all of 25 minutes.  Within the first 5 minutes, she had the black edging off in one place.  5 minutes after that, she had taken the fluff out of it, and was flinging it around the room.  After another 15 minutes of chewing and biting and pulling, she had the casing totally opened, and the squeakers exposed.  That's when we took it away, and she made us feel like the most horrid pet parents EVER.  This was $12 I'm not ever getting back.",0
"Our cat played with this toy less than 10mins before it was broken, due to the thin line holding the fish to the suction wand.",0
Our dog don't like it . But we do thak u,1
"This was stated as a large dog holster,  it was tiney. Did not fit my dog.",0
This toy broke after one day. I was VERY disappointed as was my cat and I felt completely ripped off.,0
"I started buying this cat food when it first came out and my very old and newly indoor cat loved it (she lived on my parents' farm most of her life).  The problem with it is that they have stopped carrying it in stores.  I can occasionally find a ""chunky"" version with gravy such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friskies-Selects-Indoor-Cat-Food-2-Flavor-Gravy-Variety-Pack-Turkey-Chicken-5-5-Ounce-Cans-Pack-of-24/dp/B00283MYWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friskies Selects Indoor Cat Food, 2-Flavor Gravy Variety Pack (Turkey & Chicken), 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, but rarely, if ever, the pate anymore.  She will eat the other version but has trouble with the big pieces, so I like to have the pate for her regularly.

I first tried switching her to a different cat food (such as the regular Friskies instead of the Indoor), but that only resulted in her throwing up or coughing up a hairball every day for a good month.  So I was thrilled when I found these on Amazon.  I'm worried that I only find it occasionally now and the prices seem to be going up every time I look.  Usually it is cheaper to get the version that only has chicken, but I prefer to get different flavors when I can.  As of this moment, the other pate options I look at on here are sold through other merchants and as such typically have a shipping charge added on.  I sincerely hope that Amazon continues to carry it and can settle on a fair and steady price.",1
"The batteries sometimes don't last more than 2 days, other times they last 1 mo. Constantly saying CHK battery. Very unreliable and then my cat tips it over and all the food comes pouring out the top.",0

"My 10 month old German Shepherd puppy destroyed this in 24hrs. I expected more from KONG. The squeaker was the first to go, He loves toys that squeak. Then the strips of fabrics went.  I had to take it away he was pulling fibers off the bulb or main piece. I didn't want the pieces to cause blockages in his digestive system. He has Kong balls that still squeak after months of use. So very DISAPPOINTED!",0
Nice amount for the,1
"These balls have become my German Shepherds favorite toy, She takes it everywhere and i know where she is because of the squeaker.  A must have for dogs that love balls and squeaker sounds!!!",1
Not recommend ,0
"This is a great dog collar. We have a sensitive, old (15 years!) border collie and we are super careful about what we put on her. This is a great collar because right away it is soft and feels broken in. Not at all like the ones from pet stores that feel stiff. And it is good to know it is from a company with a conscience. Nice to help my dog while doing a small bit of good in the world. Thanks!",1
"Love! Love! Love, this dang kitty mat, its AMAZING!! Only sweeping a quarter of the litter that my cat was tracking thru my house now! All the liter that was stuck in her paws drops in the combs!",1
Cleared my dogs ears up in less that 48 hours!  Great product.  Saved me a big vet bill.,1
Did not work crap,0
We have two maltese dogs. No more tangled leash with this. The width of the leash is little wider than I would like.,1
Less than 1 star. These things are see through. A newspaper would do a better job. I buy a lot of pee pads for my pup and these are the thinnest ones I have ever seen. Returned.,0
This food is not what you think... It is very high in calcium and phosphorus which is causing crystals and stones in our pets urine. It is also a very rich food which is causing GI upset and pancreatitis. Marketing is a dangerous thing.,0
Fun for the cats they are having a blast . great to throw for them,1
Was missing the nail clippers.,0
Burnt my birds feet! Too hot. If I had the money I would sue you.,0
"At first these looked quality! 3 months later, washing one time a week, total junk. The ""fuzzy"" side of the Velcro is almost all gone so it won't stick plus the entire Velcro part is almost ripped off. See pictures.",0
"When I finally got it, the bottles leaked. So never got to use it.",0
"Love it, delivered quickly",1
"Wow, this thing is huge.  I can see why another reviewer made it into a house.  I would do the same, but was nervous it would confuse the cat and who wants cat urine where it's not suppose to me!",1
"Second set. These are MUCH MUCH BETTER than the order 2 years ago. These are dual sided, made of a thick plastic like surface. It is too hot in the summer to make my boy wear his vest. These work very well 24/7 to show he is a Service Dog. Since I am in an electric wheelchair I don't have the problem of people questioning why I have a Service Dog even though he has nothing to do with that disability. I had an accident & injured my pancreas & Otis senses when my blood sugar drops & lets me know before I get in trouble.
These tags are double sided, show well at night too. He has tags with his name & mine engraved on them but they are metal & make noise. These are quiet & far superiir to the tags I got from this company 2 years ago. Both of the old tags broke & 1 fell off never to be found again. Hopefully these will wear as well as they look.",1
"These are AMAZING!!!  I am not just saying that either.. for the price these are so sweet.. With the timer is set and they run themselves. I bought them 1 at a time because I was leary at first, but 3 days after hanging 1 over my 80 gal tank my coral was blooming.

My only caution is there are no I structures on how to set them up really.  But after a few short minutes I figured it out so it isn't to hard.",1
"I thought I did my research for a tape leash with flash lights.  REGRET BUYING!!!  It is suppose to be rated for dogs up t o 350 pounds.  My German shepherd is only 75 pounds and after only two months, the leash is messing up.  Now I am worried that it will break loose and I cannot risk my dog getting loose since she is aggressive towards other female dogs...  I started the return process, but after just 59 days, I discovered it is not eligible for return under the Amazon policy.  I am having problems finding the return process for the third party vendor.  (I'm NOT happy about wasting $30), but I cannot use this malfunctioning leash.",0
"We have owned a variety of Littermaid boxes over the years and the current one is the LitterMaid model LME5500. The last Littermaid box survived about a year before dying which is pretty typical for this brand. This Littermaid box was purchased May 9,2010 at Target and registered on the same day. It died abruptly yesterday. After trying all the self help steps we finally found a wire that has torn itself almost in half which is causing the rake arm not to sweep and clean out the box. So right now it's a large smelly paperweight full of cat waste.

If you try calling the customer service number (800-548-6243)it's an exercise in frustration as it's constantly busy and they ask you to leave a voice mail with all the information. They promise to call you back which they haven't done in two days time. One important thing to note is this poor customer service also includes the brands-Black&Decker, Toastmaster, SonicWeb, Breadman, Juiceman, Farberware, Russell Hobbs, and George Foreman (see prodprotect.com). So I urge caution before purchasing any of the other brands too since customer service is nonexistent.

The downside to this model is- it's loud and it jams frequently. The rake is plastic with thin wires and if your cat has large urine balls or stool it will jam and not clean the box. We line the plastic waste receptacle tray with a plastic grocery bag and remove it once a day. Six months is not worth the price we paid and since customer service has fallen off the map we've decided this is the last Littermaid box we will own. It's time to try another brand. The last improvements to Littermaid have not been improvements. This is a piece of junk masquerading as a litterbox. Save your money and avoid the frustration.",0
"After reading reviews and size guidelines we were disappointed a large didn't fit our 65 lb dog.  Per Amazon's website it couldn't be exhanged for a XL and we had to pay for return shipping.

Be certain you order the correct size.",0
"This was a great purchase for our 70lb Golden Retriever. Fits great in the back of my Honda Civic. The material appears to be very durable and I was happily suprised to find that it was thick and very soft. I had a full hammock, but need the one backseat. I also like the fact that it prevents your dog from pacing back and forth... keeps them confined in a comfy space.",1
absolutely love this! My dog loves it as well. Very sturdy and easy for me to get undone but she cant get it off. Best collar I have bought in a long time.,1
It worked great the first two times i used it and then one side started coming apart when I could open the jaw to scoop poop.  I noticed that the plastic on one of the parts that connects the handle to the jaw was broken thus causing the jaw to fall open on one side. It's really frustrating because it got such good reviews.  I guess mine was just defective.,0
"Durable, and not cheaply made like other inexpensive leashes. I have a bouncy puppy who zooms everywhere, and the clasp has not broken! :)",1
cats love it!!,1
Fast shipping- excellent quality bags . They are strong and the scent is not over-powering.  I like them scented as our dog knows when he sees/smells the bags we are out for a reason and not to play about at 5am!! I will buy again.,1
"My border collie mix is very sensitive to fireworks and thunderstorms. On July 4th, I gave him a dose with his supper at 5pm and by fireworks time at 9pm, he was calm although not completely settled in. He did not do his usual panting and hiding behind the couch.  He just hung out close to us. This product definitely helped.",1
My dogs love it! I ordered another bag last week!,1
"This is perfect!  I don't use it to pour anything out, but it keeps the dry dog food fresh.  It fits a 30lb bag for me just fine.  top is very easy to open and snap shut each time we go to scoop out food.  It also doesn't take up much space because of the shape, so it's easy for storing in our closet.",1
This is a well made product and is very versatile.,1
To small and not sturdy enough,0
Excellent product! Works well to relax your cat! I would say purchase these treats before buying those pricey pills! If your cat will not eat them as a treat just crunch up in his or her favorite food! Follow the doseing instructions as they r treats but not to excede recommend doseing for your cats,1
good product - good transaction,1
"These are my new favorite doggie accessory!  We have three wiggly Yorkies and these harness/vests are so soft, comfortable, and easy to put on.  They are very well made and the colors are vibrant and fun.  Highly recommend!",1
Older Kong bones had bigger openings that were perfect for treats.  The newer version has such small openings that it is difficult to fit anything without having o chop up the treats...,0
"This is overpriced for what you get. It breaks easily and does not stay put together without additional reinforcements. Also, it is made for a small litter box. I had to cut out part of the back to make the litter box fit, so do your measurements first.",0
Really a coincidence---border matches the tile in my kitchen & the walls are accented in grey!!!,1
"Good deal, on filters for the filtered litter box, that I ordered, and good to keep on hand, they last about 3month, if not longer, and they fit!  yey!!!",1
The bulb blew after 1 month,0
"This door is great. My dog took a little time to learn to use it but now goes in and out whenever she wants. I like this because I did not like for her to be stuck in the house all day while I was at work.  I have an unusual  set up at my rent house.  There are two patio doors in the doorway.  I have never seen it anywhere else but it's great for me.  I stuck the dog door in the inner sliding door without having to permanently install because I can close and lock the outer door and still have security at night.  The dog door does not jiggle around or anything. It is just held in place by the spring on the top of the door that makes the door fit different heights of patio doors.  For this reason I cannot give an opinion on installation.  I think it might not be SUPER easy. My dog is about as tall as a German Shephard and I bought the largest and glad I did.  The opening itself is not any larger, it is just placed higher in the door so she can go out without scraping her back or squatting down to get out. Quality is good. Flap is pretty good for keeping out wind.",1
I have pit bulls. They are prone to skin problems. I have noticed a great improvement in their coat condition and shine. They feel softer to me as well. There is no smell and it's easy to put in their food. They really love it.,1
Very cute except packaging. All 4 Doggie shirts Ruined from essential oils leaking into them. Oil stain will not come out.,0
Very good quality would buy again,1
Great product for the price.  Wish they had a larger one just like it.,1
I look for toys with out stuffing this one takes the cake. Even with it being punctured it will squeak,1
"Whimzees are SIGNIFICANTLY tougher than greenies or most other teeth cleaning treats- I initially thought this was good because my dog can tear through treats in seconds, but it ended up chipping her molar tooth and now will cost close to $1K for surgery!!!

I'm never buying whimzees again!",0
"They offer 4, so one would assume the dog could wear them as slippers?
Wrong.
Also, why would you pay for these as a chew toy, since the company includes one for FREE with their other products?
If you're convinced this would make a good toy (it doesn't), just buy another, more useful Petoga product and you will get one of these silly things for free.",0
Very disappointing.  I thought since this was a Kong product it would be more durable.  My doxie had a hole chewed in the head and stuffing coming out in no time.,0
"This is the greatest bowl for water for my cats.  It's large enough that when I put fresh water in there, there is plenty of water for all day. The bowl is relatively lightweight, so it's easy to carry, but I've never had my pets tip it over.  I like the nonslip ring on the bottom because my elderly cat doesn't have to chase it across the tile.

We have super hard water where we are, and this bowl does get mineral deposits, but soaking it in a vinegar solution (I use half vinegar half water) gets it nice and clean.  It goes through the dishwasher beautifully.

The only potential downside to this bowl is that, because it's fairly lightweight, a dog intent on flipping it could probably flip it.  Even my cat who always puts her paw in the water has never flipped it, though.",1
"While the bed is fluffy and comfortable for the pup, the quality could simply be improved and I've had to throw out my insert. The cover is not waterproof (as stated in multiple comments) and when my puppy peed on the bed, the pee soaked through to the memory foam insert. The cover is machine washable - the inner bed is not. I hand washed the insert bed and it still smelled of dog pee - as expected since it soaks into the foam. The only way to recover from this pee incident was to wash the insert, which in turn ripped a hole in the casing and let foam go all through the washing machine. **All of this is NOT covered in their warranty** Aka the bed insert was trashed and would need to be repurchased or refilled by another brand. Not a happy with the product for a puppy.",0
"This is a great vest that is very well fitted. I have bought similar vest and they were too small but this is absolutely perfect! I will feel safe taking my dog for walks in the woods with this.

It is very well made and high quality.",1
Not a flavor that appealed to my dogs.,0
"Our adult 65 pound lab/pit bull mix has always made walking her a major chore, nearly impossible with her amazing strength and barrel chest.  We had been using a choke collar out of sheer desperation, which was nearly useless and gave me great concern for my dogs neck.  The last straw was when My 10 year old boy had to hit the ground to keep our dog from running after rabbits.  We quit walking her and I went to the internet to find a solution, this harness was it!  Even my slight 8 year old daughter can control her now.  I am amazed at how well this works for such an inexpensive item.  Really a great product.  It may take a little getting use to, the one thing to keep in mind is do not pull back on the leash.  This will result in the dog falling to the ground when it's front legs instantly fold.  Just hold the leash steady in one place without pulling back and the dog responds!  My son was use to holding on with all of his might and yanking back to keep her from running off so it has been a nice adjustment for us.  We are a happy pet walking family again!",1
Not great for Huskies who even as puppies will figure out how to get out.,0
My fur-babies were bored with this in minutes.  The string is to short and there is no way to put a longer string tied to it.  Great concept poor execution.,0
"These were very cute on my old Dobergirl, but they wore through in less than a week, and she even had surgery one of those days, wasn't walking much the whole week. I bought them to help give her traction on the floors, but they are really just decorations. Very disappointed!

If you're buying to look nice, a bit of advice on sizing: the chart seems to work well if your dog is a normal weight. If it's very heavy (fat), you should size them based on your dog's normal weight, as the toenails do not grow with its girth.",0
This is Quality!  Nice long scoop for my back after surgery.  Long but not heavy.  Sturdy but not clumsy.  This is a great long handled scoop!,1
"I purposely didn't purchase a similar item at the larger petstore because I thought I could find it cheaper on Amazon.  Turns out after much research that it is twice as much online than in the store. If there was an offer on Amazon that had prime shipping then it would be worth it, probably.

the item itself reminds me of wet balled up newspaper and not the ""fluff"" that I am familiar with",0
I have a cat with megacolon surgery and I switched from regular Friskies to this cat food to help him pass hairballs. Sometimes I put a few drop those extra virgin olive oil in with these dry foods and he digests very well now.,1

I used this on a cross country trip and it was great.  Unfortunately my dog managed to chew through it when it wasn't on her but I ordered another one.,1
"I bought this exact dog right before I brought my puppy home (2-16). This dog has been like a security blanket for her.  I picked her out at 2 weeks old brought her home at 8 weeks old with a litter blanket and put her to bed with this dogs each night. She would suck the feet till she fell asleep. She is almost 2 now and still falls asleep every night with her pup pup. The thing is all the feet are nearly bald now and the seams are pulling apart from her kneading it. So I decided to buy her 2 new ones. The thing is it is not made of the same durable material. Her pup pup is the only stuffy she has ever owned that she has not torn to shreds. These 2 new pup pups I bought her are just like any other stuffy I would buy for her they are soft,plush, feels flimsy and it is smaller than the original with large stiff Velcro strips that are the first things that drew her attention. She wanted to rip it open right away to get the Velcro out of it. Definitely not worth the money the 2nd time around. In the photos you can see the mesh where the fur has been nursed away so that even her teeth did not make holes as she has gotten older but this new dog does not have the same thick reinforced mesh underneath.",0
"Thank you Dr. Jennifer & Dr. Scott for making a high quality, pharmaceutical grade product! I thought I was doing all the right things for our Golden, feeding her quality food, giving her additional vitamin supplements and salmon oil daily. So I was surprised that she started to get dry flaky skin and start scratching! Luckily I found out about your product at just about the time this started happening. I switched out the salmon oil and started using your Premium Pet Omega icelandic fish oil for 3 weeks now and her dry flaky skin is all cleared up! Started noticing the difference soon after we started giving it to her. The fact that its odorless and she likes the taste is a big plus!!!",1
Didn't work with my dog. I put the collar with full spray on him. My dog barks until the spray is over and keeps barking.,0
My dog has actually been having more itching than before I started using this hypoallergenic shampoo.,0
"OMG the smell is overwhelming.  I purchased for my senior that has some serious skin issues.  Her dinner conists of a can of salmon (people food) and a scoop of Wellness for weight issues.  She LOVES her salmon, but the smell of this was soooooo strong that she actually would not touch her dinner and ran upstairs until I made her another dinner without the oil.  The next night I added just a half of one pump and she had the same reaction - back uptairs.  I tried on my boy dog - he ate it but had severe gastrointestinal issues (cleared out the living room, seriously) and spent a good part of the next two days ""trotting"" back and forth in the backyard.  I do not recommend.",0
"So many times I have used this product yet I never learn my lesson, I keep buying them!!! I was first in line to use it when my vet started carrying it in his office YEARS and YEARS ago. First try, my vet charged me an arm and a leg to put them on, they came off in less than a week, losing the first in less than 24 hours. Second round, I do it myself, again, off in less than 24 hours last one in about 2 weeks. I have tried them about 10 more times with a few cats since then , last being a few weeks ago (because my vet said they have been improved) and I have NEVER had a positive experience. These paws get VERY expensive over time if you have a cat that knows how to take them off (which isn't hard to do).  My cat has had problems retracting his claws, digestion issues (fun finding these in your cats feces when you forget about them..SCARY..lol), choking issues (the paws have gotten caught in fur-balls which are hard enough to choke up without having a piece of plastic mixed in) and has had an infection caused by his nail growing THROUGH the cap, one by the cap getting stuck causing his nail to bend and the last one which was caused by FECES getting stuck in the cap. Both times my cat had to be taken in so the caps could be removed by the vet who told me that I was not the first person to have had this experience. I am finally done with them after the last infection cost me 200.00 at the vet because the infection spread to his paw! No more Soft paws for this family, we will find another way! Too much of a hassle that costs too much money and so far has been just as inhumane to our cat as de-clawing would have been.",0
"We bought this for our 35 lb Goldendoodle.  She LOVES it.  It is made very well.  We probably could have bought one size smaller (than the 40 inch), but she loves to sprawl out so the extra room is okay :)  Would definitely buy this bed again.",1
"Even though before the expired date range, like a few other reviewers experienced, this arrived so coagulated that t would have to be slowly cooked to return to some semblance of a liquid state.  My hound dog, who eats *anything* and feces from all species, would not get closer than 6 inches to this.  I was worried because it's a third party seller, but when I completed the return request, I was almost immediately granted a refund and advised there was no need to return the product.  So if you're not sure about it, at least rest assured that Amazon's customer service will make it worth your effort to try it out.",0
This can not be left out in the rain or snow. If you wanted to put it in an enclosure it would work.,0
"We have two kittens and these are, by far, their favorite toys.  The first two (one per kitten) lasted about a day.  At this point we figured we would just have to buy more and keep a stock of them.  However, the rest have lasted roughly an hour before they are torn open. It is a real shame that these aren't more durable.  Given this I would not recommend them.",0
"Sizing is insanely off. I have a L size wearing dog this shirt is for maybe a fat Chihuahua not a border collie mix, disappointing.",0
Dogs enjoy playing with the bats once they manage to get one out.  Some times they need a little help.  They also just like to push the pumpkin around.  Have to keep an eye on them because they like to chew ears off of other toys.  They would destroy the bats if given the chance.  Don't leave them unattended.,1
I love all Chris Christensen products.  Like the sample packs which let me try before buying large bottles.,1
"This was sent by a third-party shipper.  I orderd 3 boxes and all three boxes had expired - one back in 2011!  They told me once they received it back, they would resend my order.  It's now going on three weeks and I still have not received the replacement shipment.",0
"It's okay, no REAL instructions on what the plus and minus buttons are for...is the plus for higher zap? or when he barks is it for a quicker response to STOP the barking. I don't really get it.  Collar doesn't stay taut around the neck either.  My dog can shake his head and it comes loose...then barks his head off until I can get to him to fix it..not a good training tool if that doesn't work.",0
really cute!,1
"This fencing system is a horrible waste of money!

It is constantly re-setting itself- even when the power hasn't gone out. It's difficult to reset as well. I get to spend hours every week listening to its sensors shriek from the garage.

The training remote is constantly losing contact with the collar- making it useless for correction.

Worst of all, the collar is poorly made. The closure for it is garbage. Our dog could easily remove it. After a short two months of use, the collar fell off, the dog disappeared, and then the maintenance man ran over the lost collar with the lawn tractor. It's $120 to replace it.

Quite frankly, I'd rather dig up the entire fence and buy another brand than replace this useless, non-functioning, poorly made collar!",0
"After finding out how harmful rawhides are for dogs digestive systems, I've read about bully sticks and decided to give it a try. They are 100% natural and digestible. What makes braided bully sticks better is that they last longer. My dogs absolutely love these. I've tried both thick and medium bully sticks. My dogs prefer the thick bully sticks. They last longer than the medium ones. I've found this product to be better quality and are offered at a great price. I recommend ordering from this company as I have found a difference in the quality when you order from other companies.",1
"This stuff is worse than cat nip. It does not keep the cats (I have several) away at all. It smells very strong, it's rather that I stay away than my cats. Dogs love to lay any surface I sprayed with it, too. Complete waste of money.",0
"2/16
So my ferrets absolutely love this, but I now have a problem. I decided to do a bit a research and basically this is horrible to give to ferrets. Although my ferrets' coat did soften a bit, this is full of sugars. Sugar is very bad to give ferrets, it can make them very sick. Do not give this to you pet.
----------------------------
4/15
I got this for two reasons, 1: supposedly this is the catnip of the ferret world and makes claw trimming easier, and 2: the place I got my ferret from didn't seem to care for her too well so her fur is rather rough and dull. I put this in her food and she absolutely loves this, and after just two days, her fur is very soft and is looking so much healthier.",0
"I've had this collar for months. People just trip over this thing. I walk my dog at night when it's hot. She's black, well trained and doesn't use a leash. When we get to the park, she is free to do as she wishes and I can see her wherever she goes. When we are walking on a busy street sidewalk, drivers can see her. It stays lit up bright for a little over an hour. It charges in half an hour. It's a very well spent 10.00.",1
My Beagle loves when I get her a Benebone!  Great shape and last relatively long...I also feel like its better for her teeth than some of the other harder chew bones on the market.  Will be buying again and again.,1
"It took a grown man, me, about 15 minutes working with pliers to open this thing. Then when I filled it with water I realized it was now impossible to put the plug back in! The only thing that was good about it is the dogs got really excited seeing me working so hard and cursing at their toy.",0
Our 6 pound puppy loves these! The size is small enough I can give her several and know I'm not over-treating her!,1
"Looks nice. Great size for avoiding having to vacuum the floor all the time
when we use those small mats. Quick delivery.",1
Super cute and just the right size for my sugar glider. Has a nice adjustable strap as well. Only thing wrong is the back pocket was not sewed well it can with a hole in it. It is still useable I'll just have to re sew the hole.,1
"Do not waste your money. Cheap, nothing like the photograph, took weeks to arrive. Looks like something you'd win at the fair but not that quality level.",0
"As shipped, it was useless. Two of the four tabs that attach the top to its bottom were broken and loose in the shipping box. The remaining two tabs would not align and snap into holes. My husband bought self tapping screws and used some of the holes to attach the bottom to top.",0
Only product I'll use in  winter. Must protect dog's feet.,1
Best bang for your buck.,1
I have three dogs. None of them ride in a vehicle without being buckled in. I wouldn't let a child ride without a seatbelt and neither are my babies! This harness fits well and is easy to adjust.,1
"My 13 year old doxie loves this food, makes his coat shiny and he is still active at 13",1
"Why didn't someone think of this sooner? I have a cat AND a dog, and this litter box solved two very annoying problems:

1) The cat sometimes missed the litter box and ended up piddling on the floor, which resulted in many clean ups and lingering ammonia odors for days afterward.
2) The dog, a terrier mix, thought the kitty litter box was a snack bar.

Now the cat cannot piddle outside the box because she is deep inside with the opening over her head. And the dog is too short and not quite bright enough to get her face into the opening.

Thank you Clevercat!!",1
Worked very well. Better than I expected. Killed the odor and wiped out the pee stains. Will be buying more.,1
"I had picked up a little 5 gallon from CL. It surprisingly had some plants mixed in the gravel, although they looked pretty dead, and a little trumpet snail that surprisingly survived! Once I got it all scrubbed out and set up I hit Amazon for accessories.

The LED light that came with it was/is okay, but I read a lot of reviews about it only supporting low light plants. These plants are not that. I also wanted blue light for the evening. This light is perfect!

You can see a definite difference in the light from this. The regular ""white"" is a combination of the blue, green, and red lights. It looks crisp and clean. And the plants are getting full spectrum lighting! I've only had it 1-2 weeks and all of the plants are sprouting new leaves! I'm so glad I decided to splurge and get a better light! Totally worth it.",1
"Seems to be working pretty well but bottle difficult to hold and spray, cumbersome small spray bottle should be included perhaps",1
My dogs loved it!,1
These treats are a bargain as an add-on item.  Other products that are similar are very expensive and produced in other countries.  I believe these are from the U.S. as they claim USDA inspected.  My cats love them!,1
Great product - didn't see another flea.  Frontline was no longer effective so we gave this product a try - glad we did.,1
"My dogs loved them. I wish they came in a bigger size as I have 2 large dogs. Only will order again if larger size. I would like to see the flips available online. I get them from my vet, but it's a 40 min drive in traffic.",1
"This product is great, I have 3 German shepherds that have had skin issues. After taking the salmon oil daily with their food, issues have disappeared. . Their coats are beautiful. I highly recommend .",1
It isn't helping our dog stop shaking at all.,0
"Flimsy, rips, ineffective. Sheets are very hard to separate.",0
"A simple yet portable bowl. We used it for our trip to Texas. Simple, small, yet large enough for enough water and food. Easy to hand wash.",1
"rides up under dogs front paws, does not aide in walking or lifting comfortably",0
"Bought this for my 6#  yorkie, who destroyed/shredded this within an hour.  Not worth the money I spent...I definitely regret this purchase!!!",0
"Parrots, greys and a Citron, reluctantly eat it ( prefer fresh vegetables and fruit ( and cornbread!).  Maybe half the cost of pet store prices and nutritious. Good for those weekends when you don't have time to prepare fresh. I mix a few almonds and a very few sunflower seeds to get them started.  By day's end it's all gone.",1
These smell really bad...but my lab likes them and his breath is better for a few hours after he eats them,1
Daughters cat hates it,0
Gave this rambler toy to my dog and within 10 minutes he had the ball removed and half torn apart.  This was a total waste of my money.,0
"AMAZING PRODUCT!!!! I have a cattle dog who sheds like crazy. I was sceptical at first when buying this that it would not be durable, but boy was I wrong! I was blown away at what a great job it did! I would recommend to everyone who is looking for a great deshedder!",1
Garbage. Brand new out of the box and won't turn on. I can't recommend this.,0
Works great,1
"I read all the wonderful review, measured my boxer/lab mix paw and ordered the medium per the measurements. His about 67 pounds, medium built and frame. Bottom line, they don't fit, they are not manufactured in such a way that I can pull the Velcro over. Its almost like they are too narrow, like a person that wears a size 7 shoe, and not matter what that is the size they were but they were a medium width or a large width. Just trying to describe my dissatisfaction with these product that I was very excited to obtain.

Now I am trying to sell them on craiglist or whoever else can take them off my hands because they are brand new and my dog has never used them.

I ordered them forever and ever ago, pull them out time to time when I think they will be necessary but nothing changes, like my husband said, they aren't going to be anymore useful to us then they were the last time you tried to put them on him.

Decided to write these review as I was looking for another brand and option to purchase.",0
Didn't last long for my dog,0
"I had to return this light because the remote stopped working after 2 days. That wouldn't have been a big deal, but the light was stuck on blue which provided almost no light. I would not buy this again.",0
"Total garbage. Took over an account with 6 locations that were all set up with these P.O.S.'s. All locations were less then a year old, 5 out of 6 leaked first time I opened to change media. Almost impossible to seal. Even after trying all the tricks of the trade to get an O-ring to seal you still have to hold your head tilted to the left' tongue slightly out and hope Saturn isaligned with Venus for this junk not to leak. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.",0
Am pleased with all my purchases.,1
my fish love this product like nothing else !,1
"Super well made, nice a light in the hands, neoprene padding in the handle.",1
"My 17 year old kitty was given 1 capsul daily sprinkled on her food. After 3 weeks, she developed severe diarrhea.
I stopped the dosage and within a week she was back to normal. Maybe this may help some cats, but this medication was not for my girl. I believe that the senior cats should be monitored closely with all medications.",0
"My rat terrier loves these treats. Buckley Functional Immunity Dog Jerky Treats are a winner on many points. Number one being my dog craves them. What good are treats if your dog won't eat them? These are made in America. Have very limited ingredients. They are grain free. These contain super foods Chia, Blueberries, & Cranberries. The jerky strips themselves are about a fingers length on average. They do not have a strong or pungent smell. I held out two different strips, one Hill's Science Diet Jerky Strips (Beef), and Buckley Immunity Jerky Strips. My dog immediately grabbed the Buckley which I think says it all.",1
If I could give zero stars I would. My dog had this destroyed in under 30 minutes... maybe this toy is better for a small toy breed.,0
"I have three cats, and I hate the constant scooping. I thought this would be a great option. However, one of my cats refused to use it. She peed on my bed, the laundry, anything but the Breeze system. After doing everything possible, I finally got out the old litter boxes. Although I still have the Breeze set up, three out of three cats still prefer the old litter to the Breeze. The problem with the Breeze is that it works against their instincts. They can't bury the poop with those meager pellets. Also, the pellets don't mask the scent, so you have to scoop almost immediately after they poo or risk a stinky house.

Good idea in theory. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for me.",0
"My greyhound chewed through this toy in about 15 minutes. She loved it, but it was way too flimsy and can be dangerous because the squeakers came out very easily.",0
"This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a while. The day I received it the thing started falling apart. When putting it in my car the rings started coming off (where the straps go through). It did not fit my car properly, no matter how we tried it. I could have lived with the improper fit but the cheap quality is what really ticked me off. Pretty much every ring on this thing is gone now, after just one use.",0
It worked great at first but after about a month it started to come apart. The stairs wouldn't stayed screwed on and the top is so flimsy and wobbly when our cat gets up there.,0
My dog loves it!,1
Our new puppy has been very pleased with this product. Great ingredients and flavor for out dog. I also feel that the amount for the price is very fair. We have become regular customers.,1
"First of all the glass aquarium came in without the top. I alerted Amazon and they sent me another order and again, the aquarium came without the top but it was damaged and UPS had to return it to Amazon. Third time, the same thing happened with the aquarium coming in without the top. It also showed on the ad that the stand was part of it but the stand never did come. If the stand does not come with the item, that should be specified. I paid a lot of money for this item but the aggravation was too much. Amazon customer service, on the other hand was very nice and sympathetic to my dilemma. They shipped the item timely and I was given a partial refund for the top since I had to buy it from a different party. I did not ask for the bottom portion because I did not want the additional hassle. Overall, satisfaction with the experience is a minus (but no rating available for that) the customer service personnel are over and above awesome because they are truly helpful. Bad experience but customer service is superb.",0
One can for $10.25. I thought it was the price of a case. Plus it took a month to receive my one can of dog food and it arrived in a huge box.,0
"I ordered this carrier as it was described on Amazon as fitting a pet weighing up to 12 lbs. When it arrived the tag with it said that for pets with a maximum weight of 8 lbs. In addition the actual dimensions were smaller than stated on Amazon. It did not come close to being big enough for my 7.5 Lb dog. I was very disappointed.

Amazon was very good about issuing a return label and refunding the purchase price.",0
"Best thing you can buy for walking a ""strong willed"" dog PERIOD.  I struggled with my GSD for months.  Treat and click, click and treat.  He would walk ok but, Squirrel!........sorry.  That predator drive and protective instinct was too much and too frustrating and embarrassing when he would act out in public.  First walk on the Gentle Leader he fell back into ""Heal"" and stayed there.  Greeting people he doesn't jump up, he can't lunge at other dogs, and walks are enjoyable.",1
These areally awesome!  My dog goes crazy for these!  Minus one star because the first one I bought was a dud and didn't chrip.  After I exchanged it thought the 2nd one was perfect!  Because of this issue I do recommend you buy at a local store instead so you can make sure it works before paying for it.,1
It took my gerbil less time to chew this to bits than it took me to put it together. I'm giving it 2 stars because my gerbil enjoyed chewing it. The manufacturer should make it out of thicker cardboard & make it easier to put it together.,0
Thank you smell great!,1
"These are very large, about 4"" long and maybe 1 1/2"" diameter. We are very pleased with size and function of item.",1
did not work.,0
I love this color. It's just the right width for my eight pound dog. The color is also very pretty. I have the matching retractable leash to it and it looks adorable together.,1
"Been giving this to our dog religiously on top of the bully max food...didn't see a result so I discontinued it...he was 12 weeks old when we started these, so it's not like he was old or anything...very disappointed",0
"product as advertised.  fast delivery,",1
No hanging bracket.. So basically useless,0
"All my rescues have been DNA tested. Great product. I would recommend anyone with a mixed breed dog do this. It can flag some individual breed concerns regarding their overall health. As well as it's nice to have a ""Pedigree"". and ""papers"" to show off your mutt to those snooty ""purebred"" dog people.",1
"This was a gift for a friend that had surgery, I had to treat the cats to some goodies in the basket as well. The cats loved the toys and my friend really appreciated not having to entertain them. Amazing price and perfect timing on the shipping. I would highly recommend this product and site. I ordered this Grab bag assorted 20 pieces cat toys bag on Amazon and paid full price for it.  I enjoy being able to share my opinions and experiences with products to help other consumers in making informed purchasing decisions.",1
One more toy that lasted 5 minutes before my cats tired of it,0
The squirrels still get chased but not incessantly barked at.  Good product.,1
"Small and Toy dog owners BE AWARE! These were prescribed  for my 7.6 pound, 8  year old Chihuahua, I purchased 2 treats to start before ordering a whole box as she has thrown up other dental chews in the past. I thought the treats looked quite large for my little dog, so I chose to cut in half to see show she would do with it. She had the 1/2 and no problems. Finally on the way to better breath, or so I thought. She had to be boarded while we were out of town, so I sent the other 3 halves with instructions to give her 1/2 everyother day. The vet and boarding facility are linked, so I figured they would notice any issues.. We picked up our dog (8 years old an never sick from being boarded) and after 5 1/2 days being boarded and 8 days on the chews - she had the bright green diarrhea. The only place I can find this disgusting side effect is on the Amazon reviews. Thank you to those that reported it!  While searching for Oravet side effects, I also discovered my dog was given the wrong size, the small instead of the extra small - not good for a known reactor to vaccines. I called the vet and was given a few care instructions and told to call back if condition worsened. 3 days later and no more chews, my dog has light brown diarhhea and is vomiting blood, so I took her to a different vet for check up and she has a bacterial infection. The other dog we own was also boarded same time, same facilty -did not have the oravet chews and is not sick. I blame the chews and will not use. I'd like to know what an overdose of Delmopinol - the ingredient in these chews- does to dogs. There should be warnings on the packaging and provided to dog owners by the vet.
Additionally, I took my dog to a different vet for follow up and a staff member there offered the information that these chews will cause bright green poo and diarrhea. I think they wrecked havoc on my dog's digestive system.",0
"Dogs love them (they got a little crazy).  They remind me of a Slim Jim meat stick.  Ingredients are healthier than a Slim Jim, can't complain about anything on that list.  Nice dog treat.  We break them in half as dogs aren't sure the most efficient way to eat them when they are long and slim.",1
Lasted about 3 hours with my dogs and ripped to shred.,0
"I like it, but no easy way to turn it off in order to save battery life.  It does keep the dog from barking.",1
This is a very cost effective solution to preventing your back seat from getting stained from your pet. I would certainly recommended this product.,1
Very poor quality. I like the idea but is coming apart a week after installation.,0
nice product. My dog can not have any beef products so this isa god sub,1
"Been a month since we got it. Was easy to program, didn't have any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews pertaining to the resistance. Took our dog a few days to recognise the sound, but once he did - never have to worry about his meal or getting up early to feed him.",1
"I bought this for my cat because couldn't find the Purina Cat Chow Indoor formula. But i assumed it wouldnt be a big deal because its also a Purina product, but my cat refuses to eat it. She tried a lil bit and the small amount that she did eat made her throw up. I liked the price and the reviews from other cat owners, but regrettably i cannot continue to feed her something that makes her ill and that she refuses to touch.",0
I have tried this product for several weeks now and it does not work! I am so disappointed I was really excited to try this product out and this is not what I had thought :( my dog is a full breed boxer and she is so smart but she doesn't respond to this product training at all. I am terribly disappointed,0
Great Value--Quick Shipping!,1
Great while it lasts I have bought. Two in six months both have fallen apart.,0
Not for my dogs,0
Stopped working in a few months. should have listened to other reviews.,0
"Awful, don't waste your money",0
"The product had great reviews, and was very low priced, so I took a chance.  Poor quality.  Collar went off when other dogs barked (I have 5 dogs).  I guess the good reviews were not people with multiple dogs.  I worked with it to vary to sensitivity, but it still gave false corrections.  I had purchased 4 collars at the end of July and 3 of them have stopped working altogether.  Unfortunately I was too late to return them.  One of the poorest products I remember purchasing.  They were so bad, I would not advised buying anything from the store that sold them.  No reputable store should carry such a product.  the old adage is true:  Buy cheap, buy twice.  Stay away!",0
article of excellent quality,1
"If you read ingredient labels, you would know this is basically cheap by-products, calcium CARBONATE (chalk) and a bunch of additives, colors and preservatives. NOT a healthy diet for anyone interested in good nutrition for their pet. BUT...our 18+ tiny rescue mutt isn't long for this world and has taken a liking to this doggie junk food above all else. It was either cave in and buy it, or she was going to starve. But don't get your healthy young pet hooked on this slickly marketed product, designed by Mars to use up the waste products that aren't good enough for human consumption. There are much better choices that will provide better nutrition at the good pet specialty stores!",0
Sandy perches are the best! Natural wood perch with soft sand coating. Perch doesnt get cold like concrete ones do and very lightweight. They last years!,1
My 5 month puppy tore this thing to shreds the first two weeks I bought it,0
"This is great for our small dog to get up onto and out of our tall bed.  Looks nice, too.",1
"The only prob with these is that our springer-mix keeps hiding them! He loves how bouncy they are off the patio, trees, even the grass.",1
"I thought the scent was a good idea, but so did the dog. She chewed the thing into a hundred pieces in about 10 minutes! LOL
In fairness to the company, NO toy seems to be able to stand up to any Black Lab I have ever owned! BUT, when you pay this kind of money, you expect something a little more rugged.",0
Happy,1
"Very nice, sturdy Dog collar.  Goes well with the matching leash.  What can you say about a leash.  should last a long time.",1
"My two dogs (a Lab and an English Mastiff) just love it; their coats and energy reflect it. (The 4-out-of-5 thing is a subjective guess, but I'd bet on it.)",1
"This works so well, unless your dog steps on the buckle release and lets himself out. There isn't much they can do to fix that in the way of manufacturing so I don't hold it against them too much. Love the adjustable length, light, easy to carry and keep track of it. Great purchase!",1
Fits so perfect looks so cute,1
Its doable for a short time like photos.  I have an 18 pound skinny boston terrier/boxer mix and the large was tight.  The satin fabric also tore away from the black fabric on the back of the collar when I was putting it on the dog. My dog looked handsome wearing it though. :),0
"Does not work, ended up having to buy a different product.  What a waste of money!",0
I read the add wrong... Didn't realize it was a replacement,0
"Just to big, it's a piece of square material",0
"I really wanted this to work but it just didn't.  I gave this to my very energetic cat to see if I could calm him down so I could more easily trim his claws.  Yeah, it didn't do a thing.  On to the next idea.",0
"The heater worked well at first. Slowly over about 3 - 6 months the heater started producing bursts of burning plastic smell. Once we determined it was the heater we removed it only to find that the plastic had warped, cracked, and was leaking black grease into the water.",0
Easy to put together .,1
"The overall look and use of the cage is great BUT it is made from some really crappy plastic that is brittle and breaks.  All of the corners of the bottom plastic tray are broken and the shelf / shelf holder lasted about a week before they were cracked and broken too.

Very unfortunately as their customer service said that not covered under warranty and they sent me to their website for replacement parts - which totaled more a new replacement cage.  Well I am not good with a cage that costs $10 / month to own as it fall apart.

If you buy one, be aware the plastic they use is not very forgiving and they do not back up their product.",0
It simply didn't work.,0
Nice small treat for training.,1
Accidentally put my review for this product on another one.  This one isn't worth it. Will edit the other when I can access it again.,0
"These do the job, and the price is good.  They don't seem to tear or split, so I think they are a good choice.  I like that there are 20 bags to a roll.  A lot of the bags out there are only 15 to a roll, which means you have to change rolls more often, and you're more likely to run out while on a walk, and end up without a roll in a crappy situation.",1
These are a great size for smaller dogs. The product itself is great. I should have ordered a larger size for my pet.,1
Very very small,0
"I've purchased two of these belt leashes because I thought that the first one breaking after only a few uses was a fluke.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The same thing happened with the second leash.  The belt becomes a little slack, and the next thing you know, the entire thing loosens and fails to retract.  My dog is a Jack Russell terrier and weighs just 15 pounds, so there really is no excuse.  I have other, thin-cord, types of Flexi leashes and they hold up a whole lot better.  Maybe the folks at Flexi haven't perfected the technology of the retractable belt.  Hard to say, but I definitely won't buy another of these.",0
"We love these treats for training our dog or as a reward for doing her tricks.  They are really small, so we can give her a handful at a time without having to break them apart.  I like that they aren't overly rich, as our dog has a touchy tummy.",1
my cats hated it... but they're jerks. im sure a cat out there would love this stuff.  --- as a human--- I liked it.  dust free.,0
"This product did not work on my cats.  I am told that it has been around so long that the fleas have created a resistance to it, which I believe.  I put it on them just over one month ago and they continued to have live fleas on them. I couldn't put more product on them until one month had passed, so I continually vacuumed and laundered, which is exhausting and did little to help.  Finally, two days ago our Vet put Revolution Flea and tick for cats on them.  The fleas were dead in one day!  Wow.  What a relief.  The only reason I gave two stars rather than one is that I believe the amount of eggs actually decreased due to the ""Plus"", but it did nothing to kill live fleas.",0
"My wife was pushing a wipe back inside and her finger slipped and got stuck inside. The hard plastic teeth aren't bendable enough to allow you to free yourself. Had to get needle nose pliars and break/bend the tabs. After the ordeal her fingertip was purple from it pressing on her finger hard enough to cut circulation off. Could present a big hazard to children and adults. Oh yeah, didn't really help the dog stop being itchy.",0
easy to charge.  simple to adjust size.  very bright,1
Good Stuff. I stuff these in a kong and let the Pup work for the treat. Organ meat is also good nutrition.,1
It would be a great product if I had the other part to make it work. This is an accessory part only.,0
use it before using the clipper and after clipping,1
"I have several leashes but this is the one that I use the most.  It is perfect for walking my 25 pound dog around the neighborhood; it keeps him close enough to me so he is not able to lunge out into traffic due to the 6ft. length and because it retracts, it doesn't get caught-up under his legs.  It makes our walks in the evenings much more enjoyable. I just have to add that I ordered a second one for a dog I sometimes ""babysit"" and because this dog is smaller, I bought the smaller size leash (I purchased the medium for my dog). Both leashes are EXACTLY the same! Strange, but I use both nonetheless and am very happy with these leashes.",1
Sturdy and works well.,1
"Finally harnesses that fit our two dogs!  I have been trying different harnesses for years, and both the chihuahua and beagle could pull or step out of everyone of them, or  be subject to choking.  I love these harnesses!! And they are light weight and easy to clean!",1
Dos love this treat.,1
My grandson's snake had outgrown his previous hut.  He had checked at the local pet store and this one was 1/2 the price and a little bigger.  The snake is very happy.,1
This joint supplement has worked great for my OTTB turned eventer!,1
"Had to chuckle because my husband didn't read the instructions before using the liners.  It make more sense now and are working really
good.  He's always the one who says, ""Did you read the manual?""  Duh!!",1
My Dachshund loves these! The great part is that these last a long time unlike the regular CET chews. These keep my dog busy for quite some time!,1
"I have an extremely overactive and obnoxious pit bull pup, and I was hoping these would help at least a little. Even after giving him 4-5 times the amount for his weight, there was no difference at all. He still ran around like crazy and jumped on everyone.",0
Very good product will buy again in future.,1
It worked perfectly...the dogs were very comfortable...the people barely noticed we were traveling with dogs...very easy to store as well...,1
"Only thing I wish I would have seen where it said,  not for wire electric fence. Works great for plastic type wire.",1
"It makes kind of a sound.  Sometimes.  My dog ignores it.  The neighborhood dogs ignore it.  It's silent all right,  NOBODY can hear it.  Waste of money.",0
"When I first opened this, my only thought was ""what is THIS?""  I thought maybe it was some kind of replacement part for something I didn't have!  It turns out to be a remarkable simple toy that my cat really likes.  It was well worth the small price of $3-4 for it, which included free shipping.

I have it set up where my cat can use it by herself as I have anchored one end into something heavy.  She bounces all over the place with this thing.",1
"We replaced our plastic petsafe fountain with this one and couldn't be happier. This fountain is much better looking and you can't hear the motor vibrating at all like on the plastic one. The fountain does have a much louder water falling sound, but we find it relaxing and enjoy it.",1
"Received only partial order, inventory was wrong.",0
"As good or better quality than the last one I bought for $4.00. Heavy duty plastic, durable, reinforced  ribbing molded in. It is large to x-large in size, bigger than a cheap one I bought a few months ago at a discount store. A real bargain!",1
Received the pet taxi today and it didn't have a door in the packaging. Otherwise it looks fine but I can't use it in its current state!,0
20 minutes to destruction.,0
"its oil, enough said",1
"I had been buying the Purina One True Instinct Salmon dog food for my 2 dogs and they did fine with it. They seemed to like it better than any other dry dog food I had given them in the past. A couple of weeks ago, my husband purchased Purina One SmartBlend for Sensitive Systems by mistake. He thought it was the correct one because its first ingredient is salmon. Each of my dogs normally eats 1 to 1 1/2 cups of dry food per day. They have gone on strike!  Since getting this new food, they ""ask"" for food, and then ignore it for the whole day. Yesterday they ate 1/2 cup between them. The food remains sitting in their bowls from yesterday. I don't know if it could be rancid or what. I usually assume that when they get hungry enough, they will eat what I give them. But this is getting ridiculous!",0
"The small is INCREDIBLY small. I have a 14lb maltese/yorkie mix and it barely covered him. The stuff animal head itself also looks different than pictured. The color was darker, ears were smaller, had different hair and the eyes were plastic. Looked more like a bear than money",0
"Tried this little heater which claimed to be pre-set to 78 degrees. Wrong. I thought it would be perfect for my 1.5 gallon tank but the temperature is poorly controlled. In fact, it went to 85 degrees and was climbing which is too hot foe Betta Birdie. He's a tough little bastard and has survived a lot and I don't want him to end as fish soup. I'm switching back to my Elita heater for aquariums up to 5 gallons as it allows me to control the water temperature more accurately. This tiny heater which allowed for a more pleasing appearance is a disappointment. I ordered a 2nd one for a back up but I think I will be will be returning it.",0
the bars are melded together!!! you can not open it to add it to the pen I had!! the box got thrown out because it was left in the rain when delivered but that does not explain the factory melding the bars that slide out to the actual gate!!! I want a replacement ASAP. very disappointed. will not buy from this company again.,0
Excellent quality for finding freon leaks in hvac system,1
My dog won't eat anything else except fresh cooked chicken.,1
"As almost all reviews have stated, replacement covers are near impossible to get.  I called customer service and they told me of ONE place that has them (theuncommondog.com), BUT they want $42.67 for a large cover.  WTF?  I can replace the whole bed with the Kakadu brand (looks sturdier than the Coolaroo metal version) availableon Amazon for less than that.  Considering the regular large covers are $15.99, where do they get off charging 3 times that for the aluminum version replacement?  I will not buy a coolaroo product ever again.",0
I love how high the sides are - no litter gets pushed out! I would give 5 stars except for the way the bottom is made...there is a groove along the outer edge (inside). Any used litter that gets in that groove is very difficult to get out.,1
I can only go by what my doggies say and they are very enthusiastic about this treat.,1
"For what it is, the price is WAY too high!",0
Works amazing!!,1
Exactly like description. Great customer service.,1
So easy to use and makes my microfiber couch look freshly vacuumed. Id definitely recommend!,1
I have had this a month and my 12 week old lab was able to push the top open and break the zipper. The only reason I gave it two stars was because you can spray it off nicely.,0
these are working great..very sturdy...will buy again,1
"Washed my dog who does not suffer from allergies and the one who does, both were extremely itchy the next day until I bathed them again in their old shampoo.  This stuff had the opposite effect I had hope for.",0
A must have for puppy owners. Takes a beating and keeps on going. Dab of peanut butter inside and quiet time for you.,1
"1  DO NOT BUY THE HYPE!! it isn't what it claims to be. First of all they don't list ingredients on the product they only list the ""categories"" (???).  Doesn't that make anyone else suspicious other than me? He says in his videos that they don't use bleach or hydrogen peroxide yet it turned my fingers turn white (while they burned like hell even though a tiny bit of a drop got on them; and despite their disclaimer not to worry if your fingers turn white ... just rinse with soap and water they still burned for several minutes).  It's probably the same reason why my carpets are turning lighter and lighter where I sprayed his product as the weeks go on.

2 - It's not safe for pets!!! My cat had a severe reaction (per my vet) that made him turn hot red, small red bumps and he even had a slight fever!!!! He kept licking to probably try and get it off because I know 1st hand how much it burns. There's a disclaimer that says keep away from children but if your pet walks in it, they can get a severe allergic reaction as you can see from the pictures below. Plus it didn't stop them from marking in the same spots even if I was only treating a wall or ceramic floor ( FYI  marking is NOT a behavioral problem, it's a form of communication, as much as we may not like it. They do it even when they're fixed (males and females) and it's either to mark their territory, communicate if they're happy or unhappy, communicate if they want to mate with another cat if they are not fixed etc.

3 - With an excellent LED dark light, I saw his product turn a stain from yellow to blue. Why? Ironically perhaps  they say that blue is also a sign of a ursine stain (hmmm...since when?) is the steam not that their product turned the yellow steam to blow. Why would it turn it blue and why would I keep using the product if it's just going to make my carpets lighter or blue under an yellow steam to blow. Why would it turn blue and why would I keep using the product if it's just going to make it my carpets later lighter and not remove the stain?  Unfortunately it takes several weeks for your carpets to begin to discolor. And it's not just me... if you look at some of the good reviews (which shocks me why they would say it's a good review getting the stain out but having your carpets ruined in the process) isn't a good product in my opinion

4 - He says sometimes you have to use the product more than once on old stains or stains that you treated with another product. Very convenient but again I treated the stain multiple times and now I'm paying the price because I have light spots all over my carpets.

I just wish I put all the pieces together earlier and didn't ruin carpets in my house that were perfectly fine prior to using a product.",0
The dog loves them.,1
GREAT GROOMING PRODUCT VERY STURDY,1
Crap. Both collars quit working within a month.,0
Pups favorite toy.,1
This crate is sturdy and useful both at home and on the road and it's big enough for a plushy pet bed inside. Our little chihuahua loves it,1
"I love the vetri science products.
We ordered this over a year ago and finally just tried them with our dog.
We gave her the recommended amount for her weight and soon she started shaking uncontrollably.
Never ever had this happened before with other calming aids.
I don't know what it was about these ingredients but they had the OPPOSITE effect that lasted for hours....",0
Like other reviewers I couldn't even apply this because of the way the thick paste came out of the syringe. Wasted half the tube. I'm a nurse and thought the syringe would be more convenient than the 2-step brush method...NOT.,0
"This is a total cheap plastic piece of junk that might as well not even have moving parts. If you have some kind of grooming task that involves cutting ONE HAIR AT A TIME maybe it would work for that, otherwise you could just save yourself some time by going at throwing $10 out the window.",0
"We bought this for a 40 pound dog and the leash snapped within a few weeks. Our dog wasn't even pulling very intensely when it broke which is pretty disappointing how little it took to break. I would not trust this product to be used with a 110 pound dog as the description states it is rated for or with a dog with poor recall, could cause a lot of issues for owner and dog alike.",0
"This item did nothing to help the smell. In fact, it wouldn't even stay in place.
It was a waste of money. Don't bother..",0
"Our two MinPins love these treats, and I love the quality.  Bet your dog would love them too, well worth the price.",1
Works but you need to follow the directions. First batch was 3 hatched out of 20 (our fault). Consecutive hatches yielded 16-18 out of 22-24 eggs. Humidity control is a must for the owner to follow or you will be disappointed. easy to clean and disinfect Only drawback is that is hard to take the fan shroud off to clean it.,1
This works pretty good.,1
Difficult to see where the actual cut will be. I was afraid of cutting into the quick and will continue to use people nail clippers.,0
Purchased new but somehow received used shaver.  Shaver was in on position when I received it so I decided to do a complete investigation.  Results were product was cleaned and oiled but I found find fine hair inside the base of the blades.  Products was repackaged as new but has bee opened and used.  Deceptive and Unacceptable.,0
The concept is great but it fits the SMALLEST litter pan. My cats missed the box and peed all over the inside of the cabinet. It leaked through and I couldn't get the smell out. Had to throw it away after just one week. BAD INVESTMENT!,0
"He loves them so much, in fact, that one day when my boyfriend and I were out, he broke into his dog treats drawer and ate an entire bag of Greenies. Needless to say, we've moved the drawer into the garage.

Every morning I'll break off a whole piece into halves and feed him one half in the morning and one half at night. It seems to help with his doggie breath, though I don't know how much it's helped with his plaque.",1
"I bought two of these. Unfortunately, each one broke after only two uses. Essentially, on throwing the ball, the rubber plug dislodged when it landed. The plug seemed tight and that's why I replaced the first ball, thinking it was perhaps a fluke. Unfortunately, the same thing then happened again. And of course, with it being dark, I couldn't find the missing plug either time. I really wanted this to work as my shepherd loved it but I'm now going to see what else is out there.",0
"-- Look and feel is of raw unfinished leather. I like the raw/natural color of the line.

-- Sharp All 4 edges of the line are sharp and run the entire 33' length. There is no doubt my hands will be cut during break-in, but not severely enough to warrant a return.

-- Multiple stiff kinks/curves in the line that vary between 30 and 90 degrees.  I expect these to resolve once the line is broken-in.  In the interim there are two issues that arise: 1) decreased fluidity of the line increases the risk of dog entanglement through obstacles or brush and 2) these are the points I'm likely to incur cuts or abrasions when applying pressure to the line, for example while braking a dog who suddenly sees a squirrel.

-- The clasp is solid brass and is clearly of high quality.  However it is more ""elegant"" than ""beefy.""  Compared to 2 other lines that I own, this clasp is about 70% as robust as the one included with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OmniPet-40-Check-Cord-Orange-Black/dp/B009VBU3SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OmniPet 40' Check Cord, Orange/Black</a>&nbsp;and about about 85% as substantial as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SportDOG-Orange-Check-Cord-30-Foot/dp/B001F0IJ9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SportDOG Orange Check Cord - 30-Foot</a>.  For this reason, I prefer this clasp over the others because none of them are going to come anywhere near breaking with my dog (40-50lbs) while making for a much more streamlined attachment point.

-- This has a handle.  This increases the risk of entanglement if the line is used as a line dragged behind the dog (tracking, hunting uses).  Some may prefer this because it allows the leash to be used in a more traditional way.  My dog isn't strong enough for me to need a handle to hold him back and I have seen dogs get tangled in loops.  I would have preferred a line without a handle because it's retail cost would have been cheaper; then again, it's already cheap and I can just cut it off myself.

Bottom Line:

This is an inexpensive product made of high quality raw materials. Its unfinished nature limits its usefulness and places the user at risk for mild injury until break-in occurs.",0
Good buy!,1
My amazons are really enjoying these sneakers.,1
"I thought Kong toys were durable, but not this one!  Maeve (a 15 pound Westie) destroyed it within 30 minutes. Definitely would not recommend.",0
"This is the second unit that we have purchased.  We had the first for years before the electric unit went out so we bought what we thought was the same unit but the cat won't get in it?  With the temp being in the -29 to -30's yo'd think she would crawl in---no go?
  Jim and Yvonne",0
These are perfect for my shorkie. He loved the squeaker and I love the fact that eventually if he does rip them apart there is no stuffing to clean up.,1
"My two dachshund love these fat free treats.

I discovered them a couple of years ago when one of my 'kids' came down with pancreatitis.  This condition requires minimal fat in the diet and most treats on the market are full of fat.

If you know dachshunds you know they love their treats, and when we could no longer reward them they became noticeably depressed. Thank goodness I discovered K-9 Fat Free Treats... my dogs actually love them better then off the shelf snacks, and I love them because I know they are made with all natural ingredients.",1
Reasonable price and does the job.,1
"They don't last long at all just days to maybe weeks sometimes. You get what you pay for I guess, I will stick to real name brands.",0
"Like the food, but packaging is really awful.",0
It works as advertised.  It did take about 12 weeks to get; it must have shipped directly from Hong Kong.,1
Not good for my dogs,0
The measurements in this are wrong. My dog had to wear the small because there's no xsmall available. It was too big for her and she couldn't walk right because the boobs were too big! Needs to put the right measurements!,1
It works! Litter traps successfully in the mat and doesn't get distributed through the house :),1
"Everything was great except that the filling is the kind that crushes down but each section is machine washable and fluffs up again, of course with a 160lb.s of dog, I'll be doing it more often than I would have hoped. Still awesome size and materials appear to be durable.",1
"My bulldog ripped the top apart and swallowed two pieces in no time flat.

Took about a month for the first piece to come out and I was surprised at how hard the plastic had become, and how sharp the edges were. A few weeks later, he threw the other piece up. Same thing, hard rubber with very sharp edges.
I'm guessing the acid in the stomach changed the consistency of the rubber.

Either way, if you have tough chewers just pass on this toy. Much better options out there.",0
"This unscented dog shampoo is better than what I expected.  I've been using other scented Nature's Miracle Supreme Odor shampoo for my dog since she was born, which is over two years and it's been good.  It does give nice shinny skin but my dog has extremely dry skin on winter season so I do mix one table spoon of coconut oil  with the shampoo to help her with extremely dry skin.  Also, she is losing less hair this way.
P.S.  She is 14lbs dog so if you have bigger dog with dry skin, you might want to add more coconut oil with the shampoo.",1
So far it seems to work just fine on dog hair in my cars.,1
The dress runs extremely small. I ordered a medium and it's more like an extra small. I was extremely disappointed because I waited a whole month just to return the item.,0
My cat has probably went through 3-4 other collars that she has been able to wrangle off or just popped off themselves. But not this one! The clasp works great and the collar itself is very cute.,1
"This fits perfectly in a crate. I crate my dogs and this is the reason why they love to sleep in their beds while I'm out of the house. It's comfy; easy to clean and wash!

IMPORTANT: Wash on COLD GENTLE cycle and just tumble dry this on NO or LOW HEAT for a few minutes or else the fabric frays and gets crusty.",1
"I ordered this product and I came quickly that's the reason for 2 stars. On the description on this cage said the bar spacing was .5 an inch. After assembly, I measured the bar spacing and it was 1 inch. I bought two ratties, and the first thing the did was ex cape through the baring. I have a to put extra wiring on the cage, which makes it look ghetto as all hell. I'm so upset that I have had to fix a problem that should have to fix in the 1s place. Any idea where I can get an ""actually get a rat cage. Because I just love spending money I don't have, because the manufacture lied.",0
"The jacket is very attractive, but in less than two months of using it the zipper has separated away from the jacket and can no longer be used.....very cheap mechanism!",0
"Has a great smell and makes good suds.  My dog has sensitive skin and developed bumps with other products, but so far this is having no ill effects.  Her fur was very soft and felt rich after the first bath.",1
"I feel this is pretty pricey for not getting better result. I bought MSM, & Glucosamine at health food store & the dog is getting around much better than she did on Silver Lining",0
"measurements given are incorrect, so no I'm stuck with a harness that's much too small. Spent a lot of money for nothing since shipping it back from outside the country costs more than the item itself",0
Good Results! Very happy with the outcome! Glad that I was able to get this product and test it! Thanks for an amazing product!,1
"These are great for training and you don't have to worry about giving your pup more than one! Plus, love that they are all natural and made in the USA.",1
I have not had this very long and the charger isn't working and hasn't for quite some time. I have asked the company to contact me and they still haven't. I will be trying to call on Monday because what use is a collar that will not charge?,0
Does a good job.,1
do not buy from Amazon!! the freeze dried kibble was broken up into millions of pieces....maybe from shipping but regardless....my dog won't eat it now I am out $20 cause I threw the bag out after I dumped it into her food container.,0
Was as advertised,1
Works great!,1
This is her new favorite chew toy.,1
Didn't notice that it did any good.,0
"I have a German Shepherd/lab mix and a Maine coon who both shed like crazy. With the first brushing, handfuls of hair came off both of them! And as an added bonus they both loved it. My husband told me to buy a couple more and give them to friends and family. Amazing product!",1
"It's definitely a durable toy. Keep in mind that it's still going to get ripped up (eventually) if you have a strong breed. I've got a Siberian husky/white German shepherd mix, and he can go through one of these in a week. A week, though, is actually a lot longer than most other toys. Still, after all the pulling apart and shredding, enough is still intact that he plays fetch and carries it around everywhere still. As these dragons seem to be his most favorite of toys, I have about five of various sizes and colors laying around the house.

I recommend non-aggressive (towards toys) and/or medium-sized dogs and smaller to have these toys if you want something that'll last a long time. My mother has two Shetland sheepdogs that loved their large dragon, but they never could tear it up. Beagles, pugs, Boston terriers that played with the same one (visiting the house) also didn't rip through it. You be the judge, though; you know your dog better than anyone else.",1
My dog !s favorite--even if it goes thro the washing machine!,1
Bottle kind of small but my dog easily drank out of it on a recent walk,1
Great Product; Great Service,1
"My labs cant get enough of these, I just wish they would last longer. Out of all the toys they have they tend to go to these the most. I guess it has to do with the texture or something because non of the others satisfy them the same.",1
nice!,1
Sizing isn't even close. I have to return it..,0
"Greenies are a must in our household. Our dog knows 8:00PM is Greenie snack time. She sits patiently at our feet near the 8:00 time, hoping and waiting for her favorite snack. And, I like that they freshen breath and clean teeth.",1
Smelly...dog hates it.,0
good quality,1
"Unbelievably poor quality. A piece of wood with a couple of screws hastily shoved into the sides, which fell out of the holes as I tried to put it in the cage. Worth no more than $2. My parrot has already chewed it up, it lasted for 2 weeks.",0
"This works pretty well on my Cocker Spaniels ears, keeps him out of the vet's office. The vet however does not approve of using ear washes so I will not reorder.",1
The only food my pup will eat that won't mess with his stomach!,1
"It's a fair price for this specialty dog food and my senior dog loves it! I have to keep her as lean as possible with an injury she has to her leg, and this dog food has been perfect. I don't need to feed her as much, so while I'm keeping calories down to watch her weight, I know she's getting the nutrients she needs as a senior dog, too.",1
"My small dog loved these toys, but shredded the fabric parts very quickly. The knots came off in his mouth and had to be fished out. It's a little freaky to give your dog a chew toy that basically disintegrates. If you choose these, please supervise your pet so s/he doesn't choke!",0
"This product was advertised as durable, for large dogs, etc.  My 10 month old St. Bernard chewed the end off within an hour!  We had purchased another brand of firehose toy and that one lasted 5 months.  We are very disappointed with the quality.",0
"I have had this litter box for the last three years, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a private space for kitty to do their business.  I keep mine in the floor of the closet and have not had any problems.  About 2x per year I take it outside & clean it really well with the hose.

I do keep a rug underneath because if you use clumping litter it can track out and down the little ramp.  I also stopped using the filters in the vent and just keep an air freshener plugged in the closet.

If for some reason you don't get the lid completely on, there could be some unfortunate leakage at the seam.

All in all great box with many options.",1
"I have been looking for eco friendly. I tried the ghastly smelling lavender bags because they were eco friendly Poop and could not tolerate the smell.
Finally the Poop Bags by two (not just one) vets are available.  They work well in 0 degree weather in New Hampshire, do not break in your pocket, and are large enough for a Wheaten Terrier.  Just one of life's little issues solved. I am grateful, the dog doesn't care.",1
Works as stated.,1
My Netherland Dwarf did not like this. :(,0
"This arrived USED AND DIRTY!! It was sealed in a 'READY TO SHIP' envelope but covered in short fur, with soiling near the tail hole, and a slice through the brand label. I bought this to safely carry my unvaccinated puppy in and now I've brought some dog's germs into my home, which could prove deadly to my pup, since I let him help me open the package.",0
My dog had hot spots from Cancer meds the last month of her life. I hated the traditional E collar and so did she. I kept looking for something better and found this. It arrived a week before she died. It was so much better and worked. Her hot spots were on both sides of her mid sections. She was unable to get to them with this collar on. I recommend this collar.  Make sure you measure properly before ordering.  GREAT Product.,1
aWESOME!,1
"My 2 small dogs LOVE these ""chicken chips"" as we call them, and just like humans, can't stop at just one! Safe ingredients, an ample amount of product for the price, and a quality company. Will definitely be buying more.",1
My puppy has had some ear problems lately and I could not afford to buy some expensive cleanser from the vet. I searched and found this cleanser and I'm happy with the results. Does what it says! My puppy didn't even complain while I was putting it in his ears (a miracle since he has always struggled!). I highly recommend this product.,1
"our dog goes crazy over these toys, loves to play tag with us with them!",1
The white part is the tough Nylabone normal stuff. The red part started splintering and breaking off in chunks in about a day and we had to toss the bone out.,0
"The main reason I tried this unit was the price. It was much cheaper than any other and still highly rated so I was quite surprised when I got it and the remote was annoying to set the intensity and the collar broke on day 2. No matter what number the remote says it barely shocks at all and it never vibrates either. I tried it on my hand at all settlings and no change. The range was amazing for such a cheap unit but only while it worked. Oh and it never got wet, not even rain so that couldn't have been the issue.

Edit: changed to one star after not receiving a refund or any response over a month after sending it back.",0
Perfect for my cat good price but the directions were incomplete. They only have u a list of  what u should have but no way to assemble it. I went off the picture on amazon...,0
Works great!,1
"First, note: this $150 feeder does NOT come with the 4 C-cell batteries you need to use it. Dear Amazon, that would be a more useful ""people also bought"" suggestion than the colored accessories, since I now have to make an extra trip to the store.

(Updated after 2 weeks of use:) Once working, the feeder has been great. Getting a cat's chip registered was easy. The training mode is great to get the cat used to the moving flap and its sound. (Though during the training phase the other cats will be able to get into the feeder...) The feeder is nicely made.",1
"Much more palatable than other brands, my dog didn't turn his nose up at this one!",1
I just received this in the mail today and it had no collar or shock electrodes. Sending it back,0
"""Safety light were better than expected, Perfect for our Lab and Chi. It is impressive when the vendor contacts me prior to delivery indicating to reply to the email if I have any questions or concerns.""",1
My dog loves it,1
Didn't work as well as I'd hoped.  Still seeing fleas on our cat a week after applying the product.,0
"Nice smell, easy to use.  good subs.  No allergic reactions.",1
"I would not recommend this for large dogs. I originally used it as deterrent. When I finally broke down and used it to prevent my dog from licking her paws, she almost immediately cracked the plastic portion of the shielding.

After 4 days of continuously wearing the device, it definitely looks the worse for wear. The plastic shielding is cracked and missing chunks. Her ears seem warmer, causing her to scratch more. It seemed like a good idea, but I don't think it holds up to larger breeds.

Smaller dogs may not cause as much damage. The convenience of the three rows of Velcro make it convenient to take off allowing my dog to eat and get water and then replace.

Ultimately it is doing the job it was designed for. Even with the holes, but I expected to place this somewhere and not be able to find it. Maybe a year later needing it again, only to realize I have no clue where it is and buy a new one the next time she gets a splinter. Now I know this is going straight in the trash and I may have to buy a replacement prior to that.

If you have a small dog you should be fine, but larger dogs will rip the plastic shielding. I write this as an owner of a Rottweiler. It seemed it would be cost effective, if I had a smaller dog I don't think I would worry about buying this product. Unfortunately that is not the case and I may end up going with the the overpriced vet stuff next time.",0
"I thought it would be a great idea.  I especially liked that I could put my cat in there to give her medicine.  Well my cat does not act like the one in the video.  She might go in peacefully, but trying to give her medicine while in the bag was nearly impossible.  My other cat who is typically pretty mellow, refused to go in it completely.

I'm glad it's an option for some cats, but for mine it wasn't.",0
This made my dogs throw up. Terrible product.,0
I have 6 cats and they will not eat these. Shipping and everything else was good.,0
"Doesn't work very well.  There's nothing to trap the litter, so this acts about the same as if you put a piece of wood under the box.  We went with a litter trapping mat instead, and we're happier with that.",0
"This is great in theory,  however my dog was able to solve the puzzle within 10 minutes.",0
"The two blades get stuck on each other. Loosening and tightening the screw doesn't help... it is either too loose and snags, or too tight and you can't open/close them. There is no inbetween. Plus if you try and inbetween, the screw just gets looser as it is used, and you have to keep adjusting.",0
Good filter socks,1
My cat really likes these little soups. He always asks to get them by rubbing against them and I give him more than I should. They smell kinda good and look like real food.,1

"I'm a huge fan of KONG toys. As a rescuer we have many dogs coming in and out and when I find a safe, durablet toy I stock up. My personal dogs love it too.",1
I have bought three of these.  Why?  Because my relatives see them in use and want one.  The leash is great in crowded events.  It is comfortable in guiding the dogs to heel in stressful situations.  Use it on my 55 strong Shar pei and 60 pound Afghan hound,1
Loved it and she healed well from her surgery without getting to incision,0
"I had high hopes that this would work. I bought 2 sizes, this item is the larger size, which I gave away, so I really only know about the smaller size 2 . On that smaller size it  has a loop where you put your dog collar through it to make sure it stays on. The loop was not large enough for my 1 inch wide dog collar, so I could not use that feature. That being said, I put it on, & in less than a minute my dog was wearing it under her chin. Maybe I did something wrong?",0
I purchased one of these from Walmart and they are not worth the money. They would work great if the motor was stronger. The motor has no power to grind the nails. VERY easly bogged down.,0
Excellent product - happy that the bags decompose as well.  Have re-ordered,1
Dont like it,0
Received the product quickly They work great. I don't have any problem with them coming out of the windows when I roll them up or down (2014 Ram 1500) or flapping when the windows are open. They are a bit big for the crew cab rear doors but not a big deal.,1
Great idea! It worked the 1st time my dog stepped on it. She did not need a 2nd time. Wonderful product.,1
"Oh god, my dog looks so goofy and adorable in this. It also does a pretty good job of keeping her mostly dry.",1
"Very small - look for longer handle - pretty flimsy plastic.
Found MUCH better option at Walmart (not sure if online is option) and was only $3.22.",0
"The pump works great. And such power from even a smaller size. Easy to attach any where in the tank, even if wanting to move it to another location.",1
I doesn't work.  I wish i had my money back. Ive changed batteries 2 times.,0
"Easy to use and is fitted to seat
  I had another brand which had no shape and
 did not function as well. This cover is more heavy duty and padded. Very pleased with it so far. I bought a second one for my other car",1
"My cat played with it once and got bored. I bought a three pack. I don't think the catnip was very potent. He usually loves these kind of toys. I wonder if there was a bad batch as another reviewer just posted something similar.

Update - I noticed that four other reviewers recently (in the last two months Sept and Oct) posted a somewhat similar experience. I just contacted Amazon and advised them the preceding and the other users posts. I bought from the seller Deals On Call. Amazon said they would pull the Deals On Call product from the web site and investigate the issue and the product from them. I don't know if it's a problem with a particular reseller's products or multiple resellers. I hope Amazon will find out.

Amazon gave me a free return label as it seems my product was defective.",0
"I ordered the smallest size advertised but when I received vest on label I see they have three smaller sizes which would have fit my dog much better. Otherwise, great product.",0
"Too flimsy. Won't stay on my dog when she shakes or scratches herself. Collar too thin  not durable at all. If we put the collar and the leash on our dog, it comes off by pulling.",0
Purchased these after seeing how unhealthy the treats we were giving her were.  Took her a little bit to get used to but she likes them now.,1
This food killed my 2 German Shepherds within 3 months of each other ...seizures and liver failure ...my French bulldog suffered from severe lethargy and could not even go on a short walk with out falling over...she was also constantly licking her feet from itching...after my Shepherds died I did some research online and found many people having same problems with their dogs that ate Beneful...I stopped feeding my Frenchie this food and within days her energy came back and she has completely stopped her paw licking,0
Did not work. Cat ignored it,0
I love how it's made. Cleans well. I would tell anyone to try the mat. They on't be sorry,1
"Straight to the point-
This dog run is very well made-
It is made with heavy duty hardware designed to last-
It can be quite difficult to install yourself if your using the entire length of the run and placing it 12ft off the ground-
If you have normal active dogs like I do then the leads will eventually get tangled from time to time-
At the end of the day it's a great dog run and probably the best you will find available in today's market.",1
"Fantastic toy for STRONG chewers.
I haven't used these before ( I buy a lot of these NYLABONE toys to donate to the local SPCA ) so I was t sure how the dogs would like the shape. So far they haven't gone for them the way they like the WISHBONE shape but this style does look practically indestructible and at a good price. TIP: smear a bit of Peanut Butter on your NYLABONES to get the dog interested",1
"This dog food has healthy ingredients and it agrees with my female Havanese. She is doing well on it and has firm stools - which has not always been the case with some other dry foods I tried, including Wellness small breed. The only drawback I can see is that she doesn't seem to love the taste. She is somewhat finicky and occasionally skips a meal. I would give it 5 stars if the favor could be improved a little.",1
"Awesome product, comes in handy when you need power for your phone, etc.",1
Our birds love these.,1
Bigger than expected for model I have.  Had to trim.  Carbon filter is not what I expected probably just black sponge material.  Shipping very slow for amazon.,0
"I'd been buying this brand in my local pet food store, but driving to the store, lifting the heavy bag into the cart, then into the car, and then dragging it into the house from my car was not so much fun (I'm a single, middle-aged woman with no one to help me with heavy lifting around the house!)

So, Amazon Prime to the rescue--UPS does all the heavy lifting for me and the food arrives on my front door step.  Problem solved!!!!",1
"the item was used and sticky upon arrival - I did NOT dare giving it to my puppy because she is not yet vaccinated. Used and dirty items, which don't get clean even after washing them should really not be send out to customers.",0
"I have been using Clump & Seal for about 2 months now. I purchased two more boxes of the product after using my sample box. This is how happy I am with this cat litter. I have had cats, off and on, for over 20 years. I have never had a cat litter work this well. I don't see myself switching to a different product ever.",1
We bought this for a kitten to keep him from climbing and clawing the furniture! Well it worked for that purpose but within a few weeks he has knocked off the smaller watch tower. We have tried repairing it with metal washers and it still falls off. It is made with a cheap cardboard inside and the hole has gotten too large to repair anymore! The rest of the tower seems sturdy but this was our kitten's favorite hangout! He only weighs 4.5 pounds so he is a tiny cat! It should not have come off so easily! :(,0
I have a 4 pound yorkie and it is difficult to find clothes that fit correctly. This is perfect!,1
"Came damaged but too bulky to bother returning. Was pictured with Littermaid box in it, box does fit, however when the automatic scoop goes, it will push open door. Needs about 2more inches of length. Very misleading.",0
Love these. Got the biggest size and they are awsome. Even though we got two they insist on sharing one.,1
"Dog didn't get this, and he's a pretty smart dog",0
My Dog loves it....it is well worth it to keep my dog happy. We switched from a normal rawhide to the Dingo natural,1
Horrible...Doesn't really get as much fur out as it says it does.,0
"These are really great quality toy mice - the rabbit fur and leather tail are particularly nice touches. My cat loves to chew the tails off her toy mice, so having something ""natural"" (and therefore, more readily digestible) was critical in choosing this product. They have a good bounce when you toss them, which my cat also loves. She chases them all over.

My only complaint is that she loves them so much that I find them all over the apartment - and startle myself briefly, thinking I've seen a real mouse.

Definitely worth it for the price.",1
"Fits perfect, looks great, doesn't rub under the arms, easy to put on, Love it!",1
"I bought one of these beds at my local Petco store for my 13 pound Chihuahua mix, then decided to check reviews on Amazon. I found the same bed in a different color being sold on Amazon by Petco for $20 less than I paid at the store. Without even reading reviews of the bed on Amazon, I knew I had to buy a second bed for my other, 20 pound terrier mix, since both dogs were scrambling to use the bed, even though I had just bought a crate bed, which both dogs sleep on. In short, the dogs love the bed, it looks good in both the Chili/taupe color and Celadon/taupe color, seems to be made well and is reversible for warmer and cooler weather. Very pleased with the purchase, especially for the one I got on Amazon at the much lower price.",1
Best thing yet. My puppy  loves this thing. Had to buy him more! He just forgot all his other toys and wants this to go everywhere he goes! So funny!,1
Cats love it,1
"Gets rid of fleas, but scary to use on pets.
I did not want to use Frontline because it can have bad side effects on some animals, but the flea collars were useless this year where there is a bad flea infestation in my area. So, I had to break out the toxic stuff.
I was very careful with this product. I have 3 cats, 2 were fine. One cat, Sultan lost fur and got sore/itchy skin where I placed the Frontline.  I purposely put the product carefully on a small section of skin on all 3 cats, using 1 tube between 3 cats, because Frontline has reviews showing this problem.  I monitored them all carefully after putting it on.  2 of the kitties had no reaction. When I saw Sultan's skin reacting, I was ready with an OTC ointment called Bag Balm, which soothed and cleared the skin. Frontline absolutely works on the fleas, along with flea combing, vacuuming, and washing bedding. I will continue to use it, have to get rid of the fleas.  The fleas cause more problems to Sultan's skin than the rash, so Frontline is the ""lesser evil"" for him.

Something creepy is happening with the flea population - I grew up with pets, the flea collars used to be enough.  This year, fleas were making nests under the collars by the time I saw itching. These fleas - are seriously super fleas. A whole, miles long section of our city has an infestation, the vets are swamped with it.  Something needs to be done to destroy the flea population, the next level of Frontline is going to kill the pets before it kills the fleas!",1
"Dog loves it. He has hip troubles and is older. He seems to sleep more comfortably on this bed.
It is big enough (med size Beagle mix around 50 lbs) for him to stretch out. The cats can even join him without disturbing him.
I would purchase this item again.",1
Gems fell off within less than 48 hours of wear.,0
"Neither of my puppies really liked this flavor of treat. They prefer either the Chicken or Salmon. These were also much harder to chew than the other flavors (the others are softer). I don't know if it was just an ""old"" bag of treats or the consistency of the Rabbit flavor, since the bags are well-sealed. I won't buy this flavor again, though.",0
"I purchased this heater with high expectations as Eheim is (was?) one of the higher quality manufacturers of aquarium supplies. However, I must now say I will not purchase another Eheim product as the heater was defective and, while manufacturing defects do happen, the attitude I received from tech support was the final straw.

This heater allows for recalibration if the temperature of the water in the tank does not match the temperature at which the heater is set. After having the heater in the tank 24 hours, the water temperature was much higher than the setting so I followed the directions for recalibration. After several days of adjustments, the recalibration ring was set as far as it would go, the temperature ring was set at 75 degrees and, the unanimous reading of the 3 different types of thermometers was still 79.8. While I can continue to set the temperature lower to reach the desired 78 degrees, the accuracy of this heater should not be that far off and I question its reliability.  One nice thing about this heater is, as far as precision is concerned, when it settles on a temperature (right or wrong) it does hold to the tenth of a degree.

I recently emailed Eheim expressing my concerns regarding the lack of accuracy and requested a replacement heater considering I was only a couple months into a 3-year warranty. The response I received was to restore the heater to factory settings for 24 hours then let them know what the temperature was.  Since the temperature was already running higher than set, returning the heater to factory settings would put the water temperature in the high 80s - low 90s. Not wanting to kill my fish (including a 14-year old clown loach and 3 near hand-sized angel fish), I called tech support this morning and got absolutely no where. As per the rep, they won't honor their warranty if I don't reset the heater to factory settings and verify the temperature yet they aren't about to replace my fish. As I do not have a back up heater, testing the Eheim in a bucket is not an option, neither is returning it to them for verification. The rep I spoke with was rude, unapologetic and refused to let me speak to a supervisor as he said I had no reason. Fortunately, Amazon came through and offered to refund my money. Between the lack of accuracy of the heater and, even more so,  the complete lack of customer service, the new heater will NOT be an Eheim!",0
Order a pack on prime day for the deal. It arrived yesterday it was filled normally just like how a bag would be if I bought it from Sams. My dog loves these!,1
"It's a little flimsy and a little small. When I first purchased this it held together alright, but it began to frequently collapse and now it is worn out after less than two months of use.",0
Most of the shrimp cubes were more like dust. Wouldn't recommend this product. You're better off buying frozen.,0
Worked great but had issues with it not turning on after a year. However they gave us a discount on replacement since warranty was up.,1
Our mini Schnuzar had a chew guard toy given to her.  This sherpa one the squeeze noise was gone in two day. The other had given out after 7 month not worth the money.,0
"Product stopped working one month outside of the return window. Had a rattle on day 1 but still worked for a couple months, but lost all functionality after 4 months. Not happy that I can't return this.",0
"GREAT FOR TAKING PULL OUT OF THE WALK....MAKE HANDLING EASIER....BRIGHT, DURABLE & WASHES EASY!",1
The rubber part pops off every time my dog struggles. Not worth it.,0
This product is something I have used in combination with Magnesium 5000 to help calm a nervous Arabian.  This is a Thamine supplement.... B1 Vitamin... that is part of the daily feed routine. I add one scoop of this along with two scoops of the Mag 5000 to the 2 lbs of grain in the morning.  I appreciate that this is now available via Amazon Prime - shopping is simple.,1
Way too small....And told a month and a half to get !!!!! Very bad,0
they are a lot thinner than i thought. My 14lb boston terrier dachshund mix eats most of them within 5 minutes. I think there was about 2 in the bag that were thick enough to last him an hour or so. Also they have a pretty intense odor.,0
"I hate to be a negative ninny but contacting the creator of these toys is quite difficult.  Therefore, I need to place a comment here.  I backed this project on Kickstarter believing these toys would be ""catnip infused"", and with five cats, was quite excited.  When they arrived and placed them on the floor, n-o-t-h-i-n-g.  The cats totally ignored each and every one.  If there is catnip involved, my toys didn't get any. Quality control?  I have no idea.  The toys are well made and appear durable.  Catnip infused?  Not mine.",0
"Comments said 2 cats could fit in it. My 10lb. dog cannot fit in it. Its tiny. Whats worse is that it came from China and took 2 wks. to arrive. No return labels, no papers at all. Post office having hard time in finding city or province address for return and said it would cost more to return than price of bed. Ad never said it would come from China!  Just heard from the P.O. She called me to say it would cost me $81.00 to return it to China.  Boy, was I stupid to deal with FFMODE. Will donate it.",0
Easy to use and no egg withdrawal! Gives me peace of mind that my ladies aren't wormy and keeps them healthy and happy!,1
"It's not that great, exterior falls apart fairly easy with moderate chewing and the treat center does not last very long at all. I was planning on using it to keep occupied while they were in their crates but they can eat a whole treat center in about 2 1/2 hours which leads to diarrhea from all the fat. Won't buy again.",0
"I have a Tibetan terrier mix who was matted in so many different places, it was pretty clear when he went to the groomer they would have to shave him. I had vowed never to let that happen again, but here we were! After many painstaking hours (and painful ones for him), in a last ditch effort I bought this. Used in combination with a detangling spray (which I had never tried before) this made the job almost easy. If you have a dog with a heavy undercoat, get this - you and your dog will thank yourself forever.",1
The one I received was a totally different color than the one I received. On the website it showed light blue and I got a white and royal stripped pattern. Also the inside floor was animal print vs. blue in the picture. Most importantly it smelled musty.,0
"I'm very pleased with this purchase. I was shopping the different pet supply stores looking for a sturdy and functional cat tree and just wasn't happy with what I was finding - and at such high prices! A friend recommended this brand. Amazon is my go-to source as they have great selections and shipping is quick! It was easy to put together, the kittens that I'm fostering love it and it is sturdy enough for the large grown kitties.
The added bonus is that it is attractive and a nice addition to the living room. I often get comments on how nice it looks.
One additional note when shopping for a kitty scratching tree - make sure the poles are wrapped in the twine rope. The cats are drawn to it and it is much more substantial than carpeting alone. All carpeting scratching posts usually mean a lot of carpet bits all over your floor :-)",1
I bought 3 of these and gave one as a gift! Dachshund proof!! Love it,1
"This is definitely a mini. G.I.Joe size, I bought this for my grandson as he has different military costume camouflage and would like a small tent to play in. Had the tent delivered to his home, many states away. I was very disappointed to discover it was a doll tent, not kid size. He is only 4 and was even more disappointed than me.",0
"Purchased these after our 3 year old Cardigan Welsh Corgi started scratching and itching all the time due to the super hot and dry summer.  After administering the entire bottle, he then developed hot spots and now I have to take him to the vet.  Very disappointed :(",0
defiantly buy re-chargeable batteries when you buy this.  it eats batteries like nobodies business.  I think it's cheaply made and with my dogs hair type (course and thick) it doesn't shock him unless he's laying down.,0
Helps with plaque/tartar. Highly recommemd it!,1
My 14 year old dog looses her hind legs and this is a great product that I can catch her before she falls.  And if she does fall it is a lot easier to pick her up,1
My puppies love these!,1
Very cheaply made for price!!,0
A little thin and I thought it was larger.,0
"The motor has not burned out yet, so that's a plus. Fairly quiet.",1
"I bought this to replace a similar waterer that I'd bought years ago and loved. Let's face it, changing a five-gallon water bottle is never a pretty sight. But the previous version's bottle was more like a water cooler bottle, and much, much easier to handle. The bowl piece is also really flimsy. The first time I attempted to replace the bottle, the whole top piece popped off. But hey, that floor needed to be mopped, right? Very poor design, especially for the money.",0
Wonderful,1
Did not work at all for my three cats.,0
Doesn't work. Go back to the original. Bad tear stains within two weeks.  Very disappointed.,0
"My cats LOVE this.  There was another product that I used before finding this particular brand and my cats would on occasion get sick from eating it.  These treats are softer, seem to be fresher than the previous product that I bought for them.  Also, best of all - I have not had any issues with them getting sick from this brand!!!  :)  They love it and I thank you!",1
Both my cats lost a lot of fur where I put the Adams. will never use it again,0
"This teen aged 125 pound stubborn mutt became perfectly trained within one week. This product works and we love our Clyde again. Our pup is a pleasure to have in the house, yard, park or lake. One command and he is by our side. Would strongly recommend this to anyone have issues with their beloved giant dogs. worth every penny. Easy to use and durable.",1
It seems nice enough.  I like the reflective threading (silver threading).  My dog's older collar was looking pretty ragged and this looks nice.,1
"I ordered these with a coupon I got for another purchase.  The plastic jar is filled to the brim and sealed for freshness, even though they are smaller treats these are perfect size for my mastiffs good girl treats, she gobbles them down!",1
Cheap quality. Already tearing and Ive had this item for two weeks.,0
Batteries did not last.  Seems that they may have been old.,0
"I've just adopted a 10-pound pomeranian, and while he was skeptical of being put in a bag, he settled down the second I coaxed him in there. The pad is very soft and fluffy, so it's a comfortable ride. And there is lots of mesh all around the bag, so he seems to be able to see out enough. At his size, the large seems to be a good, roomy fit.
One downside is that the bag doesn't have any exterior pockets for putting things like his leash or other supplies... It's not a dealbreaker, but something to consider.
Another thing to consider: the large bag is a bit of a tight fit under the airplane seat. Most fellow passengers are forgiving that it steals about 1-2 inches of their half of the under-seat space... But some can be curmudgeonly, which is worth knowing.",1
I waited the five week break-in period then sent Chloe out to the front yard that was restored from the winter destruction.  To my surprise she didn't burn the lawn.  Now I have a large area to restore in the back yard but for the last time.  No more burn marks anywhere.,1
I purchased this today at my local pet store and my dog started throwing up 6 hours later! He didn't swallow any pieces! All he did was play with it! I only figured out what made him throw up after reading these reviews,0
"My elderly chihuahua is so annoying when I don't have these bones in the house for him. He LOVES them! I have no idea what is in them that he loves so much.  But if he doesnt get one of these a day hes unbearable. These keep him busy for hours and hours and make him so happy they are worth the price! By the way, amazon has the best price on these anyway! Never stop selling these, please!",1
WAY TOO BIG!,0
"I bought this for my Bernese Mountain Dog. Since they are prone to all types of joint issues, I thought I would start early trying to protect him. Diesel is 8.5 months old. I have a Dodge Diesel 2500 pick up and they are quite tall. Diesel never wanted to go in by himself so that would leave me to hoist his large 80lb butt into the truck. Then after jumping down he would sometimes limp and was always very nervous about jumping out. So this ramp fixed all that. After receiving it I set it up into the truck and called him into the garage. He looked at it, grinned at me and up he went,then down,then up...you get the picture. I know this is not the correct way to train, but when Diesel's in the mood he catches on real quick. He loves rides so he is always impatient for me to set it up so he can get in the truck. But he does manage to wait with great distress. He climbs quickly up the ramp and I am happy that it has a non-slip surface that is permanent not stuck on, and the sides remind him not to step off. It fits ok on the lip of the underneath part of my truck seats if the seats are in the upright position. It's tight but it fits. This thing is heavy when you are trying to unfold it and hold onto a large puppy. The weight is the only downfall, but it's also what makes this sturdy and built so well. The pinch factor is always there too, but if it bends it goes to reason it can pinch you. Be careful and you should be fine. All in all it's a great ramp and remains sturdy while in use.",1
This is hands down the worst pet shower I have ever used. I would not recommend this product.,0
"Pay close attention to your dog with these balls.  Wishing a few minutes, our dog had removed the squeaker from the ball and had the ball stuck on her tongue.  Fortunately we were able to squeeze the ball to remove it; but close (and I mean very close) supervision is recommended with these balls.",0

"This does not prevent fecal odor. In fact it's worse with this litter box than with clumping litter.

"We rescued a 6 year old Miniature Schnauzer who wasn't well fed. We've spent a lot of time and energy developing the right type of food (we feed her RAW dog food w/vegetables). We also supplement her diet with CoQ10 liquid, Krill Oil, Joint Support (she's arthritic) and Liver & Kidney supplements. She gets only NATURAL food products as we discovered what they really put in dog food! These vitamins are just the right amount of 'precaution' and she likes them.",1
"I like it but my cat only went by it and doesn't like even going inside it at all.  Also, it doesn't crinkle that much like a paper sack sound so I was disappointed in that too as my cat LOVES PAPER SACKS.  We bought a tunnel from Walmart that makes the Crinkling sound as he goes inside it or jumps on it and he loves it!!",0
It doesn't clump my kitty's urine as well.  We switched to a different brand and it worked much better.,0
I really loved this but my cat is too fat and the motor kept dying.,1
"My boys don't like it, and these product with flavoring, I believe, are a second choice to gels that include product more helpful for teeth in general.  I do by the enzymatic, but mostly to give medicine unrelated to teeth and gums.",0
"We adopted a cat 3 weeks ago for the first time in our lives and about a week ago, we realized she was not drinking enough water out of her bowl. So after much research, we decided on getting this water fountain because it is ceramic (non-plastic), reasonably priced, and aesthetically pleasing. I also found the reviews reassuring. It took me a while to set it up because we couldn't get the pump & bubbler to align, but it was an easy fix. At first my cat wouldn't go near it because of the bubbling sound. We've kept it on the 2nd speed choice & it is a bit loud and may be annoying for some esp if the fountain is in the living room like for us (hence the 4 stars). But our main priority was our cat's water needs. She started using it in a few hours and although it's only been one day, we've already seen her drinking out of it several times, which we're happy about. She drinks out of the bowl with her paw as well as the fountain itself. We've placed a mat to address any potential spilling but we have a very calm cat so it hasn't been a problem yet. So far, we're very happy with this product because our main goal was to make sure she drinks more water. I'll try to update my review if any problems arise down the road.",1
"I was skeptical of this stuff having any value at all.  Maybe it's just an overpriced powder?
 You can test it at home.
On Probiotics:
  Mix a scoop with a cup of milk and pour a second cup of milk as a base line.  Let both cups sit out for 24-48hrs.  The probiotic grew in the milk and so it's clearly a viable probiotic.
On Turmeric: There's no yellow tent to the powder.  Turmeric is used as a powerful dye so why can't I see a yellow tint?  Test it at home,  put a scoop into a bottle of water and shake it up.  Yellow flakes settle to the bottom of the bottle.

I was skeptical but with this it's easy to confirm at home.",1
"It works. I put it on my 2 Chihuahua pit mix 7 month old pups. They quit after beep 2. They still quietly gruff because they Want to bark at people so bad, but they don't. Much happier letting them play outside now without all the frenetic noise. And for an added bonus it's tied a knot in their little butts so they don't hurl themselves at me and jump in my face. I might have obedient dogs yet.",1
"I bought the 8 panel playpen for a 10 month old shih tzu mix. He is 12lbs and I kept him in it overnight. By morning the rectangle was a trapezoid. He had pushed the panels out of shape.

Before that he did enjoy the toy, it's just not durable enough for a teething pup.",0
everything about it is awful,0
"Very powerful, picks up 3x the stains my smaller uv light does, worth every penny",1
"Instead they eat the bird seed/food in the platform we have next to it.  I put a few unsalted, roasted peanuts in shells on the outside to temp them, but they just took those and leave the pumpkin seeds I put inside that someone recommended alone.  Even if they liked this feeder, it is smaller than I expected and, though a squirrel could fit inside, would be very cramped to move around.  Much more fun to see them eating in the open.",0
My doggy loves these!,1
"This fountain is terrible for a older person to take apart and put back together. Wasted monies on this purchase.  signed, Rose",0
"Clippers worked well on small, medium, and large dogs.",1
Easily bendable material. Barely lasted a week on my dogs collar and the print was off when I received the product.,0
"Very quick delivery!  My dog loves the squeekers! ! Tired of picking up pieces of the toy I bought because she tears it apart to get the squeeker!
Once they arived I dump them on the floor (all 20) and she was so overwhelmed. .lol thanks",1
"GREAT little mice!!! Colorful and textured for easy ""batting"" by my cat and she loves the little ""rattle"" sounds that come from inside. She's already ""flipped"" these all over the house, so they are a great success with her.",1
Maybe this is great product but my dogs will not bite nor eat it.  Useless product ...,0
"It's the only litter my cat will use. I've tried others but this is the only one she will use. All the other ""non-scented"" ones seem to have a scent and this really doesn't. Love it.",1
"It took my cat about 3 days before he gave up the fight and ate his food with this mixed in it, but he's had no problem eating it since then. His skin and coat became more healthy almost instantly ~ he isn't constantly itchy anymore. He's also got an incredibly sensitive stomach, and since I've mixed this in his food, he's not thrown up once (it used to be once or twice a day, even with special food from the vet).
This stuff is a miracle!",1
dog outgrew the size in 4  weeks,0
"Used to heat an outdoor pet house for a cat, produces plenty of heat.  Bulb lasted around 3 months.",0
My cat loves this! I read all the reviews and gave it a try and love it. If the pieces don't seem to fit together (like in some of the reviews) you are probably putting  it together wrong. I made that mistake but tried it again another way and it was perfect,1
My dog doesn't touch this toy? And he loves all sqeeky toys,0
"I bought this to replace an outdoor pen I had for my tortoise.  S,, he is in it most of the summer.  Can't beat it for the price.  I put cheap placemats on the bottom to help preserve the wood since he is a little messy.  So far, it is working out great.  It is a good size.  He is about 7 inches long and it is great for a tortoise that size.",1
"I like the product as i can pack it away each morning. My puppy only sleeps in it at night.  However they need to improve on the zippers,one side keeps separating.",1
"It worked like and absolute charm.  Our vet said it would take a while before Jessie, our golden, who was pulling so hard she knocked us down, to get used to the gentle leader.  Turns out the very first walk  she had totally stopped pulling.  While she at first tried a little to ""rub it off,"" now, when she sees me get it, she knows it's ""walk time"" and sticks her nose out to receive it.  Fabulous, game changer!!!!",1
"Love this bed!! My Large 92 pound Golden Retriever loves the wrap around back especially!! Could use more padding in the bottom though, but sat it on top of another bed and now he loves it..",0
"The fabric of this toy was ripped within several minutes, it's very weak.  We have a small Boston terrier - she's had lots of fabric/plush dog toys for months/years that are still in decent shape.  Disappointed with the durability of this - not for play.  Bought a Fat Cat toy at the same time as this one, she's been playing with it lots and there's no damage.  Would not recommend this toy for any dog that has teeth.  :)",0
My dogs are adjusting very well to the Star mark collars.  They are much easier on my fingers to put on and take off.  Lets just see how long they will last.,1
"Came in the mail fairly quick, however I don't feel like it does a very good job brushing. It just feels like it goes over the top coat. Feels cheap and might break easily. Well it looks like it'll break at least",0
"After I had received this item I placed it down and opened it up so that the cats could find it on their own and try it out. If I would have shown it to them they never would have laid in it. After a few days of them in and out of it,  I placed one of the cats inside, zipped it up and lifted it by the shoulder strap. The stitching holding the strap to bag came undone causing me to almost drop my cat! I will be returning this item and getting something else.",0
This brush is amazing.  We no longer have hair all over our home.  You will be surprised how much hair the brush removes from your pet.  And our dog now loves to be brushed.,1
CATS GOT SICK! THREW UP AND POOPED EVERYWHERE!! SPENT OVER $200 AT THE VET ! CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS FROM FOOD POISONING. DO NOT BUY.,0
This is smaller than I expected and the reason for the 1 star is due to the fact that there is no locking mechanism to keep the top on or in place.,0
nope. broke. first use.,0
"We just rescued a cocker spaniel. He would eat his 3/4 c kibbles in about 10 seconds flat with no chewing of any kibble. Bought this bowl, he now chews his food at meal time which means he's not inhaling his food (and air) and thus no more putrid gas all day.",1
This is a great harness!  Just be sure to measure the chest and you will have the perfect fit.  Also for adjusting please watch the video it is very helpful.,1
all is well with the filters,1
"It's a soft-ish rubber, which splintered and produced small pieces that could potentially cause intestinal blockages if swallowed. It had to be taken away from the dog in just minutes because it became obvious that it was a health hazard. Poorly designed because the ridges that will hold treats like peanut butter or kibble are the pieces that break off and become dangerous shards.",0
These add on panels are a great idea for the CI-600/CI-604 but it makes the playpen even more flimsy. I'm debating whether to keep them or not.,0
Met expectations.,1
Terrible.  Doesn't do anything.  Never again.  Would not recommend.  Does deserve 1 star,0
different color bit worked great,1
Very good substitute for newly hatched brine shrimp.,1
"I purchased a pair of these two years ago to cut our Boston Terrier's toenails. They work well, but after two years of consistent use they needed to be replaced. I wish they had lasted a big more, therefore, I'm rating this a 4/5 stars.

New product works as expected.

Would buy again. And will probably have to in a couple of years! Worth the investment.",1
"What an awesome design!

We only ever found one other covered litter box (traditional design - scooping) that comfortably fit our extra large Maine Coon cats.  Not only is this large enough but the ""roll to separate"" waste design is superior to scooping.  I not have retired my scoop and just roll away the waste now!

Note this is designed for scooping litter.  Never going back to a traditional litter box.  Don't waste $ on an automatic litter box.  This is the best one out there, IMHO.",1
Easy to put together and my Cats absolutely love it. So do I. Happy Kitties.,1
"Never could get it to work properly -- no matter what I set the desired temperature, it just kept heating.  Set for 70, soon the water is 86.  Press and hold the button and it looks like it turns off, but touch the heater in the tank an hour later and the heater glass is still very hot (because it's actually heating.)",0

The material is not worth the $25 +.,0
My dog stresses and this products definitely calmed her down.,1
"I think the soft chew form of this product was working. When I was running out,  I re-ordered the tablet form accidently. I continued administering the tablet form according to the content directions when I ran out of the soft chews. They are totally ineffective. All the progress made after 3 weeks of working on this problem has turned to crap!. The soft chews of this product seem to have  a good effect, but the tablets do not work for my problem child. I have a Chessie and a Lab.",0
The best part of this tie out is it does not tangle and that is wonderful! It is light enough that my dogs didn't feel like they were dragging a ton behind them. Sturdy and well made.,1
"Made in China, need I say more",0
"As the other reviewer states, the company now sources all of its ingredients in the USA (hooray).  While weaning our rescues off of junk food, we 'sampled' a lot of high end cat food brands before they let us know that this one is the bomb.

The cats eat all of the minced varieties from this brand (except chicken - whoever heard of cats who wont' eat chicken) - salmon, duck, tuna, rabbit and lamb.  Snarf up all of these flavors.  They just don't like the flaked versions and we're grateful that the food comes in two consistencies - minced with gravy and flaked with gravy.  Well, everyone loves the gravy...lol.

We're also transitioning to raw and this brand helps with that transition.  Great ingredients and worth every penny.",1
My dogs love these! Very durable!,1
"My Chiweenie's favorite special treat is the Lickety Stik!  She loves to lick the roller ball, already have the liver flavor but wanted to try the bacon.  She loves the bacon flavor even more!!  Can't wait to try the other flavors for her...she looks so cute lapping at the roller ball....",1
"Had the unit for one month after which the receiver quit completely with no warning. Customer service did an admirable job in trying to assist from the UK, but to no avail. For the short time it did work, it did a good job of tracking my wayward cat. But hey, it's made in China...so what should I have expected?? Save your money for a more reliable tracking system.",0
"I bought two of these for a 5 gal nano tank.  No matter what temperature I set them at, even if I peg the thermostat all the way to it's highest setting, it won't heat the water above 80 deg. F.  This is a problem because some fish like warmer water and if your tank gets Ich you want higher temperatures.  Raising the water temperature to 86-88*F is recommended to treat Ich because it speeds up the life cycle of the parasite, and also seems to create a hostile environment for the parasite, while not harming the fish.  It's not that the wattage is too low, it's the correct wattage for a 5 gal tank.  So, it's an issue with the thermostat.  These heaters are a great size for a nano tank, so it's a real shame they don't work correctly.  Another problem with it is that the water temperature can get a couple of degrees below the set temperature before it comes on.  I finally got tired of trying to deal with these heaters and am replacing them.",0
Works great thanks Amazon.com,1
"Peace River has the perfect grain size for plants. Large enough for some water circulation, but small enough so debris doesn't fall down between the grains.",1
"I received this leash today and tried it out with my 45 pound husky.  It is a simple leash mechanism, but it did hold her back.  I'm not sure how long the quality would last for, but for the price it is a good buy.  I have had my husky bite through one of these types of leashes before, and I'm sure she could bite through this one too.  I typically only use leather leashes to walk her, but I like these type of leashes for when I am letting her out to pee and I don't want to go outside because it is raining or snowing, or I'm just being lazy.  I would recommend this leash if you have a dog that doesn't like to pull hard on a walk, or want a quick long leash to let the dog out to use the bathroom.  I received this leash for free to write a non biased review.",1
good product works as described.,1
"I have 12"", 18"" & 25"" chuckit launchers and this mini launcher will toss almost as far as the longer ones if you have a strong arm - you're pushing against the limitations of the ball's aerodynamics either way. You really need to muscle this thing to get the same result, though. If you want to give your arm a rest while throwing far I recommend at least the 18"" version. 25"" version has the added bonus of not having to bend over. Personally, I use this one daily just for its pocket-portability and never bother with the big sticks.",1
Faded after a few washes,0
"My pup is quite a handful...he tends to chew up everything in sight. That's exactly why I had to switch him from his wire kennel to a plastic one. After a while in the plastic kennel, I figured we'd try to go back to the wire one as long as I had something other than a blanket to cover it. That brings me to this product.

After tons of research and lots of reading, I decided to buy the Precision Pet Indoor/Outdoor Crate cover. Best buy! I have had the cover for a couple weeks now and finally I've found something he hasn't destroyed (yet)! I love the zipper and roll up features, all of the windows. It's great! Perfect for my little pup who likes being in a more den like space. Must buy for those who have dogs that destroy anything put over their kennel.",1
Our cats love this flavor and will willingly take their medicine if they know that they will get one of these after taking their meds.,1
"Unfortunately, this product didn't really do anything to curb our cats' problem behaviors.  I feel a little bit like a fool right now for having spent money on this.",0
"I bought 6 tablets each for my 2 dogs and cat. I would never get this again as it never really helped with the fleas!!! My poor babies are still covered in fleas!  I spent $75 and now I have to get something else, which isn't good when your on a budget.",0
All three of our dogs love these chicken-covered rawhides.,1
"I have a 85LB dog, runs right through it. Also, when the dog lays down on the collar, which is on his neck the base beeps continuously. The batteries do not support this system well. I charge them for 24 hours and they last for 5. We put another collar on the dog from DOGTRA which worked amazing. Perimeter is very expensive and its best practical use is a boat anchor.",0
Our pups love them! Good treat and good price for so many!,1
I have been using this in my dogs food for the last 3 years she is 16. She had shakes in her front legs and now they are gone. She also likes the taste.,1
"Unfortunately the mild compression of this shirt made our dog physically ill. Introduced it with a treat and used as directed, but didn't work for our severely anxious dog. It was our last drug free option. However returning it was easy and hassle free! So thankful for great customer service through amazon prime.",0
My dog don't like it. Sorry.,0
I've been feeding my Malti-Poo these since she was old enough. She loves these treats and it's easy to get her the supplements she needs with these treats. Will be ordering again.,1
Light weight it does stay cool when wet,1
"Kong seems to produce great dog toys.  The classic Kong is the most reliable toy we own.  I fill the Kongs with canned dog food and toss in the freezer.  The frozen treats give me an hour plus of quiet time.  The Kong is versatile.  You can fill them with any dog safe food that will fit, or just it leave it empty to use for fetch.  The toy is constructed with a very durable rubber.  I've owned some for over 5 years now, and they are still as good as new.  Easy to clean, I throw them in the dishwasher.

I gave this product 4 stars because of the price.  Like all dog products, this is a little overpriced.",1
"These treats gave my Golden Retriever horrible diarrhea. She didn't feel like eating her normal food and seemed lethargic for a day after giving her the SmartStick. Glycerin, Sorbitol, and Fructose are the third, fourth, and fifth ingredients, respectively. I think this may have been too much sugar for her to process. I also found these treats were sort of messy--they left residue on her paws and on my flooring. I wouldn't recommend these SmartSticks based on my experience.",0
"I have used other liquid additives in the past that have worked on my Yorkie's terrible breath, but this one didn't do anything for him.  I've went through the entire bottle, and no results.",0
The only good that we feed our dog! Ounce pricing is cheaper here than it is at the store.,1

"Absolute garbage. I've had good luck with Advantage in the past and I have always been told Frontline was just as good. Tried it on 3 separate occasions now, and not only did it not work, it seems like it's made the fleas worse! Plus my cat is miserable and looks sick. He's not typically a vomitor like some cats are, and has been puking and is very lethargic. I can tell it's messing with him. I will never buy this product or anything that Frontline makes again!",0
"I thought this would be a great toy for my 7 m.o. Golden.  Lots of squeekers and no stuffing.  It lasted 5 mins.  First couple of minutes he was trying to eat the fur.  By minute 5 he had torn half the head off!  Into the trash it went, the poor thing :(",0
Great swing. My African grey had had one for 10 years and it still looks new. This one is for my macaw & one for me eclectus.,1
Cat won't eat it all. She only eats the white meat and laps up the gravy. She leaves the dark pieces.,0
Measured my dog (English Bulldog) and bought a large because according to the posted specs that would leave some room to grow. It took over a month to receive this product and not only does it not fit my dog a large didn't even fit my daughter's stuffed dog.,0
"I ordered a large for my 10 pound Chihuahua mix and it fits him snuggly.  I'm thinking that I probably could've ordered an XL and just have the Velcro overlap a bit.  I bought these because he just started marking in the house and he's about to turn 11 years old.  He has had a few accidents with the bellyband on but not daily as he was before.  The first time I just put a pantiliner in the bellyband and he peed through both. He now has to wear maxi pads in his bellyband but those absorb all of the pee. I do love that there's four because every time he soils one it has to go in the wash.  They wash up nicely but I would suggest putting them in a bag that you would use for delicates or sweaters when washing because the Velcro will stick to everything.

He actually hasn't been marking regularly for the past week so fingers crossed this will break him of the habit.  The patterns are so adorable and that just makes it cuter when he has to wear a male diaper!!",1
Cheap do not buy for a big dog,0
Own two of these.  Immediate response from my terriers. Calming effect. Well made. Weathers the elements.,1
"Cats love it!  Whips up easily in the morning.  I use the hot water heated for making my tea - mix it really thick with the hot water until it's thoroughly rehydrated, then add enough cold to cool it down and make it the consistency he prefers (he like to lap it up, so i make it pretty thin).  Cost effective (seriously, comparing the $ to canned catfood (which is really crappy food by comparison) and it's about 1/4 the cost).  And, of course, you're feeding your cat literally the best food you could be feeding them; the cat eats a healthier diet than *I* do, that's for sure!
.
It's also incredibly useful if you've got a sick kitty who needs to be spoon-fed and cannot swallow very well, because you can thin it down to the liquid-content they require in order to be able to easily drink it off the spoon - and you know they're getting the best calories you could be giving them.  It's also really handy that you can hide supplements & meds in the liquid easily.",1
"Good product, life and shipping..for my small dog.. Re-ordered numerous times..will keep reordering if price stays as is..",1
"Like this very much.  I purchased two, and one was cracked at the top, but it does not leak, so I kept it.  I have two betta's and I put these back to back so that it appears as one round aquarium.",1
"I had done quite a bit of reading and came across some chatter about this horse/pet product causing wonderful results on humans.  This conditioner is marketed as a regrowth/rebuilder/repairer for animals'  coats, skin, hoofs, paws.  The claims of human hair regrowth/thickening were what interested me.  There are quite a few comparisons to a similar product, Ovation Cell Therapy that is purported to be more expensive w/ similar or same ingredients.  I have not tried Ovation nor have I bothered to do an ingredient comparison, but I can tell you that Ovation's  manufacturer (DH Labs) = its parent company is EQyss - the company that makes Mega-Tek.

I ordered from Amazon (twice - got the small  2 oz size first to try, loved so much, went back and ordered the 16 fl oz full size.)

Instructions are to apply as a conditioner, leave on for 5 min and then rinse out.  I have used on a daily basis for a month and I LOVE it!  Its white consistency is a little thicker than my ordinary daily conditioner, but not as thick as a deep conditioner.  It has a light almost tropical scent.

I started by using as an all over conditioner, which was great, but since no one can re-grow hair at the ends, and due to the expense, I have been using on only my scalp for the past few weeks and then letting the rinsing action coat the rest of my hair like a normal conditioner.

I see less hair coming out when I rinse my hair and less on my hairbrush when styling.  I can't speak to regrowth (I have a LOT of hair, but it is VERY fine, so I can't tell if there is regrowth) , but I can say it certainly does make my fine, color-treated layered bobbed hair look/feel thicker, fuller and like there is more of it and the effect, once I style and spray hairspray, lasts all day!

From my bottle:  ""....revolutionary formula is a technological breakthrough.  Stimulates hair w/out the use of silicone, synthetic polymers, oils or petroleum based products.  This advanced formula corrects the structure of weakened, dry, damaged coats, returning elasticity and restoring strength.  Reduces hair breakage, repairs split ends and damaged hair.  Removes damaging toxins, medications and chemical residues.  Soothes hot spots and is safe for dry noses.""  I also read somewhere that it is also good for dry, cracked cuticles.  It is also ""cruelty free, environmentally friendly.""

This stuff is great and even though it is more than 2x the price of my regular ds conditioner, it is sooo worth it because it has taken the place of my daily conditioner and my 1-2x/week deep conditioner.  I have had NO issue of build-up or color stripping.  My fine hair appears much thicker and has more body = I am a VERY happy camper!!",1
Great price...cheaper than Walmart.  My cat loves them.  Will be buying these again!,1
Red Eared Slider doesnt like the food and it clouds up the water. Not happy with it and you cant return it.,0
Bought this in December and its no longer working.  Even changed the battery.  How do i go about returning to get a new one?,0
our dog has a grain allergy and he has been eating this food for over a year and doing much better.  before this food his hair was falling out and now his coat is filled and in and has a healthy sheen to it.  recommend.  great price here at amazon too.,1
These are the best treats for training purposes.,1
"Ordered the large; my German Shep is 87 lbs.  She loves them but my challenge is always finding something she doesn't chew up in 3 minutes.  Since this one lasted about 12 minutes of occupation for her and does NOT create a mess in the house and carpet, a good success.",1
Extra large bed - - sometimes two of my labs sleep together on it.  Purchased it to provide extra comfort for kennel visits.  Gives my dogs comfort and lots of cushioning between them and the kennel floor.  Durable cover that is easily cleaned.  I did purchase two more cushions - size large - so that all three of my dogs have their own cushion.  Highly Recommend.,1
"So I bought this for my lab/golden cross to remove some of his shedding undercoat.  It does not work.  Not only that, but it also cut several guard hairs, something I did not want in a rake.  I was looking for something to remove shedding hair, without damaging coat, but this will certainly damage my boy's coat.  He's a guide dog, so I can't have that.  I'll give this one more try and update accordingly, but right now, I can't say this is as advertised.",0
New packaging. 10% less product. Approximate 3% price increase per package. So now we pay more to get less. And the treats that are labeled the same as before are smaller and much harder like they were over cooked.,0
Within less than a month after I received this extendable dog leash it began to jam and would not retract the leash into the handle without hitting the handle on the plam of my hand or hip or something convenient. The leash has got to the point that it almost unusable as it just dosen't retract anymore. I was expecting much more use out of this leash than a couple of months.,0
not strong enough suction did not like it at all a waste of money,0
I bought this for our hermit crabs.  It's our solution for extended vacations.  It works great!  The hermit crabs seem just as pleased.  I think what makes this a great purchase beyond the above stated benefit is that it creates a shallow watering hole.  Hermit crabs require shallow bowls so they don't drown.  It's a smart buy!,1
I thought this was the name brand and it was not. I hate it !!!!!,0
What a waste of money.  The teeth are too large to go through fur or knots and the blades don't come out far enough to remove the knots.  Waste!,0
Good price shipped well my dogs didn't like them,0
I knew I should have read the other reviews. I agree with the guy that said he would rather hold a vacuum in one hand while using the FURminator in the other. The only thing I saved was the adapter which fit my Orick mini-vac.,0
I thought that the indented corners wouldn't be a problem because I use high clumping litter.  It was definitely a problem.  That was only one of the problems.  I ended up not being able to use the sides at all because the box was too small for the cat.  Even with the top off he struggled with trying to cover up and even had to go outside the box and spread litter all over the place.  I will have to look for another solution.,0
great item,1
"This is a great toy, but it was shipped to me, folded in half.  This makes no sense at all, because it needed to be sturdy to truly support a strong biter, and the middle was always weak and a bit flimsy after that, which led to a shorter life of the toy.",0
This product allowed my 14 year old dog to remain mobile for his last few months. I put this up when he couldn't go up and down the stairs anymore.  I would recommend adding more tape to the ramp though.  Spend a little time walking your dog up and down the ramp usiing a leash as a way of getting them used to it.  I walked on it to test it and it held my weight easily (195lbs). It is easy to fold and is very mobile. could be used to get that big dog in and out of the car when u can no longer lift them.,1
"I love it!  Heed the size warnings. My petite 9 lb Chi mix fits the medium. I haven't washed it yet it will most likely shrink.
But it is the cutest thing ever. I ordered a Large for my 10 lb Chi that will probably be perfect.",1
As expected,1
"I have two 30+ pound puppies, one of which loves to dig in the water bowl. Sometimes I'd have to clean up 1/2 gallon of water from the floor 4-6 times in a day. I had raised the bowl up to discourage him, but the blasted puppy insist on growing. Since I can't raise his water dish up any more, I googled some solutions. Thankfully, someone recommended the Buddy Bowl, and it's stopped the behavior in its tracks, and a side benefit has been that my puppies' ears no longer drag in the water.

My kitchen floor and towels are very grateful for the break, as is my back.",1
Had no effect whatsoever  on my kitten.  I sprayed my cloth chairs and he jumped right on them immediately.  Did not deter him away from the furniture.,0
"Received a completely different product than what was pictured. They were not cartridges, but whole one piece assemblies. I Had to reroute the tubing to make it work. And each time I need to replace I have to take off the top assembly, disconnect hoses etc, instead of changing a cartridge. Would not trust buying again not knowing if you are going to get the product advertised.",0
My dog had it ripped to shreds and gobbling down the stuffing in no time at all. Left him unattended for about 5 minutes. Not too durable!,0
"My pit bull Lila destroys everything. This toy lasted longer than most. She saved the monkey's face and carried it around and slept with it for a few days too. The rope body isn't especially strong and was shredded within the first few hours, but she had fun doing it.",1
"I didn't care for this product at all. The litter is a bit heavier than the normal lightweight brands.  We only have one cat. However, we clean the cat lItter 2 to 3 times a day. This particular litter holds the smell of dampness and chunks up in little pieces . Doesn't seem sanitary in the long run. I did not care for this at all. Couldn't wait until it was finished. Went back to the lightweight brands that you can find in any store. My most favorite is Purina's tidy cat lightweight. It's not over scented. It truly is a lightweight. To me it's a better brand. Doesn't chunk up on you. Easy cleanup. Sanitary.",0
"This is good for water plants. Not good for beta fish not enough room for heater, filter. My beta fish died.",0
"Squeaker is VERY loud, and my dog (granted she is a chewer) tore it up in about 10 minutes. She sure loved it for those 10 minutes though.",0
tried 2 different sizes and neither stayed on my kitty.,0
"These probably would have gotten a 5 star rating if I could get them on my dogs :(

I have two pit mixes that are around 60lbs each. The packaging says they ""accommodate dogs weighing 45 - 80 pounds""  I didn't think to measure my dogs feet when purchasing - I just looked at the weight and thought they would fit. These bands have no give (it would be GREAT if they were made with elastic) and do not take into consideration paw pad / leg size. I could get the bands on my female's front legs but not on the back. Like I said, there's no give in order to get the bands over the joints of the back legs. I almost ripped them trying to do so. I didn't even bother trying to put them on my male dog's feet (one look at his huge pads and I knew it would be a waste of my life). Make sure to measure your dogs paws and the width of their back leg joints before buying.",0
"I have big dogs (Irish Wolfhounds) and the Gentle Leader encourages my puller to walk nicely on leash, even when separated from his brother. It gives me peace of mind when walking both dogs by myself that if they should see something and want to chase, I will not lose my grip on them. I have used the Halti in the past on a different dog and liked it. I like the GL a little better because it has fewer straps and doesn't restrict the mouth at all.",1

"This review is regarding the ivory cat tree model B7701. This cat tree was simple to put together and the directions very easy to follow. I was pleased to find that all of the pieces except the ramp are made from plywood and not from particle or press board. The ramp is made from particle or press board. All pieces seem sturdy once assembled.  My large 15 lb cat very easily fits in the large cubby with room to spare. My only complaint is that it's a little high for him to jump up to at his old age, but that is easily remedied with a stool or something. My younger cat loves the entire tree! (I say entire, but I didn't put on the very highest level since it would be too high for my cats to see out the window and I was feeling a bit lazy.) He played on the tree batting around the two toys for the longest time! (That is until he broke off the two toys, but the directions do say ""The hanging toy that comes with the product is not designed for long term usage, but for display purposes only. . . We suggest you purchase the hanging toy at your local pet store."") He was rolling and jumping all over the place with no issue. He used the scratching posts happily. Unfortunately the ramp on this arrived cracked so I can't comment on the usefulness of that yet, but my young cat doesn't need it and my elderly declawed rescue may not be able or want to use it. The upper cubby I received had the holes drilled in the wrong corners which I could have easily rememdied myself with a drill, but I didn't since I'm waiting for an entire replacement due to the broken ramp. I am not removing any stars for the broken piece and mis-drilled holes because these are an isolated error and not reflective of the product in general.",1
My dog had it one hour and it no longer squeaked..  :-(,0
My wife bought me this filter for our 46 gallon bowfront and it is my first canister filter. It was very easy to set up and it creates the best flow and circulation my tank has ever seen.,1
Could not read the instructions -- they were obviously written by non-English speaker and the English translation was extremely poor. Returned it.,0
"Chinese made product have gotten a bad reputation for a reason. Quality lacks, and sometimes toxic substances squeak past inspections (e.g. poisen dog food, baby formula, etc.). This product is made in China. Not sure what the resin is made out of, but it smells like elmer's glue, and the structure absorbs water (the hut is porous). Also not sure about the paint job. Looks like a child painted this product. No where on the product or label does it say that it is free of toxins. The only thing I see aside from the brand name is a MADE in CHINA stamp. China does not have a good track record for protecting its consumers. We care about our tortoise and, like a family member (animal or person), we don't want to poisen it with an iffy product. I gave two stars for the fact that it provides shelter. I can't really make a prediction that it will hold up. I'll be looking for a quality alternative shelter as soon as I am done posting this review/experience.",0
It works as intended. Sometimes have to beat on the bottom of it but that's just how cat litter boxes work.,1
"They work alright, and do not scratch my drinkwell fountain as much as my first ones did (the ones made when the original drinkwell came out) But, I like the quality of my old brushes better.  The bristles on these ones flattened out and some or most of the bristles fell off.  Now, maybe it's just mine...  All in all I will not re-purchase this cleaning kit.  I think I would have better luck in going out and purchasing a baby bottle brush...",0
"Dory loves this toy. It flies super far, many at the dog park that use ""that other brand Chucker"" ask about this and where I got it. I tell them AMAZON, best ever!",1
"The first collar I received was missing the battery and battery cover.  The replacement arrived with all the necessary parts, but after a week my dog just barks and barks with it on.  I've done everything the manual says and have contacted the company's customer support center who tells me since I bought it on Amazon they can not help me.  Biggest waste of money ever!",0
"I love this toy! For the dog who has everything, it's perfect! dog adored it too. When you throw it, it bounces crazy directions. She's a heavy chewer and she hasn't chewed it to destroy it either. Great price great toy.",1
Nice product. Clearly engraved and seems durable. Would order this again.,1
"I have 7 dogs, from a 3 pound chi/terrier mix to a great dane. They all eat this. It has helped my overweight dogs lose some weight, while keeping my active dogs full of energy.",1
"This harness is great. I'll be back to buy another one for my other lab. It ran bigger than I thought, I wasn't sure about the sizing and bought the XL for my 85lb lab. There was plenty of room with some to spare. I could have bought the L and it would have fit perfectly. My dog normally pulls when we walk but he is great with this harness. The handle on top is perfect with extra control for the occasional cat or squirrel.",1
"yes it is not an $80 plush cover coordinated with your kennel colors...but it does the job and is easy to use, goes on and stays in place well. It does the job and is very reasonably priced. I use this not only in grooming area to let my dog rest, but back at the hotel. I think he rests more with the darker color helping his crate become more of a den. I would recommend this to anyone with the caveat that this is not heavy duck canvas and if you or your dog don't manhandle it or catch it on rough table legs or other surfaces that will rip or tear it, it should work well for you. And the price is right!!",1
"I know this product well.  It is is definitely a product I would recommend.

However, I would NOT recommend the seller.  The photo advertises the product as having a nozzle for squirting the wash in to the dog's ear.  The product that arrived for me has a flip top, definitely not something I would use to for putting the product in a dog's ear.  If the seller is going to have a product photo, use the appropriate photo for what they are selling.  Otherwise, false advertising.  Because of this inconsistency and therefore challenge in administering the ear wash, I definitely will NOT buy anything from this seller again.",0
2 weeks in and our 1 year old pit bull hasn't destroyed it yet! This was thing is seriously a life saver! The picture is right after picking him up from the vet.,1
No one has contacted me to send me out anything to make this right. I have a kennel that can even be put together. Desperate !!!!,0
This raccoon is really big. My dog was so excited to get it. My first impression was how good it looked and really seemed quality made. It had a really good grunter and my dog goes crazy for that. I guess it had too good of a grunter because my dog had it out by the time I got home from work the next day after getting it. Anything with a grunter doesn't stand a chance so I really can't fault the maker of the raccoon. I just put all the stuffing back in and will sow up his ripped neck (grunter is not getting put back). Now it can just be his baby.,1
Arrived with no flip-top lid,0
"Nice bag, good quality material, sturdy. Not big enough to hold a full bale of timothy grass by about 8 inches.",1
I really like the shape and style of this pet house. I use it for my cat boxes. It works great for that and my cats didn't have trouble getting use to it. It was very easy to put together.,1
"Love it love it. Fits great and is a well made, comfortable secure harness.",1
the guinea pigs love it as well.  Arrived when it was supposed to.,1
"I thougth this was worth a try. A new treat for my 2 kitties. Unfortunately, they each just watched the bubbles fall to the floor and pop. One of them did sniff the spot where the bubbles broke, but that was about it. Nice idea, but no treat for my 2 kitties anyway.",0
These dental dinosaurs are the best dog toy that I've found.  My lab is an aggressive chewer and a dinosaur can last about 30 days as a full fledged looking dinosaur.  She continues to chew the toy until all you can see is a small unidentifiable circle for a few years.  Both of my dogs prefer the T-Rex the best.  Second choice of theirs is the Stegosaurus.  I wholeheartedly recommend this toy for any aggressive chewer.,1
My Golden has hip dysplasia--this product has really has helped!,1
The top camp in broken at the bottom of the tank. Very disappointing.,0
My kittens liked it but it's not very padded and they've outgrown it quickly. It's ok. Great for kittens. Just wish it was more padded. Carpet is better I think.,1
"This didn't really do anything for my dogs plaque, even after weeks of use",0
Very nice quality!,1
Love these! My lab has knee and hip issues and will spit out any pill or treat with glucosamine in them but loves these and they have help him with his limping!,1
Impossible for me to assemble so it sits in a pile in a room.,0
"Finally, a good meal that my dog (Miss Picky) will eat .... instead of the cat's food.",1
"Great leash, just expect...  to become a little spoiled. I use it everyday, for my dachshund. I carry a Walkingstick with me, so it's nice to be hands-free from time to time. Especially when I have to pick up her poop. I have also used this leash for another 50 pound dog and it works just as well. If you ever at one point get where you want to detach it can become a regular leash. It has an additional metal ring if you want to clip something light weight. I have bought one for my father for his B-day.",1
"Cheap product.  Carpet was ripped off by cat very quickly because it is very thin and attached to cardboard, not wood.  Because it is made of cardboard the whole top level broke and fell off after about 2 weeks of usage.  Cheap product and I do not recommend.",0
"We've purchased several bags from amazon.com with no problems at all but the last bag we purchased has made our dogs very sick they are both having diarrhea and vomiting during the day and night. We have stopped feeding them the dog food and they are much better now. I'm not sure why all of a sudden they became ill, assuming we received a bad bag.",0
"This is what I've been looking for. Excellent pet life jacket, good quallity and fast shipping.
Thanks",1
Made my cat vomit several times.,0
We have a medium sized dog and this works perfectly!  We keep it on the very first setting and that's all that's needed. Works great and it's easy to use.,1
"The first day I received the SSSCAT I set it up.  It worked but I also kept setting it off when I got within a few feet of it.  Got sprayed myself wuite a few times.  I turned it off until bedtime- which is when the little monsters do the bad stuff- and when I went to turn it back on, it wouldn't work.  I dis-assembled and reassembled, but no luck.  I sent it back.",0
very interactive for kitten,1
"This product is ok. I did not notice any real difference either good or bad using it. So I am not sure if it does or does not do what it claims, my vet did say not to waste your money on it as it is just ""snake oil"" so I am not sure. But if you are like me then a few bucks to give something a try is worth it. Ya never know till you try.",1
Great treat pouch!  Only down side is my son always wants to carry it and keeps it zipped up so the dog doesnt sneak any. Lol. Might have to buy a second one for me to use.,1
"I want to save you from disappointment. Do not spend good money on this flimsy product. This gallon pump is very cheaply made. When I received it and took it out of the plastic wrapper, the top immediately separated from the straw. I tried to put it back together but then realized it didn't only separate but it was actually cracked. This was probably the reason it came apart in the first place. I tried to get it to work anyhow and the straw piece fell into my gallon jug. When I went to return it I was prompted to send the item back. It will cost me about as much to send it back as it will to just buy a replacement. I will look somewhere else for better quality and even if I have to pay a little more, I hope the difference in quality will make the difference in satisfaction. I would bet anyone who left positive feedback has not had this item long enough. It does not look like it would hold up over time.",0
I have a 100lb 1 year old labradoodle that has a tendency to pull me down (He is sweet but gets excited easily). I bought this after I endured a few scraps and bruises....Worked instantly! He still tries to pull but is MUCH easier to control.,1
My dogs totally love this dry food and are so excited when they see it's meal time... they are healthy happy and shiney little guys... great food..,1
Did the job keep paws from freezing,1
"When i recieved the case of cat food. Opened 1 can and was bad. food was runney. So i opened another can and it was the same way. It was like it sat some where, where it was really hot. Sent back through and got a full refund. Was afraid to reorder.",0
I don't know why but our dogs won't go near these,0
"We like Kong toys in general, they usually hold up very well. We had a problem with this Bear toy though.  The arms and legs of this toy have a thick knotted rope inside of them to maintain the shape.  We have a Rottweiler that recently started throwing up and not eating. $800.00 in vet bills later, we found out that he had ingested a big piece of the knotted rope and it got stuck in his small intestine. He doesn't usually ingest things, he just rips his toys apart and leaves them laying on the ground.  Not sure what happened this time, we're thinking he might have been pulling on the leg so hard, that when it finally tore, he swallowed it accidentally.

Anyway, just a warning, if you give these toys to your dogs, monitor them very closely. Even though our dogs liked these, they won't be getting them again.",0
"super great fit, and seems like it is really comfortable.  Fit my puppy since she first got home (just under 3 lbs) and still fits her (just over 4 lbs).  Seems like there's still room to grow (maybe up to 7 lbs??)  Great quality too.",1
Perfect a dachshund who love to eat and eat fast.,1
This worked wonders for our dog who loves to scarf her food down in 10 seconds flat. Now she has no choice but to slow down!,1
"I bought this 2 weeks ago and I'm extremely disappointed in the product. My puppy's pee would leak through the cover within seconds. It is not water proof. When taken the foam out, little pieces of the foam would fall off. On top of that, the zipper does not go all the way, it is extremely hard and annoying to put the foam back in the cover. I would not buy this again.",0
Very low volume of air - not very powerful,0
This litter box sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It is a total waste of money! I wouldnt recommend it to anyone! They need to be more detailed about the product when advertising it! I wish I wouldnt have wasted my money on this piece of trash. I'd rather clean out the litter box myself than to own one of this!!,0
Have used these with my Chihuahua for several years.  She loves them and her teeth apparently do too!  They are beautiful and clean and she considers this quite a treat.  Less expensive through this seller than in the grocery stores.  Will continue doing business with this seller.,1
"Nice bed. Comfortable enough for me to sleep on! Both of my Mastiffs like it. I like that the cover zipper is on the long side, making it easier to remove and replace.",1
"This didn't work for my dog, he hates things on his face so he was able to take it off in seconds with ease even on its tightest.",0
SORRY FOLKS - THIS DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.  I am totally disappointed to report that this simply does not work.  My dog willingly let me put it on him & kept it on without problem.  However there was absolutely no reduction in his anxiety.  He is terrified of fireworks.  I live on the Bay and have a great view of fireworks which go off every weekend in the summer.  But my poor dog spends the entire evening hiding in the bathtub.  Willing to try ANYTHING I purchase this coat (much to the amusement of my friends & family).  I was desperate to try anything to calm my little furry baby's nerves.  Unfortunately this simply does not work at all.  I am open to other suggestions if anyone has any!  Please send them my way.,0
good price. delivered quickly.,1
"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015G8KOY2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0  This was a gift for my sister and brother in law.  They were very pleased with this Pet Stroller,  they liked how much room there was for both of their small dogs.  Very easy to fold up and easy to transport.  This is a great product for people who love their dogs.",1
"After sanding tips of quick connect, it works fine. Before sanding the clamp would not open far enough.",1
"The price is great. That's about the best thing I can say about this product. Then again, price doesn't matter if the product is useless. The first time we tried it, I didn't really notice it working very well. My dog actually pulled on the leash MORE than when I used a regular collar. And when he did pull, I thought that the ring on the front was supposed to redirect him. Didn't seem to be the case. On the second use, one of the plastic snaps just broke. He wasn't even pulling very hard at the time. I tried this product because a close friend recommended it to me. But I just don't see the point. It also did nothing to stop his jumping (note that the product is not advertised to stop it. But again, whats the point?). Its a good idea in theory.... but the price point is too low to make anything of quality. I would have loved to have given it some more time and use, but it broke so quickly and easily. I will stick to the prong collar. I've gotten great results with that!",0
My pup uses it for every nap!,1
"Probably one of the best hamster cages out there--and certainly one of the most expensive. So many of them are made to look fun but aren't all that functional. With most, you hardly ever see the hamster (who's burrowed somewhere). The clear bottom makes this a great design. The shortcomings are (1) kind of a cheap wheel that will likely need to be replaced; and (2) the mid-level floor is solid plastic, which is the safest for the hamster but will need to be removed to clean. Our first one arrived damaged but Amazon was great about sending an immediate replacement (that was carefully bubble-wrapped this time.) Given the options, this (fancy Italian-made) cage is a great choice.

Update: After using the cage for a month, here are a few notes... (1) The water bottle is flimsy and subject to chewing. Replace with something that sits outside the cage. (2) The wheel is small, so only for a dwarf hamster or a gerbil. Replace with 8"" or larger for standard hamster. (3) The hole for mounting tube-extensions isn't compatible with the size of the common brands sold in the U.S. (4) The hide/house is also sized for a dwarf hamster or gerbil rather than a standard-sized hamster. (5) The smallish, top-mounted opening is GENIUS. Hamsters and gerbils are escape artists and the placement and size of this opening minimizes the chance of escape.

Final take--even with having to make a few upgrades, it's still the best on the market.",1
"Awesome filter,
Works like it should.",1
Was better than expected. The tag is clearly written and easy to read,1
"I have gotten 3 of these that were defective (poor workmanship) and the company kept sending replacements. I finally got one that appeared to be sewn well and no gaps where screen meets fabric. I don't use it often but after 7 uses, this one came apart as well! Companies states the warranty is no longer in effect...
Spend a little more for a better quality bag!",0
"Works very well. Gets rid of smells for good.

Be careful not to put too much in one spot- it's hard to vacuum all the way out, but overall a very great product.",1
Get it!  The best pet comb I've ever used!,1
Didn't work. It came on 90 degrees and stood there no matter what.,0
"Is size Large, like other was too small",0
"Fast delivery, product was exactly as shown",1
"it needs a better hookup for the hose , other than that it works well.",1
It was broken. I had to return it.,0
Perfect for my 100lbs american bulldog,1
"Really wanted this to work.  Did nothing.  Cat still spraying right next to the diffuser,  used in addition to the Feliway spray.  No help.",0
This may be good for dog food.  I tried using it as a treat since my trainer did in puppy class.  So I will be giving this to the triner since I don't get that reaction out of him,1
"Love this!  I put their treats in this and reward them while I am training them.  I have it hang around the back with it open for easy retrieval.  The only time it gets to be a problem is when they learn that is where it is located and one of my three dogs sneaks around to my back and helps themselves while I am training another in front of me.  So many times before I got this, I would forget to take treats along, or I didn't have pockets.  I also put my cell phone in it and hang the poop bags off the side hoop, it works great.  I can even put our fold up Frisbee in it.",1
"2nd set, love 'em",1
"We're using this indoors for 2 fat bunnies. Although the ramp was not very sturdy, the bunnies have very much enjoyed the space, and it's working well for our space...",1
"Zero starts if I could. The item came in a half open, thin, flimsy box. The entire interior plate insert came shattered and dusty. And the actual crate itself is so dented and scratched that it isn't even usable because you can't even get the parts to stand up straight to set it up. If you want an item that comes damaged then go ahead and order from this seller. Save your money. They won't even exchange it. Flimsy. Defective. Destroyed. Used. Absolutely ridiculous.",0
Dogs are doing great on it and my Maltese who never want to eat has been eating all her meal..,1

"Took a month to be delivered, is not a good quality, the bottom padding is not secure and moves from one side to the other. Sometimes the dog pretty much lays on the floor becouse is just the fabric between the dog and the floor,I would not buy it again.",0
It had a terrible smell when I took it out of the package. The straps broke the first time I used it. There is no support on the bottom of the bag so my dog did not like sitting in it,0
my cats dropped these in their water bowl and the coloring ran in the water....,0
"Had to return this product.  I received the wrong color and also the main (larger) container had a crack in the bottom.  I did not ask for a replacement product, just a refund.",0
"As a vet tech with tens years experience it is my opinion that this is the worst dog food on the market. Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills.",0
"I have 2 dogs, but neither of them will try it. Wasted money. ",0
"Beautiful fabric, but the clip doesn't stay together.",0
This is perfect for my small dog.  It keeps the leash from getting tangled underneath her feet and it means I don't have to attach the least to her collar on her neck.,1
"I was really excited to get this ornament for my fish tank. However, the outer paint falls in water. Now, large areas of the ornament are exposed.  If I could, I would return this item and get a full refund. As beautiful as it is, avoid this product!!!! It is a waste of money.",0
nice little,1
"I have 2 boxers I purchase the muzzled for. I am unable to use the muzzle on either dog. One dog, it started to rub the fur off of his face. The other dog, there was no way to keep the muzzle on him. He would have it off in less than five minutes",0
This car seat is perfection. My 9 lb Pomeranian sits in it comfortable and can even lay down. I love that she can see over when sitting but when she lays down she can peek at me through the mesh sides. So far it's holding up well. Great purchase!,1
"Much cheaper elsewhere. If I had known, I would have bought it. Not a good value",0
"the first time I purchased this product I was impressed. My cat is allergic to pine and and several other products. She was fine with the Cedar and it really masked the smells. I was happy to walk into my one bedroom apt and smell cedar vs. cat urine.

Unfortunately, this last bag was a different product all together. It was just plain old saw dust. It is different in color and there is no cedar smell. So now I come home to the smell of saw dust and urine.

I have used a green tea cat litter in the past which was great but very pricey. I may bite the bullet and go back to that.

Bummer. Consistency is tops in my book - with any product.",0
my dogs love these cookies,1
"When first giving this food to my cat, he developed ""runny"" bowels so I stopped the cisapride and enulose.  We did well for 4 months and then the cat became impacted.  Now I give the oral cat medicine as needed (as determined by bowels).  And the cat is happy, hunts, purrs and so far so good.  This is a godsend as the cat hates oral medicines and hides and throws up and so on and just the medicine alone resulted in an expensive visit to the vet a couple of times a year and a very sick cat.  What a difference this cat food has made.  Interestingly the vet said it shouldn't make a difference.  But it has made a big difference.  :)

What initially convinced me to try this product from Amazon were the customer reviews.",1
The catnip pellets must be low-grade-- my cats had no interest whatsoever!,0
"This was our first go round at natural litter. I did quite a bit of research however opinions are always so varied on natural litter. It smelled pretty good when I poured it into the litter box but very quickly the room it was in smelled of poop, even when the cat was covering her business and even after I scooped it the smell lingered. If you have a very well ventilated room and you don't mind scooping on the daily then perhaps this might work for you. We switched to World's Best and I am a convert. Wont go back to clay or this walnut brand.",0
"very difficult to set it, i returned it",0
"As soon as we opened this bag of food we noticed that it smelled different.  I wish that I would have trusted my gut and returned this product at once.  Both of my cats lost a significant amount of weight within weeks of eating from this bag.  I fear that if we would have continued feeding it to them, they could have died.  Don't buy your pets food from this source!  It's worth it to buy from a store you trust and pay a few more dollars, so you can know that you are getting quality food.",0
Broke the same day i got it. Dog ran and all the line went twith him....,0
One of the FEW cat foods left that have actual MEAT as the first ingredient!  A good food for the price and my multiple cat household loves it.,1

"Chipped teeth are a real potiental risk with this bone! I wanted to leave a review in hopes of saving one fur baby from having as bad of a chipped tooth as my pug had from this bone. I would definitely say hes not an agressive chewer, but he does enjoy bones. The vet later told me ($220 later after a tooth extraction) that these type of nylon bones frequently chip dogs teeth and to steer clear of them. Look for bones/chews that are VOHC accepted.",0
"I hate two pits and this dog food gave both of the horrible diarrhea and gas that can clear a room. It also made my female vomit. I was in total disbelief that it was the food, but 2 days after I changed their food, they were both fine. VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!!!",0
"Very economical to buy in this quantity.  We have small dogs (13-18lbs) who get treats whenever they potty or go into their crates, so we actually break them in half.  Our dogs love them.",1
"This is a really great cage, its really big for the price, the only problem I had with it was the front door latch does not work, it gets stuck and I can't ever open it or close it, so that's the only defect that I have with mine..I don't know if its common..its unfortunate though...I have to have a battle with the cage every time, thankfully, there is a door on the top of the cage also.",1
The cleaning pads are very small.  I have to use at least 3 to 4 to clean one ear on my dog.  I won't buy this product again,0
terrible. do not buy.  does not work. TEACH your dog to not jump.  I have three dogs that do not jump because I never let them.  I now have a foster dog I was hoping for a quick fix.  DID NOT WORK ON HIM.  I just started treating the foster like my own and he now does not jump on anyone.,0

"Great for my older dog with a coughing / trachea problem. He could no longer wear a leash around his neck. This is perfect! Easy to get it on Him.

Unfortunately it's past the return window so nowhere to go on this but to throw away and try something else.",0

our very tiny less than 8 pound shipoo puppy was able to chew his way out of this cheaply made playpen twice.,0
Does a really good job cleaning.,1
"Buying Nylabones for my dog has always been tricky; he's very hot/cold with which he likes. Some shapes he loves, while others he just won't touch. I never understand it, but he's always seemed to love this shape. I think the 3 prongs make it more interesting from him than the standard straight bone.",1
"A great cat tree, very sturdy, easy to assemble. I put this tree together by myself in less than 2 hours!

"I'm 5'6 and can sit up right, legs stretched out, in this thing no problem. Bought for boxer dog, currently a puppy, this thing is like a master suite for him. Seems sturdy enough but puppy isn't big enough to try to break out yet.",1
"Lasted One month, then died.",0
"I should've paid closer attention to the dimensions, my fault.. I have a German shepherd and it's just to small for him..",0
"I strongly suggest not to buy it. There is a brush at the opening that throw food to the pond. In tow weeks the brush lost its arms and became flat. I still have it, if you are interested just arrange a pick up to see what I mean. Free to pick up.
DO Not But.",0
Love it!,1
I bought this and realized that it is completely unnecessary. I have a screen terrarium and it is unusable. I suppose it would work better for glass tanks.,0
"my dog destroys every toy he gets, even the traditional KONG indestructible, but this ball has lasted.  He wants to play fetch with it but it is too heavy for throwing around.  Still a great purchase, keeps him busy!",1
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS TO DEAL WITH.  IF YOU WANT TO RETURN IT, GOOD LUCK TRYING  FOLD THIS PRODUCT BACK IN TO THE BOX, IT ASSEMBLES TERRIBLY AND I NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED WITH ONLINE PURCHASE, EVER",0
Worked just fine.,1
As expected. Well received by pets.,1
IT IS A DOG KENNEL. IT'S PINK AND IT DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO. WE HAVE NO COMPLAINTS AND IT SETS UP EASILY.,1
Dog likes very much,1
"Bizzare product, not sharp at all, just crushed and splintered my Bulldogs nail.",0
Thus has become one of our dogs favorite toys.  Very durable with plenty of squeekers.,1
"Too big, too thin, too sharp. I will not put this on my cats collar because it will hurt her.",0
These filters work perfectly and were delivered as promised.,1
Too small and dinky my husband found one for the same price BIGGER....My 2 year old nephew plays with it....its like TOY sized,0
"As other buyers have said, this will work on the junk in some pets ears, and it won't work on other junk.  It all depends on what particular type of nastiness is growing in there.  It worked great in clearing the nasty brown junk out of my German Shepherds ear.

The directions, however, aren't the best.  The directions say not to clean the junk out of the pets ears first, that leaving it in will help the treatment work better.  It didnt.  As long as there was a buildup of junk in my boys ear, the treatment did nothing.  Once I cleaned all the junk out, using an ear rinse and cotton balls, the treatment worked within a few days.

All in all, I am very pleased.  Using this treatment saved me an expensive trip to the vet.  Will it work for you?  Again, it all depends on whats growing in your pets ears.  Shy of a trip to the vet, there is really no way of knowing.",1
"My dogs love it!
But it split in half nine days after they got it, so thats a bummer. They are labs and like to chew on toys aggressively. I was hoping this would last longer.",0
"Tom (cat), 15 plus pounds and 12 years old, enjoyed sitting on the hammock before tree was even put together (see photo). He has ventured to next to the top surface once and on various levels since, peering out the window. He loves to use the big scratching post at the bottom and often sleeps near the tree. It's a handsome piece of ""furniture!""",1
My puppy loves this! Sure helped with his teething and saved us from not having to deal with chewed up furniture.,1
For very small dog,0
"My 6 month old Golden had soft stools and we tried everything to help her (probiotics, antibiotics etc).  Finally weaned her off of this and onto another brand and now she's fine.",0
Extremely thin and not comfy,0
"I give it to my adult cats and kittens. Their coats have become very nice and shiny, along with them having more energy.",1
These were recommended to me for my goldendoodle who has a medium thick wavy coat. They're awful. It's like trying to cut her fur with a butter knife. They are quite loud. They're seriously lacking power. They get very hot very fast. My cheapo clippers from Wal-Mart work better than these clippers. If you want a professional looking cut either go to a groomer or get a better set of clippers.,0
These r great toys!!! I hide treats in the flaps and folds. They r great enrichment toys. I only buy planet pleasure toys for my birds. ,1
I have used this as directed for 3 days in a row. My cats are not phased by it at all. They are still clawing at my furniture. I just bought a new leather couch and hoped this would be a great solution to break their bad habit but sadly it was not. I now have claw marks all over the back of my new sectional.,0
Cute design but too bulky to have dangling on leash. Also was kind of hard to pull out the bags.,0
$107???!? HAHAHAHAHAHA,0
I have purchased six of these pads in 4 years and rotate them.  This one clearly smell of plastic and our 4 year old shit-zhu will not use it.,0
"This product never worked.  When I tried to manually open it, the right side did not open properly, and would fall down, which could hit your pet in the head, if it worked at all.  I set it and it never opened for several days. Don't buy this product.",0
"They did not come with instructions and I was clueless why there was a strange strap in them. Finally, I figured it out that it was a chin strap after reading a review so I sat here with them in my dog until I figured out how to use it. I have an 18-20 lb shorkie and there is quite a bit of excess strap so I deducted one star. They fold in half at the nose for easy storage. Unless I can figure out how to make the excess strap less then I probably wouldn't purchase these again because they're too big and you can see all the slack in one of my pics. It just hangs behind his ears.",1
Unhappy with this harness.  Had a med size--too small; got a large size and that was so big and clunky.  Not suitable for a Scottie.  Not going to shop for a harness on line ever again.,0
very easy to work and maintain no worries of it stopping.,1
"Delivery was prompt (6days) after ordered.  However there was no direction on how to attach it to the faucet.  The pictures on the package show which end to attach to the faucet but I can't get it to attach to my (ordinary) kitchen faucet.  I need instruction, please!",0
"Frankly, my kitty did not like it at all.",0
"the bag works fine for a medium size dog easy to tie a knot on the end , a larger dogs  ***p may make it harder to tie the knot and stay clean .  Only my guess .",1
Worked perfectly,1
Not designed as stated. Broke.,0
"We actually love this collar for our dogs. We got two different sizes as one dog is larger than the other. Very sturdy, which is crucial for terriers!",0
"Quality seems okay. It's definitely soft, but the dimensions are very wrong.  This item is actually 40X24X4 inches. Not 41X27X4 inches. The shortage of inches makes this useless with my foam dog bed.",0
I purchased this for our dogs when we relocated to Florida. We endured a 27 hour drive with this container and bowls and recommend them for any dog owner. Excellent product!,1
My older cats were not impressed and I ended up sending it to a relative with much younger cats. No feedback yet.,0
"These are cheap because they're junk. They do not make a clean cut. Like others said, the are loose and cannot be tightened. Human nail clippers work better on my cat than these. These leave his nails cracked and frayed. Waste of money.",0
"My dog is a Golden Chow, she's a medium sized dog that's a good biter and has destroyed many toys. We've had this duck for a few weeks right now and she's like a baby with its first blanket, she loves this toy. She's always playing with it, and has not had ripped at all. For someone with a dog that's a strong biter, and need something to keep their dog  occupied for sometime during the day, I would strongly suggest this toy.",1
Awesome gut loaded worms,1
My cat would not eat these therefore I do not know if they actually work. He is not typically picky about food or treats therefore I would not recommend these at all,0
"This is a sturdy and roomy cage. It was difficult to put together, though. Several bent bard and the top took forever to fit together because the sides were warped outwards. Once it was assembled though, it fit together well and holds well. Good cage, but be prepared to struggle with assembly.",1
"I used to give it to my dog years ago and they were kind of chewy, so it would take days for my dog (red Heeler mix, to give an idea of the teeth size/strength) to finish it. However, these one were brittle and in few hours they were gone. I guess the recipe changed.",0
"I purchased this for my 2 cats.
The only positive is that it does automatically dispense the food.
Now for the negatives
---the clear plastic container is very cheap. It is a little bit stronger then a 12oz bottle of water. The plastic is very thin, bendable and cheap.
--- there is no point to advertise that there is a microphone to record a greeting because you cannot understand anything when you plat it back.
---- and my cat can get all the food out of the container by pushing her paw up the shoot. She figured that out in 10 seconds of me putting the feeder on the ground. When I put food in the feeder to fill it some pieces fall out the shoot. If this happens then why am I not surprised that my cat can get all the food out  that she wants.  Last night I put in enough food for 4 feedings and this morning all the food was gone.
-----the feeder is clear which means your pets SEE that there is food in there and they will do whatever they can to get it out.
My cat loves food so she need to be fed at certain times but now she eats 4 meals worth of food in one sitting
If you have very smart cats like mine, pass on this feeder.
This feeder DOES NOT work and I am very disappointed that I wasted $40 on it! Save your money any try another one.",0
"Received it on time, took both of my dogs to a friend's private land, and worked all but 10 minutes and they were both DEAD and that was from a full charge with the green light.. will be returning these, someone else might have better luck with these",0
"Very nice product. Solid, large, but not too heavy, which is nice when you're trying to carry it full of water.",1
"love these, they protect my dog's paws while hiking, they stay on pretty well, my old ones lasted 2 hiking seasons, we go every week during the summer, about 16 hikes a year",1
"My bunny died not long after I put this salt wheel in his cage. This is the only thing I changed about his care. He was only 5 years old, so yhe death was unexpected.",0
These are perfect for our little dog.  Excellent product and service!,1
"I've had this on my lab turned up to the second notch. It seems to shock her when my other dog barks, when she shakes her head, and even shocked my toddler when she picked it up. It is just too sensitive. I've tried both sets of prongs and the lowest setting.",0
This is a crazy bouncing toy. The color makes it easy to find in the yard. The seller was quick to get it to me.,1
"First impression was that the build quality was lacking, the unit feels cheap which it wasn't at $75. When I went to plug in to my power supply and light the DC connectors didn't fit, apparently my power supply, old dimmer, and light have a thicker pin than the ramp timer did, another dig on build quality I suppose. A trip to Radio Shack and a little soldering fixed that and now the ramp timer fits with the rest of my system. Programming is a little difficult as well and I am not quite sure how to get the unit to turn the lights off for a short break in the middle of the day but I have asked current for help on this; let's see if it is even a possibility. Sadly I might switch back to the mechanical timer I had before; $5, full 24 hour programming but no ramp, moonlight, or color mixing. Sad thing is that I probably can't send it back after I switched to the better plugs.",0
"I have bought 20+ of these bones over the last few years.  I have 4 large dogs and they do really enjoy them.  However, I have recently had 2 incidents that alarmed me.  My large standard poodle was choking on a splintered piece from one of these bones.  Thankfully, I was there to removed it from his throat.  These bones are not cheap, but my 4 boys are priceless....I am throwing them out and replacing them with Kong bones and chews and stuffing them with freeze dried liver treats.  Keeps my guys attention and they get the benefits from chewing with out the problems of splintering from the benebones.",0
"This backpack is super cute, brown with a neon orange accent stripe.  But I wanted my dog to carry small water bottles, and the pockets are too small for any standard small bottle.  So, thumbs up for styling but thumbs down for functionality.",0
Didn't really stop my dog from itching.,0
"This came opened and leaking in the package, which is terrible to even touch since the oil is potent and sticky. It doesn't look the same as the product I have recieved before when ordering several times directly from Dr. Mercolas website. This should be an airtight pump, not one that cabn be twisted open like this one. I don't feel safe giving this to my dogs. It went directly into the trash.",0
Great price and great stuff.,1
"This is NOT a large litter pan.  It is tiny and useless.  My cat won't even fit in this thing.  I have a full grown, healthy cat, doesn't anyone actually make a LARGE pan!!!!!",0
"My crazy cat cries for no reason and sprays even though he's fixed. I didn't notice a difference right away, but a wk or 2 in he stopped crying and is spraying less. He just started crying again so I thought it wasn't working, but I checked and realized the diffuser was empty, so I put a new one in and he calmed down again.",1
"Love this box!! My 10 year old can easily use this. The cat and box are her responsibility and she HATED changing and scooping the litter box. She cleaned the litter for the first time and said ""Momma! It is so easy!!"" Highly recommend this box!",1
I bought this to use in addition to my sticker thermometer on the outside of the tank.  It seems pretty accurate and is small and doesn't take up much room. Works great and haven't had any problems with it! I would recommend. Much better than guessing what the temp is based on the liquid crystal sticker thermometer.,1
"I love this product, unfortunately my dog destroys tennis balls. I bought Kong balls also, thinking they would work better (more indestructible) but he just wants to chew the ball up once he catches it. If your dog chews balls up, think twice.",1
heavy duty a large for the dog I have.,1
Just love black and white checks. It is used for my puppy kibble and when she graduates to big girl food I am going to use it as a treat jar. I just I broke the lid....now I will use it for a plant.,1
"Our cat is a spoiled feline so we like to make sure he is eating well. He is an indoor/outdoor cat and quite the mouser, but he prefers to play with his catch and eat the cat food. I think that says a lot about this product. We will continue to buy this as long as we have our furry little friend. If this review was helpful please click that it was!",1
"I have the two-layer cage, and this is my review: It's a high-quality cage for the advanced pocket pet owner, and it's much bigger inside than it appears in pictures and relatively easy to assemble (the instructions are fantastic but it still took me two hours with another pair of hands). It's a bit difficult to assemble if you're a short person like myself, as the stacking of cage levels requires a bit of precision, especially if the parts are warped.

This leads into my next point: it loses a star for the poor shipping and handing (see pictures) and some combination of bad manufacturing or packaging that resulted in nearly every panel having bent pegs and sockets. The bars were evenly spaced and thickly-gauged (meaning my three rats would be sufficiently contained, which is the best quality you can find in a three-rat cage, really)  but we had to manually re-bend the pieces with pliers and a hammer. I expect any person who has this cage shipped to them will deal with this problem, so expect a bit of tweaking on your part.

Some good news: it comes with a handy catalog with part numbers if you need to replace or add cage levels or even individual parts. The bins are NOT chew-proof, as my rats have proven.

It also looks like a good cage for breeding, as there is a hidden hook between the two layers you can use to isolate the levels, using the ramp as a vertical drawbridge. This cage is pretty amazing, but only worth it if you're really committed to the hobby of pocket pet ownership.",1
I have bottom these several times and the last few times the squeaker broke the first day we had it,0
My dog destroyed this in less than 15 mins.,0
"my cat prefers original, he must know it's good for him",1
"I just received my luffy balls. They have only been in the aquarium for 24 hours. So far, so good.",1
"I purchased this product based on the recommendation from Lisa at Fresh Eggs Daily to give to my Khaki ducklings as a niacin supplement. I've put a few tablespoons of the powder in my duck's feed mix ever since they were about a week old and my ducks are growing so well! Their legs and wings are the perfect shape and size, and the ducks themselves now have gorgeous juvenile feathers which are smooth to the touch. My only complaint about this product is the garlic smell; the ducks inevitably get their food soaked with water and it really stinks when I clean the feed dish. But that's a small price to pay for healthy, happy ducks.

I originally bought this in the smaller package but my advice is to go straight for the 5 pound package because it's a better deal and you'll definitely use it all.",1
This food is excellent for my dog.  I feed a combination of this canned food and dry food also by Natural Balance with the same formula.  My dog is specifically allergic to chicken and did not tolerate other types of food very well.  This solved all of our problems.  I highly recommend it.,1
"My cats have always been ambivalent about catnip. Sometimes they'll roll around in it a little, but they've never been crazy about it. I was given a packet of Yeoww! Catnip, and both cats nearly tackled me when I walked through the door. They were climbing all over me, trying to dig through my purse to find the 'nip. All I have to do is rub a little of this stuff on a seldom played-with toy, and it's a new favorite that they carry around all day.",1
Followed the instructions provided but unfortunately this product had no affect whatsoever. My dog is 50 lbs so maybe the product only works for smaller weights despite the description. Very disappointed,0
the conure really loves playing with this. he has the red and green color to a T.  I'm still working on the others,1
I prefer this automatic litter box over the others.  I cant tell you how easy it to have and the upkeep cost is very low.  You can also obtain a hard shell insert instead of using the disposable ones.  I owned this product and ended up going back to this product!,1
"If you really want to get rid of pet stains specially in carpets, my dog had only 5 accidents inside the house until he was potty trained you won't regret it",1
"This product appears to work well in fresh water tanks with a filter and pump. We have a heater in our tank and always notice some gunky stuff as the water evaporates. Using this product eliminated the gunk, but some bubbles and thin film form on the surface some times. This was especially prominent in our betta tank that does not have a filter/pump. Do follow the instructions and start with half dose the first time you use it - otherwise, you will see lots of this film (perhaps the bacteria in this cleaner form this film).",1
I used this unit and after a week it Junk's up inside to were there is no circulation.,0
I love this! So practical - I leave it on my leash and never have to remember to bring poop bags with me because they're always attached! I'm very pleased.,1
"This, combined with bissel oxy boost, has impressively cleaned everything I have tasked it with. Works.",1
Guinea pigs loved it....so much they chewed it.  Going to have to be replaced after only three weeks. Going to try and find something similar that isn't plastic.  The connecting rings are very soft plastic compared to the rest of it.,0
I purchased this ceramic bulb to use in a whelping box to keep puppies warm.  I have had it plugged in for over an hour and it BARELY emits any heat.  I am holding a thermometer 4 inches below the lamp and it is registering 72.  I will be returning it.,0
the glow ball was not very glowy  at night which was the idea of buying the set,0
"Whatever the plastic canvas fabric is made of that covers the pvc frame, it has a horrid chemical smell that will not wash out.  I put the cover outdoors just so I could get away from the smell of it.  I want to like this product though.  I'm hoping that after a week outside, the smell will go away?  If so, then I will come back and improve the rating of this product.",0
"the bottom corner was broken the cage was bent in many places, and one of the ramps clamp was broken and unusable. Not the mention the instructions were not vey clear.  Not happy at all with this product.",0
Runs small,0
I have a short haired cat and I am not able to use this on her. She doesn't like to be brushed and if I use this I have to take out the hair for every stroke - it cleans the hair easy and quick - but takes too much time when you have to do it every few seconds.,0
well made like the brand cat loves it great product!,1
"We have pugs and travel with them frequently. I like the idea of this water bowl, but it is difficult for our dogs to get their snouts to the water. When lying flat the water level doesn't rise very high in the drinking area (to prevent spilling when traveling), so therein lies our only problem with the water bowl. Our dogs can barely get their tongues to the water. When it's upright and full of water (just below the blue drinking area) it has to be wedged between something to prevent water from spilling out. All in all with a different breed of dog I think this travel bowl would be awesome, but with a short-nosed breed I think the only way it would really work for them would be if the depth of the water bowl were reduced? We have occasionally partially-frozen the water in the bowl prior to travel allowly it to slowly melt to keep it cooler for the dogs during warm weather.",1
New user to this feed.  Good price.,1
My dog was prone to extreme plaque buildup and bad breath. Since the last cleaning I have used these chews and her teeth loog great and she does not have bad breath.,1
good stuff,1
Didn't work for my pugs.,0
"I don't know what it is about these things, but my dogs LOVE them so for that reason, they get 5 stars.",1
"This brush has  gotten more hair from my dog in one sitting been every other brush we have combined throughout his life! I am extremely happy, because before no matter how often I brushed him  I would still find hair all over the house.  Many times when I would bet him there would be a few hairs stuck to my hand. No more! This brush is awesome, do not be surprised How much air comes off of your dog.",1
this mask was way too small. The horse size was way too big for my guy as well. It's unfortunate because I really liked their leg wraps.,0
"This baby gate looks like it'd be a good bargain, but the install is much harder than it looks. I am very good at installing things and building things, but I found the instructions almost completely useless and unreadable. I  finally got it installed, but it was definitely tricky! Once it is installed it seems to be okay, but is all the trouble really worth it? I would argue, not. Also, beware of the gate which actually won't latch until you have pressure on it. I swings every which way and can knock into your ribs, head, or fingers. Be cautious of this buy if you are at all easily frustrated with building/installing things for your home!",0
"Works great, just have to titten a little as the ice melts. I don't use the given ice packs.",1
I charged the collar and followed all the instructions and I could never get it to work. Spend a little more money and get something that won't waste your time.,0
"Great design... Lousy reliability!
Purchase this pump about a year ago, it worked well for about eight months, then it got really noisy. I opened it up and found that one of the pump devices diaphragm (it is a dual pump) had a cut in the rubber piece that forms the pump. This after less than year, I had an old pump that lasted more than FIVE years! Very disappointed, I had a good opinion of Tetra products, not any more! Mind you that I was able to remove the broken pump and I am using the remaining one! See how long that one last.",0
"I was trying to find a bird seed to add to my subscribe and save orders so that it is brought right to my door. I did my homework, read the reviews, they were either really good or really bad so thought I'd give it a try. Well, I'm going to have to find something else to add to my subscribe and save! NO BIRDS on the feeder for 3 DAYS NOW. It is still full. It's not my birds either. They are still pouring to the 2 finch feeders and are all over the 2 sunflower seed feeders. I like a mix in the big feeder because it has 8 perches and the ""little"" birds just love it. This brings sparrows; chicadees; finches; wrens; titmouse to name just some of my regular visitors. Not now, nothing will even light on the feeder. I guess I just threw away my money because it's way too heavy to pay shipping back. The seed is a majority of that large round red seed- milo I think.
  I am confused as to how some folks have birds eating this well and are happy then there are so many of us that the birds won't even touch it. Are there different Wagner's establishments that could make such a difference in the contents while packaging it? All I know is I won't buy it again, the proof is in the deserted feeder and it's way too quiet, I miss all the chatter and chirping that the little ones make, so cute how the littlest birds seem to be the loudest and most opinionated. I love it! Not that the cardinals and mockingbirds and blue jays and doves aren't vocal, just the little ones are so full of themselves. I miss them, gotta fix this fast!",0
So much fun for my dogs!,1
"This toy is not as flat (disc-shaped) as I was thinking it would be. Thus, my smallish dog couldn't get the squeek going.  Within a few days, she tore  a little hole on the back of the toy and some stuffing came out. It turned out, this was actually a good thing, because I pulled some stuffing out, stitched the fabric back up, and now it squeks easily and has held up really well even since. So in the end, I'm pretty pleased with this toy.",1
Good stuff. We and the cats all love it. Great clumping and odor control!! Already ordered some more.,1
My two cockatiels are scared to death of this perch. Couldn't get them near it without them flying away. Might work great for other birds but not mine.,0
sorry but this isn't the same mine I was trying to replace had a slit where you control the flow.,0
"The ingredients in this food seem to be really good. With my puppy however, the food hasn't sat well in her stomach. I tried to give it to her for about 2 or 3 weeks and she didn't love it, would leave alot on her plate, sometimes it was noticable that she didn't feel well after eating it, and this food smells really bad. It left a bad breath smell in her mouth no matter how many times I brush her teeth. I'm disappointed bc I bought alot, and still have half of what I bought left. Not sure what to do with it..",0
"Due to the shape - not round but egg shaped, it does not roll. Dogs not interested in playing with it even with kibble inside",0
"I've got four healthy active young cats...do the math.

I will absolutely never use anything other than a metal scooper.  The are durable, cleaner, and just plain better at getting those more difficult deposits out of the litter.",1
My dog and my cat find these egg-straordinarily delicious. They both come running when they hear the package and I'd say they would definitely cross a road for them. It's a huge bag making it a hen-sane value.,1
it  didn't fit,0
Love them! Perfect size to carry around. Great purchase,1
Too tall,0
The bumpers can't be installed correctly and don't allow for the door in the gate to open. Poor design.,0
My dog loves this bed and it's very soft and comfortable for her. Glad I picked this bed. No problems so far.,1
"My two Goldens LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this toy! We've had it for almost a year and it has held up great! A couple of the squeakers have been punctured by teeth and don't work anymore, but that doesn't stop them from playing with it. They enjoy playing tug of war with it, and the puppy practically prances as she drags the poor snake up the stairs each night. She smacks herself in the head as she shakes it all around. It's hysterical to watch! This is by far their favorite toy and it gets much use every day. It's much more durable than any other dog toy we've had.",1
"Kinda of a cheap toy, pomeranian destroyed in minutes",0
"This product did not do anything it claimed it would. Did not stop itching, scratching or kill fleas.  As a consumer and ASPCA member, I do not recommend this product to any dog owner. This purchase was a total waste of my money.",0
"Scissors seem to be very good quality, sharp, very nice case. Finger holes are a bit on the small side for a man, but useable, may remove rings. Highly recommended",1
"Works great, my Bischon has always had an ear infection even when I keep his hair short. I did this for 7 days as instructed and all clear. Best Stuff ever.",1
"This is a great little pet ""house.""  It was simple to set up--zips open and closed on each end, comes with a carrying case, and even has ""tent"" stakes for outdoor use.  I'll be using it for a lengthy road trip with a cat, and it should work perfectly.  It's very roomy inside, and the side windows can open or close depending on the cat's state of mine.  The fleece pad is nice.",1
Our rescue Saint doing very well on this food!,1
Worked great!,1
All the grain in this food makes it not good for my Westie. Her feet have turned brown from incessant licking due to allergy to grain. Switching back to grain free today!!!,0
"They love them, I give it to all 3 of my dogs.",1
"I' am happy with this booster seat for my dog. She loves it, no more crying in the car. Thank you",1
"My african grey loves these toys. He seems to use the entire toy--once he's done destroying the bells, he moves on the the center wood design and chews that up. I get much more use out of these toys than most that I buy for him. Great design!",1
Best product for regular ear care of our dogs. Gentle enough that they don't try to pull away and smells fresh! I used to use apple cider vinegar but glad to have a natural but more effective product!,1
Very disappointed that these treats are made in China.  Too bad because the actual toys the treats go in are great.,0
"Bought for very large emaciated rescue dog.  He was unsure of his footing on the mesh so I added a blanket, and he is so much more comfortable.  Has to be much less painful on prominent bones vs. floor, and low elevation means it is easy for him to get up on this cot.  Size is great, price is good, free 2 day shipping cannot be beat.",1
Nice sweater but sizing not accurate--it wasn't long enough.,0
"This collar has been very helpful with my large standard poodle mix who was inclined to chase joggers and running children. I've had the collar for two and a half years now and have only ever used the shock 3 or 4 times, as my dog instantly learned to respond to the warning tone.  The collar allows me to maintain control over him remotely, so that he can be happily off leash.  What prompted me to write this review so long after purchasing the collar is the great customer service at Innotek.  I lost the remote soon after getting the collar and they replaced it free, then just recently the collar stopped holding a charge and they are sending me a new one for $45 under the limited lifetime warranty, all just with an easy phone call.",1
Broke a couple months after purchasing. It no longer pulls enough water from the tank to filter back in out the top.,0
"I wanted to love this litter, with all the rave reviews and price I thought it would be a miracle litter, but was very disappointed. It is similar to Swheat Scoop but not nearly as odor absorbent. It clumps decent (nothing like the video I saw) but it does nothing for the smell of either urine or feces, I ended up mixing it with Blue Buffalo litter to use the rest of the bag. It didn't have any dust and the cats seemed to prefer using this, but it just did not do anything for the smell, especially if it went longer than a day without being scooped. Also I ignored all the complaints about it tracking, since I had the boxes on a large piece of outdoor carpeting, however, after removing it to hose off, I now understand why there are so many people commenting about it. They kicked it everywhere outside of the box. It stuck to the bottom of my feet and the cats paws, I found pieces of litter everywhere in the house. Definitely not worth the price.",0
No more murdered tennis balls around my house. Roxy loves this toy =-),1

Perfect size for my pug,1
Very thin and cheap,0
"The bag holder works well, but the lid is very heavy for the machine to lift and it gets stuck often as a result.  I just use the bag-it, which works wonderfully.",1
"I liked the initial idea of this light mimicking freshwater fish natural lighting. However, this light never fully shuts off at night time like it should which is one of the things I didn't like about this light.  Instead it cycles through a few different colors for some odd reason (colors that water never has shining on it at night time like reds and greens...) when all my other led lights on my other tanks shut off at night time or they have the moonlight on then shut off. Also the remote battery died pretty quickly (with very little use) and now does not seem to work after I spent $5 on the exact type of battery that was in it. Overall I am looking for a new light to replace this one with soon as it makes algae go nuts in my tank.",0
"My cats will not walk on this mat. They don't like the way it feels beneath their paws. It is rather hard. Also does not handle easily. You have to have a large area to maneuver it so the litter doesn't fall all over the floor. Found nice mats at TJ Max. And the great part about them they were made in the USA, not assembled but made in the USA from recycled plastic. The top of the mat is soft and the bottom is durable plus they were less money.",0
"My bird has always enjoyed these little huts but I will never purchase one again!!!!  I went in to awaken her and found her ""stuck"" to the hut.  A string from the hut had become wrapped around her neck.  It was horrifying!!!  She had beaten her wings trying to free herself and there were feathers everywhere.  Fortunately, my bird was still alive when I found her and she recovered.  When I purchased this.....I read the review about a bird who had hung itself and thought....""My bird has had dozens and dozens of these, she even chews the bottom out, and we have never had a problem.""

Don't let the fact that your bird hasn't had any close calls make you think ""Oh, that won't happen to my bird!!""  In less than five minutes your bird could be dead all because of a sleeping hut that they didn't need and won't miss if they don't have.  Yes, it's cute to find them lying in it in the morning with their cute little bird feet sticking out but it's simply not worth the risk.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!",0
Can't see water level inside. Almost impossible to get all the water out.,0
"These ""large"" liners don't fit my large cat box. These liners are better for small or medium litter boxes.",0
Came broken,0
"I have owned four of these lights for about 4 years now. I did a lot of research before I purchased these and was initially happy with my purchase. LED's are the way to go, I can put on one heck of a show with these lights (and the others that I own) running off a single outlet. I took excellent care of these lights and only moved them about 12 times total (always using original boxes/packaging). Two of my fixtures have rows of LED's that are not working, probably the result of poor solder points, not LED's that have burned out (they had not been moved for months when the LED's went out so they were not damaged from moving them, they just quit working and they have only been used for a TINY fraction (about 1000 hours)of their advertised LED life). I have since purchased several other par 64 LED fixtures (which are Red Green Blue and White) which perform better as far as light output and the white LED's are a great addition. I chose the ADJ fixtures expecting better reliability but it ends up the cheaper knockoff brand lights I got are apparently built as well and cost me less than half as much. If the ADJ lights are not going to be of considerably higher quality it makes no sense to buy them considering what else is out there.",0
Lasted less than 5 mins. My Lab chew a whole right in it. See picture.,0
"I purchased the replacement kit thinking it was a universal fit for various Resco clippers, but to my dismay I was wrong. This kit wouldn't allow the blade to fully extend in order to trim the nails. Now I have to purchase another clipper, very dissapointed that this wasn't explained as a possibility.",0
"I was expecting something totally different.. It's SO loud and the skirt is so heavy that the stick gets stuck under it sometimes. Also, you can't even see the end of the stick outside the skirt, it's all the way covered. Paid about $20 and it wasn't even worth $5..... My cats hate it and are scared of the noise, although one of my cats just plays with the stick if it is detached..",0
"Purchased this specifically for the D ring shown in the picture so I could clip on a leash. It just arrived and super disappointed. No D-ring. Same quality and security as the Garmin collar I'm currently using. Total waste of money.

Wish the picture was accurate.",0
"Looks cool , but doesnt stay on out german shepherds head, no instructions are included",0
Such a great addition! Our dog never comes in and night anymore she's so comfortable. Which keeps the other critters away from our yard and chickens! Wonderful.,1
These are not heavy duty trimmers.  They pinched the nail and did not cut.  Not impressed nor was my medium sized dog.,0
"I am so glad I bought this case. I got the purple one and the color is beautiful.  It arrived very well packaged and on time.  The case arrived in excellent condition.
It's very well padded and has foam inserts for your clipper, blades, combs and tubes of oil or whatever you may wish to put inside. I do wish it was a little bit larger inside, but having said that I am able to fit my Andis Clippers, Andis attachment combs, blades and 2 tubes of oil inside of it with the case able to close perfectly. I feel that my tools are very well padded and protected inside and they do not slide around.
The case is very sturdy, but not heavy to hold.  I just love it! Money well spent and I am so glad I bought it to protect my grooming tools. I highly recommend buying this case.",1
"Soft and my cat seems to enjoy, though it's not as plush as it appears in the photo.",1
Good stuff,1
The price went sky high when the reviews were good. Not worth it now. So disappointed with price hike.,0
Small sits nicely in the back of my tank.  My fishies are all nice and cozy warm. :-),1
"The dog is an aggressive chewer but he didn't put a dent in this toy.  We put a treat inside and it kept him occupied for an hour, until he finally got all of the treat out.",1
Didn't work at all but the yard smelt great,0

Great dog food.,1
"Love this portable kennel.  easy to put up, light and roomy.  Great travel kennel",1
"I have become very skeptical of potty pads as I have paid a lot of money at pet stores. You would think they would have the best potty pads. And, they end up being the worst I've ever bought.
I was buying potty pads at Costco then they switched to their own private label, Kirkland Signature. The quality was very disappointing. On my quest for finding new potty pads that actually absorb - what a concept- I ran across these and they ship Amazon Prime.
THESE ARE THE BEST POTTY PADS I HAVE FOUND - they absorb, dry quickly, don't drip urine when taking to the garbage, and, have enough weight that they don't float around and get twisted up before your dog gets a chance to even make use of them.",1
Kitten not very interested in it even when rolled to him.,0
"Do not, I repeat, do not buy the Eclipse six aquarium at all costs!!  It's total garbage and the light will malfunction in short order.  Like an idiot, I bought three (or was it four) hoods that all went to heck in a handbasket.  The lamp may or may not have been part of the problem and I don't know for sure but the Eclipse six is poorly designed in so many ways I could go on and on and on...",0
"This is not sized identically to other Blueberry Pet products. The M was far too small and tight on my 11lb cat, but the L was by far too big - the head-hole made it easy for Shiro to simply walk out of the sweater. It is unlined and the hem is not properly attached, so it looks like there is a second, ruffly tier after the bottom ends. All in all, I was disappointed in the quality of this product from an otherwise decent brand.",0
The seal was broke open on the jar.  I will not give my pet medication that isn't sealed from the factory.,0
"In my initial review (below), I was concerned because the collar I had just opened had a strong and unpleasant smell.  However, that appears to have been an isolated incident.  I contacted Meridian Animal Health (the manufacturer), and they could not have been more helpful.  They immediately sent a replacement collar and arranged for me to send in the defective item.  The two collars I have used most recently have been fine, and my cat is doing well.  She has IBD and vomits much less with the NurtureCalm collar.  It has improved her quality of life, and I will continue to use it.

I have been considering giving the collar a 5-star review.  I have used it with good success with my 15-year old cat for almost a year.  However, I have just opened a new box, and I was almost knocked down by the smell.  I either have a defective collar, or the manufacturers have added a strong, unpleasant, perfume-y odor.  I can smell it from across the room, and I can't imagine that Truffles likes having it right under her nose.  I have left a message with the manufacturer and emailed my vet to try to determine what is going on, and I will update this review once I get some information.  In the meantime, please be aware that you may not be getting the product you know and love.",1
It was a gift for my girlfriends cat,1
held up to two macaws fairly well,1
sadly the blades were dull and no better than the one I was replacing.,0
These bowls were exactly what I needed and arrived promptly!,1
Was expecting it to last a bit longer.gave it to my dogs Christmas morning left for about an hour and came home to it shredded all over the yard. Probably ok for some dogs but not if they are chewers.,0
"I've found that it does relieve my dog's itching, however I am having to bathe my dog more frequently than I'd like because he has developed doggy dandruff and his fur gets a bit oily in between washes more so than before using this shampoo.",1
"When this arrived and I unwrapped it so I could assemble the fountain, I found that the basin (white part that holds the water) was full of dust/ dirt and pet hair. It was obviously a used item, which it DID NOT state in the item description. I think that is false advertising, and I'm very disappointed, as friends had recommended I get one of these fountains for my cat. I strongly recommend that other buyers look elsewhere for this.",0
Wasn't a good idea. Should have returned already but have put them away and can't find them.,0
"My cat did not like them at all, gave a few to a friend and his cat did not care either.",0
Very disappointed. I purchased 3 of these. I have 2 different bunny cages and a hamster. These literally fell apart in my hand upon opening. Truly not happy. Complete and total waste of money.,0
"I bought this fountain to encourage my cats to drink more water. I've had this fountain for more than a year. I found out one of my cats likes to wash her face at the fountain and leaves cat hairs in it. The filter does not do a good job filtering out debris and leaving the water clean. After one day, the water would have specks of lint and cat hair swimming around in it. I refill the water daily because it evaporates overnight but refilling does not get rid of the grim that builds up in the grooves of the fountain.

I found out to properly maintain it, I had to take the whole fountain apart and scrub it down with pipe cleaners and my dish wand at least twice a week, sometimes more. If I don't do this, the grim eventually turns black and grudge and mold builds up INSIDE the pump. I've also had to replace the filter multiple times because it would eventually grow some pink/beige looking bacteria! If you don't clean it twice a week, running the motor will make the water DIRTIER than just leaving it in the bowl. This will make your pets sick.

Maintaining this really too much work; it is like keeping a fish tank.  I am just going to go back to a regular water bowl because that's easier to clean everyday and refill with fresh water.",0
broke while installing it in the back seat of my avalanche. poor quality,0
AWESOME,1
"WHY ARE ONLY CERTAIN MOTHER HUBBARD ITEMS AVAILABLE FOR SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE?????  THIS IS STUPID.  I SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY ALL OF MY DOGS' TREATS AT THE SAME PLACE.  THEY'RE AVAILABLE ON AMAZON, WHY ISN'T THE SUBSCRIBE & SAVE OPTION APPLICABLE TO ALL OF THEM?????",0
This is my 2nd cake I've ordered. I get them for my dogs birthday. Super easy to make. People can eat it too but it's not as good as the real thing. I put peanutbutter in a baggie and decorated the cake as well.,1
Clever costume idea but the design made it very difficult to keep on the dog.  Shifted sideways every few minutes and the shrimp kept falling out.,0
I was wanting a chewable table for a small dog. But they might be good for a big dog.,0
"Smells nice, makes a mess of her hair. I should have gotten the spray. Also, I didn't see where this had Shea butter until I received it. I'm  very allergic to it. They still had fleas.",1
At first I wasn't sure if it would absorb as well as the Four Paws that I normally purchase. It felt thinner but we're halfway through the box and each and every one has worked like a charm! I think it works better than Four Paws- I've seen better results with leakage and I feel like it absorbs a lot more. My puppy's a picky one and she doesn't like a dirty pad but this one absorbs so much and she still goes on it! I'll definitely purchase again when I'm running out.,1
Too small of can for money and it didn't seem too bother my puppy at all.,0
This is not a good aquarium. First of all for the price...It is $25 down the drain. The  filter is entirely too big for this aquarium.  There is way too much suction and the fish get sucked in and die. It is plastic and dark. There is no light. It is way too small for more than one fish. And forget about putting any decor in here. Only one thing will fit. Look further than this piece of plastic junk.,0
"My 87 lb. pit bull looked awesome in this lion mane !! Only problem was that it didn't stay put. It constantly fell around his head no matter how I tied it. Too bad, because it looked so good on my dog",1
"The info on this product says it is ""drip less"" and ""odor less.""  Thought this meant 100% free of the drip and smell.  Actually, since the description is two words (dripless instead of drip less), it didn't mean there was no drip or smell.  So back it went as neither my dog nor I liked the smell.  Caveat emptor.",0
"Product did not work at all.  There was no change in my dog's skin condition, and  I do not recommend this product.",0
Owned this for almost 2 months now and it's still like new. My dog used to try and bite through the leashes but she no longer does with the metal chain. Some people say it's heavy but I say it's made well! The weight is not an issue for me or my dog. The handle is sturdy and a little padded which is nice when she tries to get all those squirrels running loose in the neighborhood. I am very happy with my purchase.,1
"First Alert Bark Trainer
Received the trainer and at first I was a little disappointed as when I went to try it in my dog it didn't have any effect on at all - kept barking like anybody's business.  I was ready to pack it up and return it to Amazon but I figure - let's try it one more time.  Well don't ya know - the dog started barking and I hit the button, crossing my fingers it would work.  Well the dog wasn't phased, continuing to bark.  But the instant I hit the button my wife let out a little ""uuurrrrppp"" and immediately sat down on the floor in a kneeling position.  Right at that moment I knew this trainer was a keeper.  I'm already using it to get her to instantly respond to ""go fetch the paper"", and ""go fetch my slippers"",  Nice!
The tricks I can get her to do with this gadget are endless.  I got a few commands I'll work on next and I'll share them, with an update to this review.  Some have me getting rather excited.",1
"sizing was way off, gave them to a friend for their dog. way too small. Printed a size chart and put paw on, not sure what went wrong.",0
"LOVE this cover!
It protects the whole seat and because it hooks to the front and back headrest no pet can sneak into the front seats.",1
This sweater is very cute and fits my puppy nicely. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because there's no opening in the back for an easy leash connection.,1
"I bought these stairs for my ageing some what overweight, ok she's over weight standard dachshund. Angel is 8 1/2 years old and was having difficulty jumping (which she really shouldn't do) up onto the couch. She weighs about 20 pounds plus, should be around 18 pounds, but ya know.. These stairs are fantastic! Angel who is a ""mature/senior"" dog was able to adapt to them easily. I basically bribed her with treats up the steps the first couple of times and she figured it out pretty quick, she is definatly a treat driven hound. Even when she thought she might want to jump, I just pointed to the stairs and said use the stairs sister!! She now uses them with no problem. I love how they have the felt on the stairs so there is no slipping and Angel feels secure when going up/down the steps. They look great and are well built, all wood, no plastic. This is a great to have with small dogs and honestly wish I had bought them years ago. Well worth the money, especially since back surgery for a dachshund it $3000.00 and up. I would absolutly recommend these stairs to anyone with a small dog or even cat, because as they age they have a harder time as well.",1
I like that you get to pick the shape that you want. If my baby gets out people will know where she belongs.,1
Flap broke at the hinge point after about a year.  Replacement flap was just as bad.,0
It's a cheap product. Ripped at the zipper after a month of use.,0
cats don't like them,0
"Only used this once but my puppy's ears did not like it! She wimpered, they got sore and red...I followed directions very carefully, since this is not my first time treating ear mites...I will not be using this stuff again. It's better than other stuff that I've had pets react immediately too, but it's just too harsh, even when you go easy.",0
"For the first couple of years, this was a decent cage. It does seem to keep the mess in well, for a cage without seed guards. There is plenty of room for a small bird and all his/her toys, and it's not bad to look at. However, the tray and grate are hard to get back in after cleaning, and the whole set up is squeaky and wobbly. If your bird gets upset during cleaning, feeding, and so on (as many of them do) every time you do anything to care for him it will wiggle all over and be an unsettling thing, not at all pleasant. My poor bird clings to the perch for dear life every day during feeding.

The plastic dishes stain over time and it does not clean as easily once it's a few years old. Too many nooks and crannies for stuff to eventually get stuck in.  And maybe my lovebird is a little more rowdy than others, I don't know, but she has broken off most of the little plastic tabs that hold the cage together. She likes to tap on the bars with her beak to get my attention. Needless to say, she can beat her way right out of the thing if she gets it in her head to do so. Not cool.

One reviewer said it was their bird's second cage (for vacations or whatever) and it really would be good for that. But if it's their primary residence I'd consider it a starter home because your bird should outlive it.",0
"Very big for my one hamster, very nice cage",1
"Didn't purchase from Amazon.  Received from a friend who couldn't get it to work and couldn't find the recipt and instructions. Maybe not complicated if it works, but who doesn't have instructions on the internet or someone answering the phone for problems or simply returns phone calls. I have many aquariums will make sure to stay clear away from this brand.",0
"Sorry, didn't help my little baby what so ever",0
"We use this cat door to let the cats into a closet with their litter box.  Even though it doesn't have a door or flap over it like some other cat doors, I don't notice any smells intruding into the next room (which is our living room, so I'd notice).  My two cats, each of which is 12 pounds, have no problems going in or out, and the brush collects plenty of fur, which just means less for me to pick up somewhere else.",1
Stupid thing fell apart after one day. Then all the pieces were lost in the bedding.,0
Dog loves product. It is made in China so I do not buy it anymore. Wish it were made someplace else. I do not trust the company's oversight. The company is not user friendly either. The product is expensive.,0
"Maybe if there were better instructions then I could get this thing on my poor anxious dog who is freaking out because of the fireworks and the fact that I keep trying to get this dang thing around him! Today is New Years Eve and this just showed up about two hours ago, I've been trying to get this on him but the instructions are terrible. I'll update if I ever get it on him... Here's an idea, A VIDEO LINK WITH SOMEONE SHOWING HOW ONE PUTS THIS ON THEIR DOG!!! Crazy thought, I know. Why do something like that when you can just terrify the already anxious dog?",0
Garbage! All it does is create a filmy residue on the carpet no matter how many times you rinse it off. Could not understand the slippery feeling on my floors.....I was tracking the  stupid Oxy. BTW- stains are are alive and well.,0

"Nice looking, good quality, quite sturdy, the dog seems comfortable in it.  I would have appreciated a zippered top to load the pet through the top, rather than just the end panel.  My dog is not a chewer, however some pets may chew the lightweight screen panels.  More stylish than the usual pet carriers.",1

"When ordering (25 Dec) this items there was nothing listed as or said about holiday closers or delays in shipping. In fact the confirmation email sent said:

The only part that held up and is used frequently is the little brush to get in a tight corner. We threw away the other ones. Try just putting the whole thing in a dishwasher and thoroughly rinsing out the black motor. Works better and saves money.,0

The seller made it right by sending me a second square in exchange for giving a five star review.",1

"I love this filter! I does a great job filtering my tank. Being able to adjust the flow rate is very handy. The instructions for assembling it were a little unclear. It took us quite a few tries to get it all together correctly. The instructions seemed to assume that some of the pieces were already assembled, but were not. Other than that, once we had it assembled correctly it started working within 20 seconds.",1
"This bed appears a little smaller than what I imagined. It is 20""x16"" when stretched out, but for some reason, it doesn't fit my pups crate (24""x17.5"") as well as I hoped like our previous bed did. And both beds are almost exact measurments. But it does seem made pretty well. It's soft, cute, and seems sturdy. I'm happy with it and so is my morkie pup. He's almost 15 weeks old and 3lbs 9oz. He fits in it perfectly. It's not too big or too small for him.",1
Lots of space but my dog escaped and broke the door the very first day. We even zip tied her in on the door because we felt it wasn't strong enough for our dog. We now have to buy a new crate and will go for the plastic kind.,0

Super cute.,1
"Ive purchased the small, the big, the medium thickness in these branches, and they are really cool! I took the flukers vines and twisted them up with one thick and one thin vine and came out with a very cool jungle vine for my Leachianus geckos. I know these would work great with chameleons and other arboreal geckos, HOWEVER, you may need to tie up part of this branch if you own a heavier reptile, because it cant hold up too much weight. That is why I ended up twisting multiples together to support my heavier geckos. Ive seen/heard people sew a portion into the upper screen of their cage to support the weight, which I haven't tried yet (lazy) but can see that working well.",1
"I bought this item after reading up on Sulcata tortoise care and mixed it with organic topsoil to create an area for my two hatchling Sulcata tortoises to burrow into.  I found that rather than burrow into it, they prefer to walk around on the soil and use it as a basking area, so decided to plant several miniature cacti in it for them to eat.  It is really easy to work with and I change it every couple of weeks, so it lasts a pretty long time.  It's a great product.",1
"Probably a great product -- but my cat freezes like a statue everytime you put it on him, so it's not much use to me",0

My kittens loved these. Any time I open a can now they follow me around expecting their canned cat food!,1
"My first Amazon review ever is unfortunately because I'm still so angry about this product. I was so happy to have found an easy way to transfer my dog's rabies tags between collars.

The very first time I put the tags on my new large Rubit the whole thing disappeared within a couple hours.  That meant that not only was I out the $5 for this crazy overpriced clip, but I now no longer had rabies tags for my dog that lives in a major city with tight pet ordinances. I had to drive an hour each way to get to the clinic that had administered her vaccinations and pay the rabies fee again since they had to refile the paperwork and assign a new tag number.

The tag eventually resurfaced a few days ago, so I can see that the clip had immediately broken. There is no way she could have put any additional pressure on it and it turned up in the corner of her kennel, so either we got a defective clip or this product is very poorly designed. Either way, I can't trust a replacement with her tags and risk losing them again - even though I now have a spare rabies tag, I rely on both the rabies and her ID tag to ensure her safety and return if she were to get loose from her kennel or when we're out walking..",0
"Ordered for my GSD, this would fit a cat",0
Very sturdy and well built.,1
"I'm using it to confine my dog after TPLO surgery. Roomy, durable, a must have in case of emergencies.",1
It was missing the middle plate that is necessary to join the bottom and top halves. Could not finish assembly. Amazon is shipping me another. I just hope it is not missing parts as well.,0
It only lasted for a few months. I feel like it runs through batteries really quickly,0
"The jacket works great for storms but doesn't seem to chill the dog in stores. The last storm, instead of going nuts and running around, he slept through it. Really wonderful.",1
"Cat doesn't like this toy, so it sits and collects dust",0
I just started using this for my cats.  I think they like it but only if I use 1/4 - 1/2 a squirt in their dinner bowl.  Any more than that is too much for their taste buds.,1
Product is great but didn't realize how overpriced this was. It was 3x more than Walmart and Chewy.com.  First time experience and this was a much higher price!!,0
"Very nice leather collar with studs and spikes.  Looks great on a Boston Terrier! (Using 14"" length for a standard breed/size Boston Terrier)",1
"Doesn't fit to my pan, and my ratties can still get behind the ledges, plus it's aluminum/ton, bends out of shape stupid easy.
Waste of money.",0
My dog really loves this toy. There are squeakers everywhere in this toy. This has become his new favorite and is perfect for a large breed dog. I will be buying the other ones soon.,1
Great product!!,1
Birds love it!!  Keeps them busy.,1
heavy,0
"I love this product, my Border Collie Loves this product.",1
DO NOT ORDER A SMALL TO SMALL,0
This is an excellent training lead! You can't beat the price. I bought this for my chocolate lab and I think the green/white/leather colors look really handsome on him. The leash is great quality. It makes me feel like Cesar Millan from The Dog Whisperer! Definitely recommend.,1
"Perfectly designed for its purpose. Introduce your dogs gently and they are likely to love it, particularly if the destination is fun. I found it easy to assemble; well-designed and manufactured parts fit exactly.

You're likely to want the cushion: without it the floor is taut and slippery and may contribute to canine anxiety.",1
"This stair has no weight to keep it in place and they are not wide enough for all dogs to trust, even if they are skinny and fit dogs",0
I paid $26.00 at a local pet store called Chowdown.  My dog wore it one time for a brief try out walk.  I know it was put on correctly.  Youtube has a video you can use for this purpose.  Part of the harness was frayed and snapped after one use.  I don't recommend anyone buying this product.  They advertise that they will replace the broken part times 2 but not the leash for $6.99 not including postage.  They won't without a LOT of inhibiting requirements.  They admit that dogs will chew on the harness.  My dog did not.  She was supervised while wearing it and it was removed after the walk to prevent chewing.,0
Got it for my rabbit and he enjoys running through it every now and again. Easy to store. 10/10.,1
Best value for biodegradable dog bags. Great product.,1
Worked the first few times applied then started to notice that I had to apply it every 3 weeks. It never occurred to me that there was a problem with the medication. I just assumed that the fleas were just super bad this year due to the heat. Gradually the fleas started to return before the third week was over & now it's down to less than a week before the fleas return. Maybe the vet's version is stronger & this less expensive version just doesn't work?? I stopped using & decided to look for something else.,0
I received two soccer balls and one had a hole in it and becomes flat when the dog puts it in their mouth! My dog loves these balls but I will not order them again. Too much money,0
It's not so practical. The depth of stairs are not wide for dog to step onto. It is slippery.,0
I purchased a large and it is way too small for a golden retriever.,0
Updated review:  So in the end this lasted from April 7th to April 18th with a 9 month old Border Collie.  I expected longer mileage.,0
Wasn't very effective for my dog.,0
"I was skeptical - it seemed unlikely that something so simple could improve my German Shepherd's rumbly stomach and gas issues.  He's always had a very sensitive system, and we are careful to restrict his diet to kibble and very digestion-neutral treats like rice, chicken and hard biscuits.  However, that wasn't working - he's had horrible gas emissions since we adopted him over six years ago.

Call me convinced.  We're on our second jar of this stuff and Buddy is much improved.  Over the past nine months of using this product his incidence of room-clearing flatulence is greatly reduced - a benefit worth any price.  There have been no negative side effects, and putting a couple scoops of the powder on his kibble each evening is as easy as it gets.",1
Good size for the money. Lots of yummy marrow for my dog. Will buy again.,1
"Dvd was not included. Item itself is as described, but there's no instruction without the dvd. Good thing I saw the infomercial",0
"I played with this 2x with my dog, the second time he ripped the ball straight off the rope while playing tug of war. I don't let him use it as a chew toy, it was strictly being used as a tug of war toy and the ball literally ripped in half after 2 uses. He then proceeded to shred the rope in less than a day. You get what you pay for. Most ropes take him at least a few days if not a week to destroy.",0
"When I received the item, the leach did not light up!  I tried to click the button couple of times but it would only turn on occasion.  Now (after less than a month of use) it is completely dead.

Also, I believe I ordered 6-feet but I am pretty sure the leash is way shorter!",0
"My small dogs seem to enjoy this canned food a lot.  The 4 stars, not five came from the condition of the cans.  Always several cans are dented when received.",1
"Unless you have a 2 pound tiny dog, the sweatshirt has no support.",0
"I purchased this for my foster dog, Charlie who suffers from a long unhealed wound that has turned into a major drive to lick not allowing it to heal.  Received this sleeve and with cone on and kenneled, he was able to tear a large hole in the sleeve portion.  This sleeve is made well and the concept is GREAT...best I have found.  But need something that will hold up without tearing, thinking armor in Charlie's case!
I am actaully still using it with a sock over the sleeve and duct taping together.  So far, so good.",1
Fits great!,1
Our pups love these but I think one of them has an allergic reaction so we need to find a different variety! However the smell really good (to the pups) and they are eager to do their training,1
"My Siamese loves this scratcher, although it is too small for my larger cats, it is a good purchase for my small one.",1
"I've had these lights for my reef aquarium for a little over a year and all of a sudden one started giving off an electrical burning smell.  When I opened up the top of my aquarium, there was smoke coming out of the fixture. Because it had barely been over a year, the warranty time, the company would not replace the lights.  Now I am looking at having to by two more lights for my aquarium.",0
Based on recommendations from other cat owners I purchased this for my outdoor cat....the only time it is cool is when I put it in the refrigerator...that's not how I understood it to work as the pet is supposed to lay on it and feel cool.  Not so....I'd anything it makes her warmer as she was sweating more because of the pad....would not recommend for a cat.,0
My cat would not touch it!,0
"The clip broke after 10 months. My 65 pound dog, that has had back leg issues her entire life, snapped the clip when she saw another dog and the chase was on. I recommend looking for one with a stronger clip on it if I were to do it again.",0
Awesome!,1
"I was really nervous about ordering this.  Most reviews seemed to indicate that he may not like it, but we are really trying to avoid having our cat's front claws removed.

We set it up, put the catnip on, and he watched me actually claw the catnip into place.  Then he went nuts,rubbing himself all over the surface, sniffing, licking and rolling over it. The moment he put his claws out and tried to scratch the surface, HE HATED IT!  Won't touch it now, even with new catnip...just kind of sniffs it and rolls, but WILL NOT SCRATCH!

The only part he liked, which I thought might be a saving grace, was the little feather and bell on a stick.  Unfortunately, you cannot secure that, so he kept removing it and hiding it around the house, so he had no incentive to go back to the board.

I was really worried about wasting 30 bucks on this,and now I have.",0
Fell apart very fast.,0
No mess,1
"I use this for my pot belly pig to get in and out of my car. With persistence and coaxing, he now goes in and out like a champ!",1
"Have had this in our CX-5 for a month now and think it was a good purchase.  It fits well, appears to be very well made and does exactly what it was intended for.  The material is very sturdy and we keep a soft washable blanket on the seat which makes it even more comfortable for our 45# boy  My only criticism, and it's very minor, is that the back portion could be a couple inches wider - as can be seen by the illustration it doesn't quite reach the outside edges of the seat back.  We looked at several of these pet covers before and after purchasing and would choose this one again.",1
"Does not rake well; often times I find large un-raked clumps in the box, and also an un-leveled layer of litter when it does clear the clumps.  I find myself removing clumps manually quite a bit.  May try a light-weight clumping litter to see if it helps.  At this point this was not an ideal purchase for me.",0
"Have been using this for a few years now and my four legged friends who once suffered with itchy skin are cured.  Great product, good price.",1
"A powerful stream of bubbles keeps even live shrimp kicking. A must-have for live bait in a bucket. My old ""Quiet Bubbles"" is finally dying and this seems to be twice as powerful. Took off a star because this is splash-proof, not waterproof. They recommend you use the clamshell case it came in to shed spray, but that seems more trouble than it's worth. Has a clip on the back. Also, REMOVE THE BATTERIES when not in use. I had two pairs of coppertops corrode in my old one and it's just a mess. If you are leaving bait overnight, buy the AC powered version.",1

My cork round that was received is only 9inches tall. Exactly half of what I thought I was buying.,0
Great,1
The chicken flavored medi-wraps were exactly what I wanted/needed for my dog. They are moist and pliable. I can actually break them apart and mold around the pill. My lab loves them and gobbles up his pill every morning. Will buy them again.,1
"Disappointed.  Ordered 2 cases and 90% of the cans were damaged. Would be okay with a small dent, but ALL the cans had major damage. Not sure the seals are all safe and in tack. I believe the cans were all damaged before packaging as they all had the same type of damage. Just disregard in my opinion.",0
Grain free! Healthy dog treats that are not junk yet tasty for our dog. Just remember that healthy pet treats without all that grain fill are less per bag but less is good in these cases. We buy all our pet treats from Amazon but have now shifted to grain free treats and they are affordable. Make the conversion to healthy pet food and make your pets healthier like we are doing.,1
It doesn't work,0
"My cats love the regular version of this flavor. One of them got crystals when we switched their dry food, so she had to be put on special food for that.

We also tried to give them this, but none of the cats were very fond of it. Two of the cats would still start eating it, but none could bring themselves to finishing it, and they'll eat just about anything/ not picky at all.

So, it's a nice idea, smells and looks the same to me, but don't expect your cats to eat much of it, or at all.",0
"We have a large GSD mix along with a senior beagle that would move the previous gate we had which did not attached to the wall.  We tried all kinds of gates pressure mounted gates, freestanding gates, and the large dog would bust through them or the beagle would move them and they all did not allow you not to have to step over something at the bottom or have the same amount of space as if nothing was there.  I was getting ready to have a local company fabricate me a wrought iron gate but the price was more than I was willing to pay but I had searched the internet high and low and found nothing like what I wanted at a reasonable price until this gate, which is perfect!
I love it because it was easy to install, opens either way in or out, and opens all the way against the wall so you have the same amount of space to walk through if needed as if the gate was not there.  If for some reason, you need to move the entire gate temporarily that is simple to do, just remove the ring and the bottom the pull the rod out, viola the gate is completely out of the way, and it is easy to put back when you are done.
It is secure at the wall although longer screws are recommended for both sides if you are screwing it into studs if not get the proper, hardware needed for you wall application; it only comes with two long screws.
I did install it higher than recommended because the GSD is tall but I kept it low enough the beagle cannot get under it.",1
"This product is made well, but does not function well at all in my car. Both top corners do not stay up and fold over, my dog doesn't like the feeling of the fabric (she is an 11 year old Husky/Malamute, but I have had a couple other dogs in the car and they don't seem to like it either. Also, if the buckles come out of the velcro holds, the whole thing slides forward and needs to be reset. For the price, I would of expected something a lot better in design and functionality. Giving it 2 stars because it is sewn strong and looks good when the corners done fold in or it falls off the seat. Spend your money else where in my opinion.",0
These diapers have a better fit for my female pekingese. They have more flexibility in the legs and waist making for a more comfortable fit.,1
"Tiny, neither one of my dogs liked them.",0
"floats a little uneven, but like the top handle",1
The filters keep the water fresher longer,1
These chews keep them busy and out of trouble,1
We got two kittens and These things are awesome we have a 3 yr old son and a leather sofa and we worry about scratches. These were quick apply and the kittens didn't seem to mind. They look like glossy painted nails lol. I don't know how long they will last but the glue seems super strong so I'm confident they will stay on good. I highly suggest these!,1
"I'm a professional dog groomer and I LOVE these clippers! I definitely feel like I get a smoother cut and I don't have to go over the coat as many times. I wish I had these years ago. Very heavy-duty. I can't recommend these enough!

For people who are not professional groomers, I often see comments like ""heats up quickly"" in reviews. Most groomers I know have two or three of the same blade to switch out when the blade gets hot. There's also cooling stones and cool lube you can use. The higher the RPM of the clippers, the smoother cut you will get. However, blades will also get hotter more quickly due to the friction. (Don't forget to get blade disinfectant, too!) Also, most people I've talked to seem to either be diehard Oster or Andis fans, so if you don't like Andis clippers, maybe give Oster a try. I like Andis better because Oster clippers and blades seem to be louder and vibrate more. The one pair of Oster clippers I used broke pretty quickly too. The part that broke was made of plastic (inside the clippers); this same part is made of metal in the Andis clipper I have owned.",1
My puppy loves her new bed. It's durable & comfortable. I LOVE that you can tgrow the whole thing in the washing machine. Thank you!,1
"Mine did not come with probes.  I have posted the question regarding these and have received no answer.  I don't know if it's because of the lack of probes, but this only goes off when my dog plays and when he barks very loudly.  He's a labrador, so that's a loud bark to cause it to trigger...",0
Great product but this is a ridiculous price. 5 Stars for the product though,0
"It worked the first winter but plugging it back in a couple of days a go...deader than a doornail. It's (let's just say...) ""upsetting"" that it died so easily. I'm researching the heater market before I purchase a new one, but this may be one of the best ones and we just have to deal with their planned obsolescence. How is it things are so much easier to make now, but they break faster?",0
"I've lived with cats most of my life, and like every cat lover I've been in search of the perfect litter box. This is NOT it. My oldest cat wouldn't use it, and I assume he simply didn't like the crystals. No problem; I hadn't thrown our old litter box out, so that became his exclusively. That left one (1) tiny, four-pound using the ScoopFree. According to the ""health counter"" on our unit, the little guy needed his box 5 to 6 times a day. From personal observation, that was about two poops and three to four tinkles -- well within normal limits.

Even so, the odor was horrible, even after the rake scooped the hard matter into the cartridge. No, it no longer smelled like poop, or even urine, but it still had a foul, unpleasant, at times even nauseating odor.

We tried everything: emptying the cartridge daily, raking the litter in from the sides, even removing older litter and adding a bit more fresh litter daily. I wound up putting an activated charcoal filter AND an air-freshener in the small (4x6') room where we keep the ScoopFree. Nothing worked. It stunk!

Now, if I'm spending that kind of money on a ""revolutionary"" litter box AND more money on expensive litter and special trays, I expect it to work as advertised. In one month, though, I had to change the tray every 5 days just to keep the stench from spreading elsewhere in my house. That's so contrary to the product claims that I just can't recommend this box, and am contacting the company to ask for a refund.

(If anyone's curious, we're going back to using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Self-Cleaning-Litter-Box-Large-Green-and-Beige/dp/B0002DK2DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Large, Green and Beige</a>&nbsp;box that I'm so glad we'd never thrown out. We're on our fourth year with it, and it's still the best box we've ever used!)",0

The product excelled my expectations! My dog is very skeptic when it comes to getting brushed. Since he is a black thick coated lab hes got some hair on his big body. It got off that trapped hair and dirt underneath and left his coat nice and shiny. SleekEZ is an outstanding product !,1
What can you say it's made by Kong,1
This broke apart as soon as I used it.,0
Great! Same foodiet my cats love and delivered on time!,1
One coming broken you need to improve the way you pack this product,0
Good product soft and durable,1
This was way too small to hold. The picture doesn't match the actual size.,0
"This brush is the perfect size for my small dog's mouth.  The one I had before this was a double headed one I got from my Vet's office, one side larger and one smaller.  The smaller side on that one was fine but this one is a tad smaller and why have a brush with a large brush head, too, when I have a small dog.  The brush is soft and not abrasive.  I will purchase more of these to have on hand as I guess, like for people, you should replace a toothbrush about every three months.",1
"Poor quality, had defects and was to small.",0
I was suspicious at first because it looked like it would fall apart but it holds well and the cats love it,1
"I bought this for my dog, and upon playing with it with only a few throws the side cracked and became dangerous, I returned this product.  It does light up as advertised.",0
Nice smaller size. I've owned a few of these over the years and keep coming back when it's time to replace.,1

"I wanted to like this harness because other harnesses make my girl so hot in the summer, but the design is flawed :( the neck strap is too small and the girth strap is not secure enough to hold the top in place so the harness will constantly fall to one side. My dog has trachea issues as well, like most small dogs, and this harness puts all pressure on the neck when she is moving forward, causing her to cough and become distracted when she is supposed to be focused/working. I'll give 2 stars for the cute color combos but otherwise I wouldn't recommend.",0
I got the line run and hooked up fine but the collars don't work. No green or red light,0
I'm sold on this when I see the difference in my dogs health.,1
Poorly made.,0
The perfect harness.  I have two Texas Blue Lacys.  Needed a halter for the tandum tie out we use in the back of our pickup and our Artic Cat 4x4.  They fit great.  Dogs don't seem to notice them at all.  Be sure to measure....they both took a size larger than I would have expected.  Well made.  Like the bright colors for the woods.,1
"DO NOT purchase this item as an outdoor shelter. IT IS NOT...Wind, rain, snow, whatever will blow this away.

Of course, it needs daily assistance to clean the track and make sure the potty hasn't accumulated all on one side of the receptacle BUT beats twice daily scooping hands down!  I put old grocery bags over the poo container and the way i put them on all i have to do is pull on the handles of the bag and never risk touching anything and it's cheaper than replacing the plastic container all the time!

"I have 2 huge dogs.. each over 100 pounds.  trying to find things for them to play with is apian.  they just tear things up within a hour,  even KONG toys.
this has been on my wish list for a while..  I wasn't sure my pups would like it.
Man was I wrong! they love it!  and I have had to for 4 days, and they have not tore it up.  they are strangely genital with this.  Its odd.  its the funniest thing, watch my big 130# dog running around with this tiny little toy in his teeth.  he does rip it up like normal,  he just pronounces around with it.  my other dog does the same,  but likes getting the amainals outta the toy!

Could never get it to work!,0
Great waste bags! wish they were cheaper.,1
"I read the reviews from the people who said the lid was tight fitting so I bought it. The lid fits tightly but it is NOT AIRTIGHT. The lid has a closure snap on it so the lid won't come off, but Keep in mind that this does not protect food from air and moisture or little bugs that can get inside. I discovered moth worms in this bin of pet food just this morning. You can press on the lid and release and feel and hear air rush in and out of the container. While it's a lovely container, it's not food quality or pet food quality. I will have to throw away the pet food and since it's special diet food, it will cost me more to throw away the remaining food than it did to purchase this container to protect it.",0

"Perfect water bowl for road trips.  I fill the bowl about half way and it does not splash out when on road trips.  It sits flat and does not tip even when driving on rough roads.  Made of a decent plastic.  Exactly what I was looking for for a dog bowl on the road.  Because of the lip some others gave feedback about drying it after washing.  I just shake out the water and dab up the tiny bit of water left with a paper towel.  Other feedback people said that it wasn't very big.  Not a problem, this bowl is exactly as advertised, a 10 inch bowl.  If your dog needs more water periodically then add water if needed.  More people commented that their dogs still make a mess when drinking out of the bowl.  Well it is a great designed bowl for keeping the water from splashing and spilling when a vehicle is in motion, it will not morph a sloppy, messy dog into a tidy, well behaved one.",1

"I was concerned when I ordered this based on some of the reviews criticizing the sizing chart. I purchased a large based on the sizing chart since my dog's neck and chest measured 14"" and 23"".  My dog is not a big dog so I was concerned that the Large would not fit him properly.  After putting it on him, I was very pleased that it fit him perfectly.  The harness is very light- weight and breathable sopft fabric with an adjustable belt that goes around the chest.  The only negatives I have is the stiff plastic clip.  Although it clips in very securely because of it's rigidity, it's a bit difficult to remove.  That may be an issue that may resolve itself with time and constant usage.  A little more padding around the belt that runs behind his legs and underneath him would be nice.  However, I don't think that's really an issue since it doesn't seem to bother my dog and I don't see any irritation on his chest.  He's very active and the harness doesn't seem to slow him down.  Overall, very pleased with this harness.",1

Great cage! Just a described. Love the curved top. Easy to clean as well.,1
"This was my 3rd Litter Maid.  The first two lasted a little over a year each.  It was worth it to me not having to clean a litter box everyday.  This one did not work out of the box.  I followed the setup directions and plugged it in.  The rake just started going back and forth non-stop.  After a little investigation, I found a limit switch that tells the electronics that the rake is in the ""home"" position.  If I pressed my finger on this switch very hard, the rake would finally stop.  DO NOT buy this model from this seller.  It's junk!",0
Easy to put together. Held up all winter. Nice shelter for an outdoor cat.,1
"Very low quality. Made with cheap flimsy wood that I'll be lucky if it lasts for 6 months. Don't waste your money and spend a few more dollars for something that will last and not fall over.  Also the packaging was garbage as well, no protection for shipping, came with a damaged piece.",0
"The window is 14"", so I thought it would work. BUT...... that doesn't include the extra bit needed for the suction cup. It's about 16"" with that.",1
"I use fleece bedding with this cage, so i have none of the problems with flying bedding the way a few other reviewers did. This cage is exactly what's it's advertised to be; a giant space for guinea pigs. the standard 8' cage is the vet minimum size for two pigs, and i purchased two just for good measure. This particular package is such a good deal, i'd ordered the $36 plain cage before, and just paid $20 for the top to match with this one/extra insurance against my cats, so just ordering the top later made the price for this combo pack, which also has the $6 ramp cover and some other crazily priced dividing wall. the configurations you can make are nice, the 16 feet i suddenly don't have on my floor isn't actually taking out of my space since i used the L configuration in a window corner. the pigs are crazy-happy, and i have no fear they'll ever feel cramped again. i can't believe i ever kept the two of them in a ""jumbo"" store cage, 1/4 the size of this for 4 times the money. best cage for guinea pigs. not incredibly solid, but a $1 zip-tie pack fixed that in 5 minutes.",1
My 2 kittens won't even touch this stuff it's been 2 days and I'm worried because they're not eating. They loved the whiskas choice cuts packets so I'll be going to the grocery store to buy some today. I was really hoping they would like this brand especially given the reviews on here but maybe they're just spoiled?,0
Very nice. Delivered quickly.,1
"Although my dog LOVES these, I will not buy again. The smell is ungodly.",0
"Great product, I have a Weimeraner and he is very high strung, and tend to be disobeient, this product really helps me to control him.",1
"I've had dogs all my life and have gone through dozens of leashes. I acquired two Mariners 4 years ago and they are by far the best I ever owned. They're tough yet look great and are just the right length.  Get this leash, you won""t be sorry.",1
"Cute chicken, but not tough! My pup had all the stuffing out of it in less than 15 min. Disappointed.",0
"This is big!  When full, the bottle is very heavy and unwieldy.  But there is no screwing the bottle on.  It sits squarely on the bowl.  The mechanism to keep water overflowing is a floating plug.  Once the bowl is full the plug floats up and blocks any more water coming down.  Simple and clever.  The bowl fills to only about two inches of water which is good because cats are sloppy drinkers and you get less spillage from it.

Just don't leave it where it might be kicked.  That is a lot of water and the stopper won't work if it is on its side.",1
It is very sharp; I can't even use it on my dog.,0
"See this review  [...]

Tremendousy overpriced. Poor performance. Poorly designed. Inconsistent range, inconsistent boundary, inaudible beep tone; inconsistent with ""matching"" collar.",0
"Very durable, I buy one every Christmas for my labs, I end up throwing whats left of it away about 7 or 8 months later. They love the squeakers.",1
The crate arrived 4 days late and the box was open and ripped apart. The black tray that goes in the bottom had a huge crack in it.,0
Dog likes the taste but this does not work and had to double the dose for dogs 40lbs so it ends up only being 1/2 months worth.  Your better off buying canned pumpkin which is far less expensive than this!,0
This works to keep cats from bad behavior. But it damaged the fur around my cats neck. All the fur is gone and might not come back,0
The mattress inside has become so twisted and bunched up after washing Im pretty dissatisfied and wish I had washed it before the return.,0
Poor Description only the top one has a seal. the other one do not.,0
excellent product,1
This filter is very nice. It comes with a lid so my frogs can not get inside the filter. Very quiet and compact. I wanted a filter that would fit inside the tank so I could put the tank right up against a wall.,1
This works very well on cats and small dogs. Sometimes when you rub it on them they try to get away. So I have to pick where I want it to go and start there.,1
"I bought this product thinking it would be as reliable as the air fresheners (that I absolutely love). It was a nightmare. I used this product on good faith...like I said I love the air fresheners. However, my carpet was NOT dark at all. My carpets are light...almost a cream or very light eggshell color and I still had massive white spots. I had to re-steam vac the entire carpet to get the spots out. I think Febreze should stick to air fresheners.",0
"What is the dimension L,W,H",1
"Very nice.  Sturdy, easy to assemble.  Would highly recommend to others with small pups.",1
"great price and product but this won't make you stop to clean, actually I need to clean my box almost everyday because I have 2 cats and this get full very fast.
I used to have the automatic litterbox but it was too messy now  this product help keep the cats area looking better and cleaner",1
"I bought two XL crates at the same time.  They came separately.  This one came in a battered box, top plied open partially and other indications that it had been opened before.  When I tried to put it together, it became evident that the crate was compromised.  It was soldered together in places where it shouldn't have been, requiring me to use wire cutters to pull the crate apart to get it open.  I would have sent it back, but had no time before it was needed.  It was apparent that the box was just put back into circulation after being returned from a previous owner.  Not happy.  But, alas, having worked with many crates over the years, I knew how it should open, thus found the problem readily, though it took some time to remedy.  I would like to find a way to get part of my money back, but I doubt that will happen.

Overall, the MidWest crates are just fine for the job at hand.  They provide a safe ""home"" for your dog, using it as a bed, and for you to use for  training purposes.  Hope this helps.",0
My 3 month old puppy loved it....for about 15 minutes.  She pulled the little tags off within a few minutes - definitely not a toy to be left alone with unsupervised!,0
It was a gift for my son who uses a cane. He can attach it to his wheel chair or wrist. He likes it very much it frees up his hand for other things  he uses it for his service dog..,1

It has a tail-click button and a nice array of LEDs. Note that it runs on 3 AAA batteries.

As for why you'd need or want a UV light, here are a few things you can do with it. Note that you should always darken the room first:

 detect urine on carpets and other fabric -- great in hotel rooms!
 speaking of hotel rooms, this light will also show you other undesirable traces of body fluids on bed covers
 useful for leak detection: A/C fluids, antifreeze, neon, and things like that
 useful for money/bill detection, as well as ID detection
 hunters use these lights to track blood trails in the dark (if your deer runs away after you shoot it)
 and yes, you can spot scorpions in the dark with one of these

So one of these lights certainly can come in handy, even if you don't live in scorpion country. For me, it's cool to have mainly for hotel room inspections -- but also for currency checking.

I was provided a free sample in exchange for my honest review.",1
I bought two and both of them were all scratched eye not worth even putting together. And it will not give me the option to return. I do not recommend anyone wasting their money on this poc,0
"Great size for my German Shepherd to grow into. Unfortunately, it did arrive broken in a few places. I was able to fix them on my own. I was lucky to break was in a good place, and didn't totally destroy the whole thing.",0
"My dog, Charlie, instantly fell in love with this toy!! Not only that, but he enjoyed playing with it for over an hour--he usually loses interest within five minutes). It's so much fun to watch him play with. The only problem is that Charlie was able to destroy the squeakers in the stuffed squirrels pretty quickly. Even with the squirrels no longer squeaking, he still enjoys playing with this! The replacement squirrels are more expensive than the toy itself, so I've ordered extras of this item instead. This is truly a great toy!",1
This is a great tool for giving you cat a little food and exercise when you are away from home.,1
Bought this for our puppy and it stretched out tremendously around the neck. It was so stretched out that it was difficult to use for walking our puppy and we needed to replace it after a month so it was money lost.,0
"If our new puppy could write this review, she would say ""This is my go-to treat for showing my family I can use the potty outside!""  We used this Beggin' Littles as a treat for training our new puppy and they have worked just fine.  She associates good behavior with them and since they are a smaller size than the normal Beggin' Strips, they are very appropriate for treating.  I have never bought a bag that was stale or that the dog didn't absolutely love!",1
"Was excited for my pup to try this, but it almost seems like the food has gone bad. The smell is very odd and my dog won't touch it and he eats everything. Bummed I bought the biggest bag!",0
Not high back style like picture shows. In fact the item is very different from style shown. I am not impressed at all. Like another customer said I could get the same thing for less money at a dollar store. Item needs a much better description as I would not recommend this item.,0
my dog didn't like how HARD they were,0
Fast shipping and great customer service! Works as expected and removes a ton of hair.,1
I have a pit/lab mix that chews through every toy I get for him in minutes. Even the heavy duty toys don't last more than a day or two. But this ball has made it several weeks and only has small tooth marks in it. He loves this ball. I'm pretty impressed. I bought the Kong Extreme bone as well (same material) but he didn't care for it as much.,1
My dog loves this toy & it is pretty durable but i would not recommend for dogs who like to tear it up to get to the squeeker but I think it is great for dogs who just love to tug at it & play catch. I have bought several different ones & they wash well.,1
I have a 40 pound dog and this item aged very quickly. Does not hold up well on the seats. Sides are very flimsy and fold down.,0
Didn't work for my horse.,0
Great product.  Does exactly what I expected it to do.  Nice to see a new and unique product.  Good quality and very sharp scissors.,1
"Not quite the same as the existing collar I was attaching to and if not careful when storing the collar, they can fall off. However, they do work perfectly when the collar is on, which is all that is really needed! I guess my original collar was a different brand, but I have no clue now, years later!",1
It did not work!!!,0

This thing doesn't swing lightly, it swings hard, and the ball is hard.  Major fail!  Why would you make a cat toy that smacks the cat hard in the face?  Now, when I turn it on, she runs away.  She will play with the ball when the toy is off.  Also, after it swings a few times, it gets wrapped up on itself.",0
"Do not buy this brush!  I used it maybe 5X and the bristles sunk into the brush. Completely useless! I knew it wouldn't last me a lifetime when I bought it but, I didn't think it would fall apart in less than a week.",0
Works great. Doesn't take up a bunch of space and love that it's collapsible and easy to clean. My dog doesn't mind being in it either.,1
Not accurate,0
Super cute! Would fit a small to medium dog.,1
"This sliding glass door doggie door does not work or fit properly!! They said it locks into your door and it will keep all ""Varmints"" out but there is no way it could be able to do that because, when we put it in our sliding glass door, it left a huge gap at the bottom because it did not lock in place correctly like they said it does. I would not recommend. I would rather pay a little bit more for the ones at the pet store, which is what i am going to do.",0
Great,1
"The problem is there is no leash hole in the back of the coat for a harness.  Useless to me without one.  For dogs this size I would think they would realize people use a harness rather than a neck collar.  With the hood, you can't see that there is no harness leash opening.  It should say in the description.",0
My son's dog punctured the collar 30 minutes into wearing.  Was able to bite it. Don't buy this. Not worth the money.,0
"I bought this just 3 1/2 weeks ago and the handle broke off. The only thing holding it on was small round crimps, not screws, rivets or even welded. I had to screw it back on just to get by until
I can get another one.  My last scooper lasted me 20 years, wish I had purchased another one like that in the first place.",0
"This is a steal!  I regularly pay $6-7 for ONE bag of orange drops,  and this saves me a few bucks.  My piggy just loves these as a daily dose of vitamins and they smell so good.",1
"The dog toy came dirty and looked used.  For this reason, I gave it 1 star.",0
broke from the connection to the plate in 2 months,0
Good quality brush and works great. Would recommend it.,1
My dalmatian loves this food! Before I was using Kirkland Signature Healthy Weight. I didn't want to stop buying her food from Costco but she only ate that brand because there was nothing else. Now when I feed her she wags her tail.,1
"This product doesn't sit properly on the back of a vehicle, making it precarious and not stable when the dog tries to get on it.  The plastic on the piece itself doesn't grip the paws of the animal.  Our 80 pound dog can't use it and neither can our 10 pound dogs.  They fall off it if they can get on it at all.  It ended up hurting our elderly dog when she fell off and we hurt our backs trying to get them on it.  It's easier just lifting them into the vehicle.",0
Does not work very good,0
Would of been nice if came with bags. BERY SHORT.,0
"I purchased this for a 10 lb Peek-a-Poo, although it was not tall enough for my bed, when dog tries to use it, his weight tips it over and he gets frightened.  It should have been more stable and heavier.",0
"I was shocked at how great the quality is for that price. Totally worth it. I went to Petsmart and their dog tags are over priced. Unfortunately my dog died 2 days before that tag came in. So now it's a keychain on my car keys.
But I'm definitely ordering more for my other dog and cat.",1
easy to use,1
great value,1
"Well, it's like this. MY cat is a very funny guy. Very fancy, no interest at all of new things.
I tried the catnip that perfect came with. Nope no go. I tried spraying catnip perfect. Nope no go, what a old poop. Well anyway my judgment of perfect arch not valid. Because the cat not interested in it.
So don't go on my judgment.
Other words try the arch and pray.",0
"Received it on a Thursday, put it on our puppy -- by the following Monday morning, I yanked it off. Can't rate if it works for teas and ticks, but it repels humans just fine ... my fingers and hands began to blister, itch and then felt like they were on fire. It began gradually over the weekend until I put two-and-two together, and realized I was having a major reaction to the collar. Wasn't going to take the chance that the puppy would be affected to.

The active ingredient in the collar is imidacloprid and flumethrin, one (or both) of which is what I must be reacting to ... the only solution is to avoid my dog ... like that's ever going to happen. Blisters so bad that some are opening up, and I'm having to cover the open sores with band-aids.

Don't buy ... expensive lesson to learn. Our first dog used Advantix, and we'll go back to that again.",0
Perfect for cat grooming!,1
Our puppy was reluctant to wear anything on his feet but once he was running and realized he did not have any stickers or thorns on him he adapted to them quickly.  Now when he sees us taking out his muttluks he gets excited and lays down to let us put them on him.,1
very pleased,1
"This product is very poorly made. It is not sturdy at all, as stated by everyone else, you need to put rocks/sand in it so it doesn't slip when the car is playing with it. Although my cat has no interest in it. The rope is poorly made and is already coming off even though the cat hasn't touched it yet. This is a complete waste of money!",0
I have no clue what the heck I just recieved.. It even has like.. Russian or something on one side of the box.. And it states that it was made in China... Would not recomend.. I'm shipping it back asap..,0
Pup loves it so much I had to buy 2,1
"The only reason I am giving this product a bad rating is because my dog developed diarrhea from it. My Rotti has a stomach made of iron, she has eaten metal dog collars, fabric scraps, a baby bunny whole,  bed sheets and none of those upset her stomach like these did. I am sure this is a great product just not for my dog. I will need to go back to Dasoquin. :(.",0
"sturdy, cat really loves it",1
these are great and very durable/ lasted a long time with my lab.  Great for teething.,1

"I have just started to train my dogs with this clicker. To begin with I am getting them to associate the click followed by a treat when I get wanted behaviors. They are loving it and so am I. The clicker seems to be of good quality and loud enough, but not too loud in my opinion. I like the red color too because it helps stand out and not get easily lost. Great deal.",1
"Makes a gurgling noise while dog drinks out of it as its refilling. Dog is scared of it, won't drink water. Also, the ""lid"" on top doesn't do anything really, it's not open on top. Must be filled from bottom.",0
"This was a real waste of money, nothing done wrong by shippers or people who I bought it from just a bad product to have in a bird cage for a nest. They have to sit on the floor and of course you know what happens when the birds fly around over it. Gets full of crap. So not a good product for a bird nest at least not in my cage.",0
"My dogs will eat anything you give them. One of them started to vomit and had loose stools. I tried to give it to my dog but he refused to even taste it. I tried to give this again, he would not even smell it when he saw it.  I thought it was only my first dog. I tried to give this to my other dog who would is a bigger eater just to see if he would try it.... No luck. This is just a waste of money. I gave my doggy a mixture of water and sugar and Gatorade.... He perked right up and is eating well again.",0
"This fit our mixed breed doggy perfectly except the first attempt at him trying to paw it off, it ripped. Oh well, you get what you pay for, it was affordable and even with the rip it still stays on.",0
"Settled her down for a while, but it didn't last.",0
"I bought this for my very large American Bulldog because he loves anything with a squeaker in it. He immediately took out all the squeakers and played with all of them. I never thought in a million years this could be harmful. The next morning, I woke up to hearing him throw up. I went and checked on him and sure enough, he had thrown up an ENTIRE egg. I had no idea that he could even swallow something that large! Luckily he threw it up and didn't choke on it. I immediately had to throw the toy away. I have definitely learned my lesson with giving him small chew toys. I just wanted to warn anyone with larger dogs to make sure they watch their dog the entire time they are playing with this toy and if you are not able to then you probably should not purchase this toy.",0
It's light weight and perfect to take with for a tall horse easy to use.,1
"Good for a large size dog, way too big for a cat. Returned item",0
"After less than 2 years of use, one of the dual diaphragms ripped and if it is not unplugged the pump is very loud.",0
These seem to be well made and will last. A little awkward to clip on to the collar but oh well.,1
"It says aluminum, but the main part that attached to the wall and goes through is flimsy plastic.",0
I Bought this for my moms cat can not put it together cause all the holes are not lined up will not buy again,0
I think this food while healthy is too rich for our puppy's stomach. He's been eating it one month and still has diarrhea and loose stool.,0
"I have bought this from the store before but for some reason, my cat did not like this tube. He would not eat any of it. Not sure if it might have been rancid.",0
"Just pulled these out of the mail about 2 hours ago.  After 2 hrs of playing fetch and my cat playing w/ one of these on his own, the mouse is already unraveling at the tail end and one of the ears has fallen off.  Maybe my 1yr old cat possesses super-cat strength or maybe this really isn't that durable of a product.  No cat toy shouldn't be that easily destroyed and I'm disappointed after seeing so many people rate this so well, which is exactly why I picked this one.  I have put that ""dead mouse"" in my drawer and have given a new mouse to Cairo.  I will update this review w/ the results of Cairo's next play time.",0
"No cats will eat this, and this includes several stray cats out back.  When even a stray cat will turn up its tail to this product, there must be something wrong with it.",0
"My dogs love these snacks, plus I don't need to worry about a lot of fillers and unhealthy ingredients. You can also break the snacks in half to make the bag last longer.",1
We have a 12 year old cat and she really likes this food and it seems to agree with her better than some of the store brands,1
"I love this product! I mix it in my chickens water and they love it. I mix this with apple cider vinegar and water and have never had a health issue with my flock yet :)! We only have 10 chickens so 1 pack lasts a while, but we will probably always buy this stuff for them. Plus I think they drink more water now so I know they are staying hydrated. It's an easy way go give your chickens some extra vitamins they might otherwise be missing out on. Plus its like 5 bucks!!! Great deal! Just mix a small amount into the water, it dissolves like cool-aid and bam! Happy chickens!!",1
"I washed it once and all the stuffing came out. I have a front loader washing machine, therefore not an issue with the machine.",0
My dog loves this - but can purchase a package that is a 24 count for $8.00 vs the $14.54 for a package of 15 chews.,1
"This smells amazing! Finally, we can get our dog to smell wonderful without having to take her to Petco (reminds us of their pumpkin spice scent).",1
Rips very easily when the dog wants to scratch himself. It's very cute but the material is more for a dainty dog that doesn't do much activity. Very disappointed...,0
My hedgehog loves it.,1
Came ripped and the wire keeping it open broke through,0
"We got this for our Sheltie for Christmas. It took him less than a minute to get all the treats bits we loaded it with. The pieces spin too easily. When he nosed it they all opened up. I attempted to follow the directions to create more resistance and make it more difficult but when following the directions to tighten the knob underneath, the toy comes apart. Turning the knob in the opposite direction tightened the knob but didn't create more resistance. We are not impressed and don't feel this toy challenges our dog at all.",0
Delivered on time.  All expectations were met.,1
"Has BHA & other harmful chemicals/preservatives  known to cause tumors in lab rats!  Found this out after extensive research after my 4 yr old pup developed a tumor. We threw away these & a handful of other ""treats"". THIS DOG TREAT IS NOT RECOMMENDED!!!",0
Fit my chihuahuas great!!,1
The wrong toys were sent.  We ordered the Squeaker Mat toys and received single column chew toys that sound like a duck.  We've tried these before and they don't last.  We needed the 13 speakers as it takes our Wieners some work to kill all the squeakers.  Not a good trade.,0
"Love it! I got a medium pink for my dachshund mix, but probably could have gotten away with a small. The gems are beautiful and she prances around like a princess! Shipping was on time and the packaging was perfect!! Thank you!!",1
"No suction. Both of my labs removed these, with ease. I tried them on both stainless steel and ceramic bowls. BUST!!",0
The door on the box I received is broken and doesnt fit in the door at all. otherwise i like this product.,0
My cat rolled on it for two minutes and then went to pee on something.,0
"No, just no. I received it today and was excited to start forcing to place with my dog, but this e collars unbelievably inconsistent. My dog would either not receive stimulation or he would yalp and try hiding in a bush. I put it on my arm and it would shock me at a level 8 when having it on 1. It's not consistent enough to be of any use, don't skimp out and just spend the extra money on a Sportdog collar.

It's NOT worth saving a few dollars and losing months of training. My dog is now unbelievably skittish, he won't come out of his kennel and when he does he just cowers around, I am completely disgusted with this product and almost smashed it against the asphalt. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. If you think you might be ok because the ""majority"" of the reviews are positive, don't. They're all most likely automated reviews. DO NOT BUY THIS, I can't stress it enough. I even switched it to vibrate for even LESS stimulation, no response, I switched it over to shock mode, on 0 absolutely ZERO and my dog gave out a cry and started twitching bad. Stay clear away!",0
"Unfortunately this toy was chewed apart within 20 minutes of introducing it to our 9lb bichon-poodle.
He did latch on to it quickly, but the plastic squeaky came out so quick and fear he may have even swallowed bits of it.
Wishing I never would have ordered it!",0
"I have never seen better bedding fluff than this.  It is soft and ideal for rodents, easy for them to manage and they absolutely love it.  It comes in pretty, non-toxic vegetable-based colors and it's made from a processed form of cellulose, the basic component of plant cells.  So it's very safe.

I couldn't imagine giving my two pet mice any other bedding.  It truly does provide them with ""sweet dreams.""",1
"The best cat tree I have ever purchased! This is the third cat tree my husband and I have gotten for our cats and this one is by far the best. It came with all the tools I needed to put it together, but note there are NOT any extra pieces so if you lose a bolt you do not have a replacement. The instructions are in picture-form only, but very easy to follow and all the pieces are labeled. It took me about 35 minutes to put together by myself. The ropes are sissal and the covering for the rest of the tree is a thin, carpet-like material. Both my boys are quite large and fit into the condos just fine. I have not put the stairs on yet, but my cats have no problem climbing to the top of the tree without them. I placed the cat tree in front of a window and my cats are currently having the time of their lives! The large box is a big hit as well.",1
"Well OK, I don't love it, but my girls sure do. They have been fighting over it since I gave it to them. My boy however couldn't care less (he does catch mice and gophers, so he may just find it boring). They have been kicking and chewing at it for quite some time now, and it is holding together well. Plus you can't beat the price! I would buy again :)",1
"My schnauzer had started dripping when asleep or relaxing.  Not puddles or anything, but enough to make the house, rug, etc. smell bad.  After the first couple of days of half-doses to get her accustomed to it, she began having stroke- and seizure-like symptoms.  Shaking, difficulty maintaining balance, falling on her face while going to the bathroom, lethargy...it was sad and I feared the worst.  Fortunately, all of these issues subsided within a day or two of stopping administration of this product. For our purposes, a diaper with a little hole cut in the back works much better.  I will not be purchasing again, and unfortunately the return period has expired.  To the trash with this one.",0
Of course the window closed and I cannot return this piece of s***. Tugging from my 11month old puppy and it's torn to pieces. Do not buy if u have big dogs,0
"Listen, before we get started with the review I'd just like to say that I was pretty hesitant about using this device on my dog.  I'm not totally in favor of this kind of discipline, but holy hell did it work like a charm.  Hard for me to argue with results that good and my dog is as chipper as ever.  If you are having reservations about this device because of moral reasons, trust me, I get it.  I'm here to say that you can use the device and train your dog, then take the device off once they get it.  Simple, easy, and no fuss.

Anyway, my story is that my German Shepperd named Bard would flip out all the time when people would walk by my house.  If a dog was being walked outside it was as if a group of terminators were walking by.  Otherwise Bard was a very happy dog with a great disposition.  I tried to train him to stop barking but he would still have the instinct to bark at stuff like this, and I'd have to calm him down or listen to him freaking out all the time.

I put the no bark control on Bard and he got the message that he should stop barking after about a day.  The way it works is that once your dog starts barking it will give a warning beep and if the dog continues barking it will then administer a very small shock.  This implants negative reenforcement to your dog to the action of barking.

Anyways, this device works and works well.  If you're having trouble with your dog barking you should really give this a try.",1
Carbon ran out of filters and into well - cat stopped using fountain because of this.,0

Fast delivery and no complaints.,1
"Well our Dog does too!  We have bought 3 bottles now and our Dog is not quite 2 for about 4 months. The Spa line by Tropiclean is the best out there for dogs. All of the fragrances smell good, has a soft but very clean smell, and last for hours. We use the shampoo and spray combo together to lengthen the time between baths. Our Dog smells fresh and clean .  We are happy and our Dog is happy. Thanks Tropiclean.",1
Unfortunately my cat only plays with this infrequently.,0
good,1
"Cool looking collar, but the reflective line starts fading away over time and looks worn out after a couple months of use, not worth it if you need the reflective feature to last longer than that.",0
"Both dogs seem to like the food, however it gets to be a little pricey for the over 80 pound dog!",1
"Didn't work at all for combing loose hairs of our lab puppy. And what's worse, this line in the description ""Soft Mouth feel for satisfying chew, even with its ultra durability"" seemed to indicate that it's got the same durability as one of the Kong toys so I didn't fret too much when the puppy got hold of it, but next thing I knew, there were little pointed pink nubs in her crate and a few of them presumably in her belly. Not puppy safe at all.",0
My puppy was used to using the pads and when I put the pad on top of the holder she woudn't go near it.,0

"I previously reviewed the Tagg pet  tracker, which I loved and used for years to keep track of a wandering cat who can't stay out after dark.  But ever since Whistle bought Tagg, things have gone downhill.  The customer service people are very nice but the Whistle tracker is simply not reliable and all the lovely customer service in the world won't find your missing cat if the tracker isn't working.  I finally cancelled my Whistle service after I had so much trouble finding the tracker that it became more stressful than trying to find the cat.  Of course the cat has to wear a breakaway collar to prevent him from getting hung up somewhere and choking, and I am thankful that the cat came home, but no matter how I searched, I never could find the tracker and after that happened three times, I gave up.  The whole point of the tracker is to be able to locate it and I'm sorry to say that Whistle's trackers simply don't work.",0
Arrived damaged. The front plastic piece was off and when we finally got it to stay in place the light did not work anyway. Do not recommend.,0
"It's  with me less than 2 months now.
The light is not working anymore.
The filter was burned.
Please do not buy this low quality kit.",0
"These are perfect for any sort of consumable bird supplies. I like the large sizes even for small birds (I keep a large parrot, medium-sized orioles, large finches, and small tanagers) because it gives them room to dig through and find what they want, with less of the throwing of perfectly good seed and fruit etc. that are not what they want at that moment. It also gives plenty of room for bathing when used for water.
I bought several more than I need because I like being able to rotate them though the dishwasher between use.",1
"I loved this. I bought this for a camping trip that my fiance' and I went on to the Linville area. One of our outings was to Grandfather Mountain to hike up to McRae's Peak. This is a good trail with lots of ladders and boulders to climb over. My little dog General Patton LOVES to go hiking but this trail was going to have obstacles that a little 10lb dog just wouldn't have been able to over come. Thats where this nifty contraption came into play. It was very durable and easy to figure out. My little guy was perfectly content....as content as a dog that just wants to run can be, but I will say when he was tired of walking he couldn't wait to get in. Not only was it comfortable for my little guy but it was comfortable for me as well. I hiked up to the peak and back down with him strapped to my chest for most of it, climbing up ladders, repelling down steep cliffs and it gave me no discomfort at all and I felt so comfortable with my dog's safety. I absolutely don't know what we would have done without this thing. double thumbs up!",1
Love the scent.,1
My 7 month old Great Dane LOVED his bunny- until the tail came off...and the ears....and the foot ALL ON THE FIRST DAY. He is not rough with his plush toys. We have taught him not to destroy his toys and he has plush toys that have lasted him months. This was a waste.,0
dog scared when I tried to use it.,0
Greenies seem healthier than other treats. I'm hoping it helps with my dogs teeth. My dog loves them and she gets one every day.,1
"It is not me that likes this product... It is my dogs that like it, I can't tell you how many different brands and type of dog food I tried before I tried Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream Canine Formula with Smoked Salmon but the from the very first bowl they love it..!
Would recommend this product to anyone that has a dog that is a picky eater.",1
I had never tried this product before but I was desperate because one of my cats had lost a lot of weight recently due to stress from moving.  Once I started feeding her this product she comes running to eat it and she is putting some weight back on.  I signed up to have it delivered to my door every month through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.,1
"I bought this dispenser on 1/14/18 and then again on 3/30 due to breakage.  They are not durable whatsoever. One fall to the ground and the top part broke in the same place on each of them.  Though they look nice, I'm not impressed with the quality.",0
"We recently found a stray and have been keeping her on our porch and away from our other cat until she A) was vaccinated and B) would use the litter box. We usually use Feline Pine, but she wouldn't go near the stuff. The vet suggested this as an all-natural alternative which might feel better (and more like what a cat would use outdoors) under her feet.

It seems to: she used the box. Hooray! The litter clumped nicely and didn't make a big mess. And the box is really light when filled, lighter than clay, certainly, or even the pine pellets.

The smell, however, is overpowering. They gave her a bath at the vet's office, and at first, I attributed the smell on the porch to that. But no. It's definitely, definitely the litter. Wow! I can't imagine how strong it would smell in our little bathroom where I keep the other cat's box.

If you aren't affected or bothered by strong smells, this would be a good choice. I like that it's corn-based. But like other reviewers, I wish the bag had said ""scented."" I wouldn't have bought it. Because it said it was ""natural"" (how silly of me to believe it!) and and because it came from corn, I didn't expect the smell at all. It's cloying.

Make this unscented, and you'd have a winner.",0
"I'm very happy with this little heater I purchased. It's been a wonderful addition to my 2.7 gallon glass fish tank. The temperature fluctuates a bit, but it's gradual and it stays within the recommended temperature scale. I do like the quality and I'd recommend purchasing one through this company.",1
"I will keep this on hand at ALL times! This stuff is almost magical. My two Goldens are rambunctious, somewhat mischievous, and one of them gets a scrape or small wound about every month or so. The latest (messy!) wound was a torn dew claw on Miss Ellie. Vet stitched it and sent her home on antibiotics and the cone of shame for a week. But after a week, it still looked a little raw and I just didn't trust it yet. I tried some spray stuff a guy in the pet store recommended, and after a couple more days, I didn't notice any difference.  I slathered this stuff on and put her back in the cone for another three days, just so she wouldnt lick it all off. After the three days, youd never know she had a wound at all.  I even used it on myself last week after a wasp sting - one Benadryl, a smear of this, and an hour later, the welt had disappeared. It didn't feel like anything going on - no sting, no itching, nothing. I don't care if its $30 or $50, this stuff is worth it!",1
Really too slick for floor.  Doggie passed so we r sad to see these.,0
Very disappointed with the amount I received.  I didn't realize when ordering it that it was a trial size.  I had ordered a plant and this bag of bedding for my sons snake.  As you can see the plant is twice the size as the package of bedding.  The plant was a heck of a lot cheaper too.  I won't be purchasing this again.,0
"I switched my shih tzu slowly from Purina Pro Plan to this, because she began to dislike that and Royal Canin products have seemed high quality in the past, and this has excellent reviews.

She prefers this even less than the Pro Plan, and will barely touch it until the end of the day, or unless I add chicken broth.  I took 1 star for that.

The ziplock seal for this bag is not very good and constantly opens up, so the food becomes stale more quickly and the odor escapes.  I took 2 stars for that.

If your dog likes it, then go for it. But the packaging does need to be improved.",0
my puppy chewed pieces off. Had to throw out.,0
"Lightweight, easy to use, well made.  Wish I had purchased this months ago!",1
"It's absolutely adorable, and full of clever puns and awesome graphics. However, as an actual scratching toy, it kind of fails.
1. the tabs that hold it together aren't terribly strong, so if you have a cat who likes to jump on things, it will easily collapse. This doesn't impair functionality too much, but it does make it take up more space on the floor, and it doesn't look as good.
2. The scratch plate spins, like a real turntable. While this makes for a cute video, the cats quickly lost interest because it doesn't give them a satisfying scratching experience. They prefer things like couches and carpets, where they can dig in their claws and have the scratching surface remain stationary.
3. The ""arm"" is purely decoration-- it kind of gets in the way and ends up flopping over or coming off.
all in all, it's a clever idea, but poorly executed.",0

"Came with all the parts and was easy to assemble.  The interior is smaller than a large litter pan, so bought a small pan at the local grocery store.  The pan is for dishes, but works for the kitty litter.  We have a medium sized cat and she used the washroom with no hesitations.  Keeps the litter from spilling onto the floor.  The exterior is nice, but I wouldn't use it as a nightstand...it is in the laundry room.",1
Bought a new pup and no matter which collar receiver I used he would still cross the fence line.  But not with this one.  I tried it first on the forth setting and bingo he hasn't crossed yet.  Best thing about this collar is that it uses a common 9 volt battery that you can get anywhere and is relatively cheap compared to other collar batteries.,1
"Bought this product AND Greenies for my dog. My dog is usually doesnt complain and loves her treats. I gave her greenies and she  was so happy.

Our dog had the squeakers ripped out within the first 5 minutes.,0
At first I was so excited based off other reviews. I bought this for my heeler to try and teach him when it's okay to bark and when it's not because we have upstairs neighbors.

Also, I'm not sure why the handle needs to be so small.  But it was less than $2, so who cares, right?",0

"DO NOT buy from Amazon. Made my dog sick! Diarrhea and general malaise. She was not eating much and not drinking when eating this from Amazon. Bought this flavor to give my dog a change from the bison formula. Read reviews for this formula on other sites and people said it had strong fishy smell. This one from Amazon didn't have a strong smell at all and I noticed the size of the kibble was different and darker then the other kind. Dog wasn't a fan and just wouldnt eat it. We thought she just didn't need as much food as she was calming down from living in a kennel before we got her. She was having diarrhea and we switched her to boiled chicken and rice, was doing better, switched her back, and couldn't hold her stools.
Bought this again but at a retail store, 100% improvement.  MUCH happier. Kibble size is the same as the other kind we bought from the store. And the new bag STUNK like fish like it should have. Brooke (my puppy) started freaking out once we opened the bag because she could smell the difference. Ate it up right away and begged for more. Great brand and product if you buy it from the store and not here. Could possibly be fake from Amazon. It defiantly was NOT the same kibble in the bags.  We are not the only people to have this problem.",0
"Wellness is a PetCo brand and is of good quality.  My 70-pound female Golden Retriever had a hot-spots which the vet said could be coming from food allergies, recommending we switch to no chicken, no wheat, no corn in her food.  She eats this dog food with gusto, but then she eats everything with gusto, so it's probably me who likes the brand more than she does.  The ingredient list starts with lamb and ends with vitamins. I believe it is very good for her skin and recommend the product to friends.  Also available on Amazon subscription, which makes this Prime shopper very happy.",1
"Not happy with quality of leash. Substandard, I'm afraid to use it.",0
"She still eats poop. What seemed to work, is, whenever she does, I wipe down her mouth, tongue, palate, teeth, gums with wet butt wipes. It won't work right away, until she gets the message that you do that to her everytime she eats poop. My dog hadn't eaten poop for a while however, the other night, I saw she did again, and so I had to do the wet wipes on her again.",0
I wish it was a little smaller. Though my Yorkie hates her teeth being brushed period. I have found it is better to use a microfiber cloth on her teeth. I just wrap it around my finger and rub it on her teeth. The toothbrushes started making her have basically panic attacks. She would freak out scream and pant like crazy. Wasn't worth putting her through the stress or me. The cloth works really well and causes soooo much less stress for both of us. Though i still can not get her way back teeth. So eventually i will need to take her into the vet for the extreme cleaning. But only once it is truly necessary.,0

You have to push a button (which is only on 1 side), pull up the handle, then pull up and hold the middle of the gate door and swing open.  I can only assume the pulling up part is a sort of secondary safety to keep the gate closed even though the handle is not engaged.  Guests and babysitter have a HECK of a time figuring out how to open the gate.

The IFetch was a wonderful product. I wish I would have been able to get my dogs to use the IFetch but I could not train them properly therefore the IFetch was not for me.

"I'm giving it 4 stars only because my Bengal kitten ADORES this toy. It is the only toy that keeps his attention for hours on end, day after day. He is worn out after playing with it for a while because when it retracts he leaps into the air to get it (warning, do not stand near it once it's up. our cat often stretches it several feet past the door frame then lets go. Flying toy mouse bungee hurling at you does not feel good). Construction wise, it's a piece of garbage  though- hence why we have to buy 3 at a time. The little black stoppers fall off as soon as you open the package- not a big deal because they do nothing to hold the toy in place on your door frame anyway. Cannot tighten the part that goes on your door frame at all. So a very excited determined cat, like a Bengal, will rip this down from wherever you mount it repeatedly. The mouse itself it pretty flimsy. After about a week my cat has literally ripped the mouse body to shreds and turned the ""fur"" inside out. That's when we toss it and open a new one. But, we keep buying because he loves it so. And when we hide it he goes looking for it in the hiding place.",1
"I paid $2.99 which is what they are worth. They don't last very long with my two large dogs,  so I can't see paying more for 3 cheaply made tennis balls. Unfortunately for me, my dogs absolutely love them. I have tried the Kong ones and those are a little more durable. Not much... but a little.
 The squeak always stops working within 1-5 days with these. Sometime the same day and only within an hour or so. These are meant for your dog to bite down on them to make the sound, but these aren't made well enough to withstand a larger dog.",0
"My 2 cats have been eating this exact same canned food for ~ 2 years. I bought 5 cases this order, tried 4 different cans. every time they immediately throw up. Its either contaminated, spoiled, or poisoned. They NEVER throw up. Amazon policy- not eligible for return. It was super expensive!",0
So helpful for our dear old furry friend!,1
"The shampoo is a great cleaner and you need to use very little to get the job done.  The lid, "" bone"" , is a god send for those of us who have arthritis, the bone stays on the lid and makes it easy to use.",1
Perfect size for small dogs or puppies. I have a new dachshund puppy who is into everything so we needed a safe place for her to sleep at night. This is ample size for a puppy or small dog. I love that it has a divider so you can limit the space when your dog is young and then allow for more room as it grows. The whole crate collapses down flat and has a handle that you can attach. I would definitely recommend buying this with the  MidWest Quiet Time Pet Bed and match it to the corresponding crate size. It fits the crate like a glove and is very plush and comfortable for your dog.,1
First time I ever used this product. It works for the fleas but I notice that all my cat still ha itching on all their heas! Cannot explain it. Did work well otherwise. Easy to administer because they are small.,0
The bags are hard to open,0
"Our dog, like most dogs REALLY LOVE these types of bones.  Unfortunately we've stopped buying these types of bones for two reasons.  The first is my son's dogs had to have a lot of dental work done on their dogs as a result of letting them chew on these types of bones.  They are powerful chewers and they could actually crush the bones which resulted in chipped and cracked teeth.

The second is that the father of our dog suffered some serious medical conditions when a shard of these types of bones became lodged in his stomach or intestines.  He was also a powerful chewer and was able to chew the bones into sharp chucks.

***LET ME BE VERY CLEAR***
They didn't buy the bones from this particular seller but I wanted to share some bad experiences that we know have occurred from these types of smoked bones as a general safety precaution.

If your dog isn't a powerful chewer, you might not have a problem or if you supervise them 100% of the time and take them away from your dog if you notice that they have broken the bones into sharp pieces that could be swallowed.",0
"I bought the blue parka for my 10 lb. chihuahua min pin mix last winter. I love that it has matching hat and scarf even though she probably doesnt like to wear the accessories. :) The coat even has a small hole in the back so she can wear the coat over a harness and still hook her leash onto it.

"I received the device on Friday Feb 6, 2015. Charged it for 5 hrs.  Finally used it the following day.  The battery life held a max life of around 6-7 hrs.  I went out and bought a double pack of Duracell 9 volt batteries on Sunday,  replaced the battery in the remote. On Monday the device quit working AGAIN!  I switched out the battery again, went to test it, and next thing the remote is sizzling in my hands!!!! I don't know if this is rare hardware malfunction,  but the shock collar didn't even last 3 full days.  I am definitely going to try to either return this and get my money back or see if they will swap out the device.

UPDATE:

We sent back for an exchange. They were very quick in getting out a new one to us. As much as I would like to say why a great product it is, it is not. The battery friend in this unit as well. It didn't last more than 1 day. We ended up returning this product and went with a different collar.",0

"I purchased this Vision bird bath to go with my Vision birdcage and cover.  I had hoped that it would be as good quality as the these other products.  I was very disappointed in its design.  I have changed it 5 times so far and have been unsuccessful in doing so without slopping water into the bottom of the cage. It is shallow and when attaching it to the cage it dribbles out the front.  One time it fell apart completely and dumped the whole thing! (Ok, maybe I didn't put it back together correctly, but it held together long enough for me to carry it from the sink to the cage before it fell apart!)  It is attractive to look at, but it is frusterating to use.  I have another water container in the cage that my canary seems to prefer.",0
"FITS MY DOG PERFECTLY , LOOKS GOOD ON HIM.  THANKS",1
My parakeets love this block! They go through it pretty fast and I can see that all 7 birds are chewing on it since it stains their beaks orange. I just wish it were cheaper since my birds need a new one every few weeks. My nursing pair really used it while they had the babies in the nest.,1
It's very pretty and large enough for your dog to have lots of room.  It was simple to assemble and water proof.,1
"A friend of ours told us that Fluff & Tuff toys were indestructible.  Wrong answer.  It took less than 15 minutes for my beagle, Speck, to destroy the squirrel and find the squeaker.  I suppose it would be a good toy for some dogs, but it certainly isn't Speck-proof.",0

"YES!!! Got a new puppy last summer. For the past 10 months I have been battling her skin allergies from grass and dirt. All of her hair falling out and red bumps. My dogs love to go to the dog park so its hard to steer away from places like this. After going to the VET after almost every break out my dog gets, paying for meds and shots and shampoo. I had enough. I am always trying new shampoo hoping for a cure all. So I decided to try this guy out. With many of the ingredients having natural anti-inflammatory properties. Many of my pups symptoms wouldnt even occur. No bumps, no itching, no hair falling out, and more importantly no more smelly dog from the breakout. Long time dog owner and dog trainer, I already recommend to my clients.",1
"It was extremely difficult to insert the clip onto the D-ring of my small dog's collar. I can't even imagine how one would be able to do it at all with a D-ring that is any larger. When I wanted to remove it from the D-ring to use on another collar, I could not get the clip to open wide enough and to stay that way. Trying to remove one tag at a time wasn't any easier,  so I figured I would hold it open with a letter opener, and that sprung the mechanism so it is now useless. The package says, ""Quality Guaranteed"". Really?",0
"My dogs love it...but it only took 7 minutes for my 30 lb pup to rip it apart.

"We gave 4 stars as it took multiple applications to fully remove the cat urine odor in our area rug, however it was definitely worth it as it saved a fairly new $500 rug. There was one additional instance of one of our cats urinating on the rug again, so we worried the chemicals in out that were supposed to act as a deterrent weren't working. However after cleaning the last mess, there have been no more incidents. Yay!",1
"As someone who wake up early every morning to beat traffic and arrive to work on time, I do sometimes forget to feed my pets (uh oh..) but luckily this feeder automatically feed my pets, and plus, it feeds them the perfect amount!

I haven't used this to diet my pets since I think they're the perfect weight, but I do use this with both my dogs and it's a great way to manage how much, and when, they eat. Since one of the dogs is smaller, he does require less food and thankfully this machine lets me determine how much is a good amount.

I like how this lets you feed prescription food to certain pets, but since I don't have that problem, I take advantage of it by using puppy food for one dog, and regular dog food for the other! This machine prevents dogs from eating cat food, but I use it to keep the dogs from eating each others foods!

I would repurchase but because I see this machine lasting a very long time, I'll simply recommend it to all my friends :-)",1
We've used this for years for our young lab and elderly miniature pinscher. Both show dramatic improvement in agility & mood when talking this.,1

Well made and sturdy. Didn't like that we would have to screw into the wall. There are other bells that don't require this... so we shipped this back and purchased a diff. model.,0
Quality manufactured components. Critically important to follow directions & align top to bottom. Expect problems with clips if not properly aligned. Make sure sliders are properly aligned to the wire of the adjoining panels. Fairly easy assembly.  The only negative is the Styrofoam packing material pieces end up everywhere.,1
"I was looking for a regular covered litter box because my cat is a digger and throws a lot of litter out of her uncovered box. I found many litter boxes, but I liked the idea of this one and watched the video included with one of the reviews. Now, with the ""Clevercat"" litter box, there is no litter out of the box and I hear my cat enjoying her digging inside. Not Only this box keep the area clean, but it saves litter too because nothing is wasted outside. I never thought that much litter like this was being wasted gradually as a result of my cat digging and digging. The mat like cover on the top of the box serves as a mat to trap the litter clinging to the cat's paws. I would recommend this box and I have already done so to a friend.",1
"After reading many reviews I ordered this item. It has its pros and cons.

The faucet attachment is made sturdier than the Python which just uses a waterbed fill kit with a clear hose instead of a garden hose. Be careful screwing the fine thread plastic part to your metal faucet. I don't plan on leaving the bushing on my faucet so I'll spend a couple more dollars to buy a metal bushing. Plastic to metal will strip easily.

As I read in a previous review, the hose flew off the faucet fitting spraying so I was very careful making sure I assembled & tightened it well. So... it still did it!!! I didn't have my water pressure blasting but it builds up to the same amount as soon as it's closed and whoosh it immediately flew off soaking my floors and walls also. I reassembled but it's not that great of a ferrule fitting. I also suggest opening and closing the valves slowly which I did.

If you have really fine gravel or sand this will work as a drainer/filler but not a gravel cleaner. The pressure has to be kept so low as to not suck the fine gravel into the tube then there's not enough pressure to pull up debris. Make sure you've also pulled enough water through the entire hose before filling or you'll dump the debris back into the water.

Over all I'm happy with it minus my fine gravel ordeal BUT if the hose pops off again I will be returning it. A a hose clamp won't fix the issue as the end is tapered. I could've made one for about $15 using my existing gravel cylinder and a waterbed fill kit but this one was priced reasonably.",1
Pets said YUCK!  A waste of $10.00 and no way to return!,0
"I ended up using this tent as a toy for my cat to hop in and out of when he's playing / chasing laser / etc. It was not particularly useful for the litterbox, though, and I ended up getting a covered box with a matt underneath.",1

"Boxes came (order 2) and they left them at the end of my driveway, understandably because of their weight. Set up was easy, if you know what you are doing but very time consuming. Very disappointed though in th chainlink fencing itself. Many of the top square pieces were MISSING and difficult then to use wrap-around wires to hold in place when there was nothing there. Very heavy I say to move, simple to put up or take down but quality fell short of my expetations. With being a wrap around, the animals have gotten lose several times. Able to stretch and you can not repair. Will never use this again & need 10 more. If need a kennel get one with solid panels that are strong & put together. Also was poor on keep critters out as well. Worse product I have ever bought on Amazon since Amazon began & I began purchasing from them!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!

"This is an edit of my earlier review. There appear to be some concerns about contamination in this product and other Purina products ... claims which Nestle is denying instead of investigating.

While our dogs have been eating this for years, we are switching to a different product, not because of specific problems ourselves, but because we feel that Nestle is not appropriately addressing the issue, especially in light of the recent recall of dog treats also manufactured by this company.

Our dogs health is our primary concern for re-submitting this with a single star.",0
Came broken. Buyer beware.,0
This product is a must have. I used the spray collar for the longest and hated how fast it would die out on me. The last spray collar I got bought died within a week of having it. I decided to give this collar a try and I will never go back. The green setting is the best as it gives such a small shock and increases with the amount of barks that my dog never barks more then once with it on. It surprises them the first time but don't be scared it is such a light shock that it cannot harm them. It fits so nicely and does not get in his way or pulls his neck down. I have a weenie dog.,1

Since our dog is older I want to make sure that no matter where he's laying, he has support and cushion for his joints. He loves both beds and lays on them all day (when he's not on the couch). I wash the cover almost once a week and it's held up very well. The water-proof lining also makes cleaning it so much easier. This is also one of the only beds I could find in XXL, which is awesome. It's the perfect size when he wants to sprawl out. I definitely recommend this bed and any of the 4"" memory foam ones from DogBeds4Less, I'm very happy with them.",1

"Exactly what I needed. I bought the green for price and was delighted with it. It's great for walking along roadway where there's no sidewalk and an earth tone color would blend in with the surroundings. I bought it for my 6lb Maltese who developed CHF. She seems quite content to see all her favorite sites from an elevated view. The 16lb Malti-lhasa has the opportunity to take a break during walks.

Both sit very comfortably in the space. I love the ventilation front and the viewing screen on top. The back zip is very helpful and the screened hood will be nice for summer walks. Plenty of room in the zip carry space on the bottom for leashes, water, and bowls. From the wheels up, I couldn't be more pleased.

I believe they may be expired, but since there's no date printed on the bag, I can't prove it.

I suggest that one attempts this process with cittikitty and when there is atleast two bathrooms. One for the  cat while there learning. Cause its going to get messy and you will wind up cleaning it every day for about 20 minutes just so you and your family can feel comfortable using the bathroom. If you have two bathrooms then the family can use one and the cat can you the other and if the ""cats"" bathroom is alittle extra messy its not going to bother anyone.",0
"I bought this for my puppy when he was about 6 months old, he ran through my neighbors woods and got a bunch of ticks on him (I was using Frontline at the time). I removed all of the ticks and bought this shampoo to kill any tick eggs, or ticks that I missed... it didn't help in any way, shape, or form. I found more ticks a few days later and had to remove those as well and check him twice a day for 4 days until I was sure there were no ticks.

Fast forward to last Sunday (12/16/2012) and my dog is 11 months, and he ran through my neighbors woods again. Came back and I checked him, no flees or ticks or anything, but I decided to give him a bath with this stuff anyways, just to be on the safe side. The next day, roughly 24 hours later, my pups hair was thinning, his skin was scabby and scaly, and he had random bumps all up his lower back. I didn't know what it was, he wasn't itching or acting any different, so I gave him some Benadryl and waited til the next day to see if it would get worse. It got worse. The bumps had spread all up his back and onto his legs, he was still active and acting fine but a lot of the bumps were filled with pus and his skin was starting to flake and bleed. I gave him some Benadryl again, cleaned his wounds with peroxide and did a cold compress, and took him to the vet first thing in the morning. He had a chemical burn from this stuff and it also caused some healing cuts to become infected. The vet ran some tests on him and gave him a soothing shampoo, some anti-histamine, and gave him a antibiotic shot... totaled up to $254. So my little guy will be getting a bath twice a week for 2 weeks, taking pills 3 times a day for about a week, and losing hair a lot for up to 2 weeks because this stuff is so harsh on skin.

This stuff is definitely not worth that risk. It's not even about the money, I've spent a lot more on my pup for a lot less, but the fact that he'll be in pain for up to 2 weeks while his entire body heals from chemical burns just kills me. Don't buy this, buy a tick remover and a flee comb, use a good preventative to keep flees and ticks off to being with (I now use K9 Advantix II which works great for me) and be on your merry way.",0

She didn't choke on the treat either, she died 10 hrs after eating it. It was the most violent death I have ever seen, heaving and gasping for air, and vomiting..and I was in the Marines during the Iraq war!!!! Blue Buffalo, you are forever in my sights. I hope you go bankrupt and are forced to eat the poison you so readily feed our animals. Disgrace of a company.

"I ordered this product on October 26, received it on Oct. 29, to use on my dog who is training to be a certified pet assisted therapy dog. I only used it a few times. It did not work properly each time I tried to use it. The piece that tightens under the dog's snout/throat would not lock into place. I didn't know it was defective until I asked someone at our pet therapy group meeting the following month what I was doing wrong and they were able to see it was defective. Due to some physical disabilities and resulting surgery I was not able to try to return it until now and I find I cannot return it because it is past the return time - it hasn't even been 90 days? I am now eating the cost of a defective item and having to pay, again, for another product that will work.",0
The squeaker part pops out in about 5 minutes of squeezing.  The suck.,0
the product came broken and it was clearly used by someone else. The box was all ripped up and the cat toy was all clawed up.,0
"This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.",0
"I ordered three samples of their colored sand, from their website. I was disappointed because every color had grains of sand that had the color partially missing. It looked awful because the sand is really white before it's colored. I'm afraid to order any because I don't want salt and pepper substrate. As expensive as this sand is, I would expect the quality to be better.",0
So far so Good! I can see the bb accumulating. Had it running for a month now. The slits in the plastic are small enough my shrimp can not get inside it. Love it so far!,1
this product did not work. this is just a glorified pantyliner that I could of gotten at the drugstore for less,0
"Easy to put on, and protects my power windows from droom",1
real cheap caca,0
"This was the second electric collar that I purchased, and it too is plagued by fake reviews. Don't trust any of them, unless they are from a verified buyer. This worked for about three weeks and then stopped. The remote just stopped working.

Lots of poor design elements. For example, the orange collar is wrapped in a tight circle, but backwards, so when you put it on the end sticks out. Since they are modal, the buttons are impossible to use reliably. You might mean to buzz, but you shock instead. Don't buy it.

I eventually purchased a sportsdog, which so far is working well.",0
"I love this, don't need to always refill the bowl. His just keeps it in and no worries!",1
Have been very disappointed in these filters. They only last a couple of days before gunk starts building up on them.  Do not recommend and would not use again. Do not think they are filtering water at all.,0
The large cat i got this for really likes it. The cushion is very soft (but he spends half his time under it),1
"Failed to work when it arrived, no light no noise nothing.  And apparently it is not eligible for return. So 7.50 for a black box I guess!",0
Our 11 month old Dalmatian had already chewed through the rope and canvas in 15 minutes.  Not meant for young chewers.  It would be a great toy for fetching with a dog out of the pupp stage.,0
"After $100's of dollars in vet bills, found out my dogs got really sick from eating Blue Buffalo. Do a review search on their product before you start feeding it.",0
Both that I ordered both bell n now fell apart in less then 1 day I do not recommend them to anyone,0
My cichlids hate it.,0
I purchased this through the warehouse  and it came in broken pieces . This was a waste of money and time.,0
"Only worked for a week. It could have been handy, but not when you have large dogs. I had to refill 3x a day.",0
"I love this bowl. It folds up nicely. It does take a few times to learn how to open it and keep it open. I love the clip so that I can attach it to my dog's leash or my belt. Even though I am not a proponent of bottled water,I like that I can attach it to this if I want. I love that it is BPA free too.",1
I got this toy in the mail gave it to my dog and he destroyed it in 20 mins. There is nothing left. This is not a tuff toy. The description says it is durable and has double stitching but that did not stop my dog from taring it up.,0
They had great smell and flavor (according to my dog)...but they were a little drier than i anticipated.,0
"It is true that their canned dog food would be one of the better ones on the market if it contained the ingredients listed. This company would also get much credit for sourcing and manufacturing their food in the US. At first we thought we had done a good thing switching to Evangers for our little 8 lb Shorkie.

However, not long after switching she started to have vomiting and seizures, even bleeding from the nose. So we did a quick Internet search on the food and found some very, very bad news.

Aside from the customer reports of mold and rusty cans, we found this:
Letters warning Evangers were sent by the FDA and are publicly available (read letters yourself online) about how they failed inspections by not having the ingredients listed on their cans, but something else in their food.
----------------------------------
""From December 2, 2010 through February 10, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your low-acid canned food manufacturing facility located at 221 Wheeling Road, Wheeling, Illinois. In addition, on August 19, 2010, FDA received samples of (b)(4) Lamb and Rice Dog Food from the distributor, (b)(4). This letter notifies you of the violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that we found during our inspection and from the samples we received from the distributor. You can find the FD&C Act and its associated regulations on the Internet through links on FDAs web page at www.fda.gov1.""
""We found that you offered for sale (b)(4) Lamb and Rice Dog Food which was adulterated. Under Section 402(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C.  342(b)(2), a food is deemed to be adulterated if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefore. Our analytical sample results of this product revealed that a substance (lamb) was not detected in the product [...]
""On December 14, 2010, FDA collected samples of your Evangers Grain-free Duck Pet Food during the inspection of your facility. We found that the Evangers Grain-free Duck Pet Food product was adulterated.""
-----------------------------------------

Worse even than that was the fact that in 2009 the FDA had to order a SHUTDOWN of their production:

""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today it was suspending Evanger's Dog & Cat Food Co.'s emergency permit to ship pet food because the company's procedures could allow the bacterium that causes botulism to survive in some of its products.
The FDA is stopping Evanger's ability to ship pet food in interstate commerce, said Dr. Bernadette Dunham.""
[Check that one out on Consumer Affairs web site]

---------------------------------------------------------
If all of THAT weren't bad enough, Evangers instituted a silent recall of their own food from their distributors because of the small, sharp pieces of metal found in their canned food:

""Along with the peas, carrots, rice, and chicken, Ms. E**** found sharp metal tags floating in amongst the meat and veg When Ms. E**** asked what the tags were and what in the BLEEP they were they doing in her dog food, they assured her, that a similar incident happened a couple of years ago and were surprised to hear that there were still cans of it floating around.
When Ms. E**** inquired about the extra ingredient, Evangers told her that the tags are used in the poultry industry as a means of identification and should have been removed from the chickens wings before they got used in pet food.""

---------------------------------------------------
Well, now. If that were not bad enough, there's MORE. Are you ready for this?

From Chicago News Center:

""Prosecutors charged a Lincolnwood couple today [The owners of Evangers] with illegally diverting nearly $2 million in utilities to their dog and cat food company through an elaborate scheme where [Evangers] workers performed highly dangerous maneuvers.

An employee was given a pair of rubber gloves and told to go up in a forklift to disconnect an illegal bypass attached to a high-voltage line shortly before ComEd inspectors arrived.

Another time, prosecutors say, the worker was ordered to use a jackhammer to tear up concrete and asphalt so gas could be diverted to the plant in Wheeling. The smell of gas fumes wasn't unusual at Evangers Dog & Cat Food Co.

The brazen nature of these thefts is exceeded only by the dangerous conditions that these individuals were willing to expose their employees to, said Cook County States Attorney Anita Alvarez.

Joel Sher, 54, and his wife, Holly, 52, were arrested Tuesday [the owners of Evangers]. Each was charged with felony theft and money laundering in the scheme, which allegedly had gone on for several years. The company and couple once were featured on the Rachael Ray food show.
Investigators seized $2.3 million from a Chicago bank account belonging to the Shers, as part of an ongoing money-laundering investigation related to the alleged diversion of gas and electricity, according to the states attorneys office.""

Tell you what, people, we are DONE with Evangers.",0
I  received the wrong color case! I ordered the light blue case and received a dark blue one. I am not happy about it.,0
"I purchased these at my local pet store as an alternative to Greenies. My dog liked them, but ended up having such a problem, I had to take him to the emergency vet, costing me $850 in tests to find out why he was breathing funny and acting lethargic. Turns out these things gave him such bad digestive problems, he was acting like he was going to die. That is not hyperbole. Two days afterwards, when he finally did a #2, you could not imagine what it was like. He's just now starting to feel better, but he still has bad diarrhea. Stay away from these.",0
The handle cracked and broke after one week!,0
i love using this for my basset hounds. they both have allergies but this helps them not itch and helps with the shedding too. we love it.,1

Just what I needed to keep my dog in one place while driving.,1
junk.  thermostat is way off and is getting worse.  cant get water below 82 when set at lowest temp of 56,0
Really nice. These make cutting the cats claws much easier. We sourced several cutters at local brick and mortar stores that were nowhere near as good. Mainly the stationary part tended to warp as you tried to cut. These are rock solid. A good buy.,1

"All I can tell you is when my dog (70 lb Pit Bull mix) started showing Arthritis symptoms, I turned to supplements (nutraceuticals).

I wish I could identify this particular product as key but it's one of several I give him and most are from ""Vets' Best.""

I read lables and if you read any of the product labels from Vets' Best, I'm sure you'd be pleased. Not only are they potent and in the right ratios, Vets' Best offers the quality I've come to trust and are reasonably priced.

My dog is asymptomatic today. Of course, no one can guarantee the same results but I would venture to say, there'd be improvement. You can't lose with this!

So, check out their product line. I'm confident nothing will disappointment you!",1
"What a ripoff! It's a piece of nylon with no flavor or hint of aromatic attraction.
Why would any dog chew on this, unless they chew on anything?
I saw all the happy reviews and just assumed my dog would love it.
This is the first time the Amazon Review has failed me.
Seriously, I don't understand why any dog would go for this unless they have problems interfacing with the real world.
Then I would hardly call it a ""treat""
THERE IS NO BACON FLAVOR ON THE BONE I RECEIVED",0
Bought this muzzle for my friends pit bull and it fits perfect...It took him a little while to get use to it but now he doesn't mind....he can still eat treats and drink water.,1
I wouldn'trecommend his pet traing pad because the quality no good. Also leaking trough the pad.,0
Awesome!! Easy fits my teacup 2pound yorkie easy to wash and she likes it!,1
This thing snapped in half 6 hours after I set it up. Don't waste your time or money.,0
Does the job very well.,1
Amazing hay quality and my bunnie absolutely love this stuff. And it's so packed in there that it last forever! I think the price is really reasonable compared to the crazy shipping cost on some of the other sites that deliver boxes of hay.,1
Everyone needs this product,1
"I know there are variations of thickness and weight with these sticks, but the last 2 I ordered were practically the weight and size of a pencil. My dog crunched in it for about 3 minutes. Better off to go to the pet store and be able to pick out the heavier ones, especially for the price.",0
Absolutely a work of Art by the universe,1
"I have a Maine Coon. He ripped it apart in one play session! So now instead of playing with him, I have to pick up feathers and other misc pieces off the floor that I don't want him swallowing.

The BEST purchase I have ever made! It works great and keeps the box clean at all times.,1
"I've used this recent purchase twice in 3 weeks on a small short-haired breed, along with flea baths, flea bombs, and professional spraying, and this poor dog still has fleas. I think there are products that work better, but they require a vet's prescription. I wouldn't waste my money again.",0
"This does not last more than 2 weeks, if that. Also there is a burning smell when plugged in and we can't use as we fear it's unsafe. In the past we have been able to store the refills upside down in order to get the ""wick"" saturated before using them, and that took care of the burning smell issue but it isn't working this time. These are way too expensive for the quality and possible risk and our cats are more stressed rather than less.",0
"I think it may be too loud for my cats' taste and they just wouldn't go near this ball. I think it's well-made, though.",0
This is clearly made for dogs. It is way too heavy and bulky for a cat. Totally unsuitable. Returned.,0
"This does a good job on pet's nails.  It does take some time to condition the pet to the noise.  The plastic cap may rub on the wheel, at first, but will soon be sanded down to fit correctly.",1
"I don't know if they paid for the good reviews or what but this was the worst $50 that I have ever spent. My wife bought the 5 pound bag because of the reviews and this stuff is crap. It did nothing to relieve  the itching that my dog has and his coat seems more brittle then ever before. My dog is a golden ret. and his coat was much softer before starting on this stuff. I gave it 6 weeks to see any change and the change was for the worse. This stuff is crap, and if you don't believe me try it yourself but only buy a small bag so you don't waste too much money.",0
"This is a very useful accessory for your Fluval canister filter.  This surface skimmer will remove unsightly oily build up from the surface of the water.

The surface skimmer can be adjusted to compensate for changing water levels.  As water evaporates, the water level goes down.  You can adjust this unit to compensate for changes in water level.  If the water level gets too low, the filter will start drawing in air and it will become somewhat noisy.  That is your signal to add more water.

Most filter intake tubes pull water from the middle of the water column.  That will not remove the surface film that floats on top of the water.  This oily film is not only unsightly, it also causes deposits on the side of the glass.",1
Plants are plastic not silk,0
"This Food poisoned my Lab/Pit Mix. Gave it liver damage in a week and a half. She died in two weeks ,after that ,from not eating anything.",0
"I hate cleaning litter boxes.  I really do.  I would rather clean and scrub heavily used toilets and wash a mountain of dirty dishes from strangers than mess with kitty litter.  It sounds like an over-exaggeration, but I assure that statement is entirely truthful.  I love my cat very much, but I hate cleaning its litter box.

The Cat Genie changed my life.  I've been using one since June of 2011.  When I bought it, I read that one of the biggest hurdles people had was getting their cat to use the device in the first place. One trick I read was to leave the old litter box around, but keep it next to the cat genie.  On the first night, our cat used the old litter box. I said ""screw it"" on the second day and got rid of the old kitty litter box entirely, as well as all the ""enticing"" bathroom mats on the floor.  Our cat started using the Cat Genie immediately after that point and never looked back.

It's not feasible to put this in our laundry room, as our cat is an older indoor cat and doesn't like going downstairs very much.  We keep it in our bathroom off of our master bedroom.  It is not a big hassle to flush the toilet after use.  And if people are worried about being ""grossed out"" I assure you that 1.  Immediately after a cleaning all you'll see is soapy suds inside the bowl and 2.  If you wait longer until the suds go down, the cat genie does an excellent job of breaking up the waste that it does not resemble (or smell) anything that might make you sick.

One concern I had before purchasing the unit was how loud it would be.  Especially since it was going into our master bathroom and we don't have a door between it and our bedroom (just a curtain).  I was surprised at how quiet it was.  It's about as loud as a washing machine, behind a closed door, several rooms away.  I am a light sleeper and I easily sleep through it's cleaning cycle.  My wife's ""white noise"" fan is much louder by comparison.  It's not super stealth silent, but it's not going to jar you awake either (unless you are a far lighter sleeper than me, but at that point you probably have far more things that keep you from a restful night's sleep).

In terms of maintenance, I have not had any problems with the unit breaking down in it's 1.5 year run.  Today it gave an error beep, and it turned out to be the water sensor that needed to be wiped off (it had accumulated 1.5 year's worth of watery grime).  It took me about 5 minutes to disassemble it, wipe it off, and put it back together.  I make sure to also always use the quarterly ""cleaning cartridge"" that is sold with the unit.

The only downsides to the product are that since the device uses plastic granules instead of litter that is designed to immediately mask the scent of waste, if your cat recently used the Genie and your cat's bowels are having a particularly bad day it can be a little smelly until the cleaning cycle kicks on.  Which, if you have it set to auto, will happen in 30 minutes or you can manually kick it off with the press of a button.

The other downside happens on the rare occasion that bits of waste are too small for the sifter arm to extract and after a cleaning when the drying cycle kicks in, it can make it a little smelly as well.  As I said, this is a bit on the rare side and turning on my bathroom's fan solves the problem or I just light some incense or use air freshener (if you don't mind incense, it kills the smell far more efficiently).  Usually another wash cycle will solve that problem as well.

If you're a cat owner with a regular litter box, I can promise you this:  Your home has a certain ""cat smell"" to it that other people notice.  You may not notice it, but it's there.  Ask your friends and family if you don't believe me.  With the Cat Genie, your home will never smell that way again.  Even with the downsides I mention, it will be far better than ever before.

It is worth it in every possible way.  It's a little expensive an initial investment, but I have not regretted it.  My friend decided to pick one up after seeing my results and he feels the same way.  And then a friend of my friend decided to get one as well, and... similar results for them.",1
Followed instructions but it didn't work!,0
Not even close to what I want or need . . Super thin and way too big to fit the tray. This was recommended for the litter box I have but there is no way that was correct unless I was sent the wrong thing but the box is the same so I doubt that! Terrible quality,0
Too small,0
Only comes with a big piece of cardboard I just ordered yesterday let my kitten get it and it just kept sliding around he couldn't even use it I thought it would have had a outer shell to hold it in so it don't slide as bad but completely worthless,0
My dog loved this Kong Squeeze Crackle Bone but it only lasted 1.5 months before he put a hole in it which is upsetting since its one of his favorite toys. Very upset that a Kong product didn't last long!!!,0
"This product is awful!! I have had the LitterMaid self cleaning box before and really liked it. When I was in the market for a new box, I came across this one. It was pretty spendy, but the reviews were so good I decided to take a chance on it. It's awful. The crystals come in a flimsy cardboard box, the rake doesn't get rid of the poo properly, but most of all, the entire room smells like urine, always. Oh, and the crystals cost a fortune. I cannot believe I wasted all that money. I'm ready to throw it away and go back to scooping the litter myself.",0
Very pleased with the quality of this vest - fully adjustable - great value - highly recommend!,1
"Amazing! I've had so much fun placing them in jars I picked up in Paris and giving them to friends as gifts. Everyone should have a marimo in their home. Thank you so kindly for the extras. They have made our home so very special. Thank you, thank you!! I will be sure to order from you again!",1
"They good,packaging not good, lost most the liquid content",0
sister is still trying to get her dog to chase the ball - guess he wants all the balls that are loaded on the gun launcher,1

"Blanket runs about 2 sizes to small, I won't purchase another Derby Original ever. Size 82 is more like a size 78",0
"These are great bags and the price is right.
I have two Aussies and have never had any issues with them.",1
"German shepherd has split open a ball on the seem after 6 months of use. Heavier than what I expected too. She doesn't really like to retrieve it either. Again, thing bigger/heavier than what she usually likes to run around with. More durable than most toys, but she prefers a ball.",0
Too thin!,0
Works great,1
"I purchased this extra large cage for a giant breed puppy to grown into.  The cage is a LOT flimsier than previously purchased crates.  I'm not confident this will hold in an extra large animal.  Difficult getting latches to work (lock or unlock).  It seems like things don't line up properly.  Bars on crate are easily bent.

On a plus note, having 3 doors works well being able to put one dog on each side of the divider.  I wouldn't leave them in there together without supervision though.  Just not sturdy.",0
Works well.,1
"I ordered the extra small, which is supposed to be 18"" x 12"". The bed is *barely* 16"" x 11"" even though the tag on the bed does list 12"" x 18"". It's a good price, so I just wish I'd known the true size so I would have ordered a bigger one.",0
"We thought this bowl would be the answer to our prayers in slowing the eating of our very food-motivated hound dog.  Unfortunately she was so frustrated by getting her food she turned incredibly aggressive at feeding times, NOT typical of her at all.  She growled at my husband and myself on a few occasions and even tried to bite me when I pulled the bowl away from here.  Not worth the liability for our household.  That being said, I know others who use the bowl with great success, just didn't work for our pup.",0
My dog loved these treats!  We got them for $1 a bag (3.5oz).  The price on Amazon is high.,1
Didn't last 2 weeks.,0
"We re-did a back room into a guest room and our cat did NOT like the change. He started biting and scratching at the carpet! I was pissed. We were asking around to see if anyone wanted a cat. Got this spray and it's only been 2 days- but WOW! He's hanging out in the back room, purring, happy as can be. Just sprayed this stuff around the area he was scratching and he hasn't touched it again since. Very happy! :)",1
Our sensitive cat (with thyroid and kidney problems) was refusing to eat anything solid for a while; we tried this and he hated it.  He wouldn't even eat other gravy/bisque that he normally liked if this was near it.,0
"I was so excited to make this for my Boxer for his birthday b/c he really loves peanut butter. He loved it (but he'll eat anything). Unfortunately, it gave my dog really bad diarrhea.",0
"Received the item early. Consider myself lucky to have gotten it. Item was shipped loose in a plastic mailer/sack and had ripped open one end of the mailer. Our mail carrier left it in the mailbox in two pieces.

As to the tweezers, they are lighter than the super cheapo 100 pennies store one we purchased several years ago. Bought this one because of the bend in the tines. However, that lightness and where the bend is causes a bit of a problem. If you put too much pressure on the tweezer, it actually opens up again - it meets at the bend and the tips separate. It does have a fairly tight hold though when squeezed tight enough to close the tips but not so hard as to meet at the bend. Considering it's designed for working with plants, forcing the operator to have a soft touch probably isn't a bad thing. But, it will take a little getting used to.

Haven't had it long enough to comment on durability but I like the overall light-weight-ness of it.",1
"We take our dog for a weekly running club's night run and with the standard retractable leash, you would loose track of her.  This one is plenty bright enough - good safety for her and the runners around.  At $10, much cheaper than the products in the local big box stores.",1

fit very well,1
This mat does every thing it is designed to do at a very cheap price.  Great quality.  We are very happy.,1
"These bags are large enough to pick up after two medium sized (42 pound each) dogs with one bag. I like that they are wide enough double as cat scoop bags, too. It is easy to find the perforations and separate the bags without effort at the perforations. The bags are tough enough for the job and I have not had one tear or get a hole yet. Figuring out which end opens is not difficult and getting the bag to open is not a struggle, even with one hand. Best of all is the price per bag is less than any other types of bags that I've tried. They do come on single wide roll, so there is no storing of a roll of bags in your pocket. I take a couple of them with me for each walk, just in case. They do offer the same brand in smaller rolls, but the bags are a different size. The lavender scent is pleasant, but not overpowering. I highly recommend these to my friends. That they are more biodegradable than other brands makes me feel less guilty about tossing one or two of these into the trash each day.",1
I bought this to see if my cats would like it better then other food I had been giving them. They devoured it and seemed to have more energy on this food.,1
"After reading the other reviews, perhaps I should have bought the large, very over-priced Chuck It because when I try throwing a ball from the smaller sized (and overpriced) Chuck It, our dogs (small terrier mixes) have already run farther than the ball will go. We had a ball thrower we purchased at a Dollar General-type store that had a much longer range. It was stepped on (by a human) and broken - all we've been able to find since are the Chuckits. Bought one in desperation to have something and have regretted it ever since.",0
Dangerous for your pooch. And breaks easily.,0
The best ingredients,1
"These worked for the first couple of days to tell the puppies, apart but ended up being terrible.  4 puppies ended up with cuts on their neck or shoulder from these digging into them.  We took them off immediately and tossed them in the garbage.  I'm just glad we caught it before it could have done more damage to them.  If you are going to buy these be very careful and keep a close eye on your puppies.",0
My pup chewed through this is 5 minutes of opening it.,0
Good for a short distance from the dog's mouth. Didn't work after our dog had a spot near her tail. :(,0
"I like this. Serves its purpose....to stop litter being thrown out of the box. But, the cat isn't as crazy about it as I am. Left the old one next to this one to let it get familiar with the new facilities, but cat preferred the old one. Sure that is just because of habit, and don't see any problem with the total switch over. I would recommend this. Great price for a time saving product.",1
"My Yorkie started having stomach problems a year ago which the vet said was IBS (who would have thought dogs could have IBS, right?) due to old age. I tried the medication they gave me, as well as super expensive grain free dog foods. None of them ever worked. That being said, this dog food (the Just 6 lamb version) 'fixed' his stomach issues. No more diarrhea one day and constipation the next. I will say that once I ran out of the first bag I tried a different kind of Rachael Ray dog food (chicken) and he had the same issues as before. After switching back to this, he was good again after a few days.",1
Didn't last very long...both my dogs torn into it just to get to the plastic squeeker so I won't buy again just because it doesn't last with chewing dogs...,0
"I've Gottem other chips that were  basted  before but these ones the coloring comes off instantly and gets all over everything not very satisfied for USA product dogs still ate it, but be ready for stains/mess",0
Cat knocks it right over. Too flimsy for purpose.,0
"Do not buy this one! You think you're getting a bigger size but you're not. This bottle is smaller 15.2 oz than the 16oz bottle for double the price! Misleading title got me with Economy Size, thought I was getting a bigger bottle at a higher price.",0
"I buy these Loofa dogs a lot. For two reasons... Our dog LOVES them and they come apart quickly so I need replacements. Our dog is small, but she is part Terrier. I do think the toys should last a little longer...this latest one lasted less than two minutes. But these toys bring joy to our dogs. Have a needle and thread handy for repairs and order it. :)",1
"I tried the item on my horses sarcoids in her ear and on her stomach, but since applying it one time, I have not been able to touch my horses ears again nor am I able to put it on the sarcoid on her stomach without getting kicked. This is a horse I can normally handle in any way, and worm without even a halter. So the money was a waste for me",0
I bought 2 - one worked but the gauge is off 3 units the other doesn't work at all!  Don't bother,0
"This does not stop the barking 100% but I did not expect it to, but it does work. I have 2 very large dogs and they don't bark constantly now when someone comes in the driveway or goes by the house. I am satisfied with the purchase.",1
"This item did not pick up cat hair they way it was advertised too, and one of the prongs did not hold up through the first use.  I would not buy it again.",0
omg people do not buy this danger bought it and used it on my 12 pound maltipoo all of a sudden she started vomiting and running around like crazy and now after three days of scratching and chewing on her skin and making bad sores on her skin still she is crying and scratching I had to go to store to but her a shirt to put on her little body so she does not rip any of her skin off This company should be sued! How can u people sell this stuff you people are heartless not hartz less u should have on label kills fleas ticks and dogs I am not kidding or a nut job either just go on Internet and read about it ok?,0
I wish I'd know about these years ago. I bought all 3 cats one and the dog one.  No fleas!,1
"I have used these bottles before to nurse kittens and they worked out really well. This time I bought them, along with several other items, to donate to an animal rescue group. Everything was delivered on time and I am very satisfied with the order.",1
"this is a dandy little shaver.  I run a licensed cat rescue here in north idaho with approdx 125 cats. very often i have to shave off the matts and this little shaver is like a hot knife through butter. a little shaver for some really tough jobs.  thankyou Wahl,  michael sowders",1
My dogs LOVE this stuff. They act like it's the best treat they've ever eaten - they get a little crazy when I take this tub out.  It's kind of expensive at $1.40 an ounce but I save 15% getting it on the Subscribe and Save program. I found out about it from the vet. It can be a great training treat because it comes as small squares.,1
it works it is gravel paper what can I say !,1
Very cute. Not as strong as I had hoped for but it does work well and holds my dog up so he can be secure and look out the window.,1
This is an excellent quality dog bed.  I love the fact that the cover is removable for washing.,1
Our curious and food movitated cats figured out how to open the  lid in no time. They had a feast for the first meal and went hungry for the rest of the day.,0
"Very, very thin. Might be ok for very, very small dog. I could triple the amount of foam and still have room in the cushion. And that's about what you would need to make a decent bed for a large dog. The cover does not look durable and the foam is way too thin. I suggest you spend more money and get a bed that will be comfortable for your dog and last more than a month. Very disappointed.",0
It doesnt work for neuter surgery. I felt so bad for my poor guy with the e collar so I got this. It didn't do anything to keep him from licking the surgery site.,0
Been feeding my boxer blue since he was a puppy and he has been very healthy. He is 4 now and I've been feeding his puppies blue for about 6 months and same as well. Their coats get so shiny and their fur is still soft. Nobody else I've met has a dog with fur as theirs. I give them a bath at most once a month and brush em the same amount so I believe that blue is the one to thank.,1
Will use this blade often so far very good,1
Smaller than I expected.  The wood is pretty solid and it looks ok but the fasteners were nearly impossible to tighten down and I doubt I can move it far with out the whole thing coming apart like a card house. Not expecting it to last very long.  Needed to get a smaller litter tray to fit.,0
Gave my dog the tablet.  No side affects & has eradicated her fleas.,1
PERFECT FOR NEWFOUNDLANDS!,1
Very small. I use it for a chick brooder.,0
Works perfect on my 55 gallon. Came on time. Does exactly what it said it was going to do and haven't had an issues yet. I wish they made the same product for all tank sizes. I would buy more.,1
"When I ordered it, I accidentally ordered the wrong size. I did not reorder because the one they sent me was just too flimsey. A big puff of wind would blow the house and dog away. I went with a totally different type.",0
My dogs LOVE these bully sticks!,1
Works awesome battery is great and has helped my dog well and I love how it has so many different features and functions,1
Does not work....tried several times and no crickets:(,0
"So far so good, my dogs love it. I ordered 2, one purple one grey. Theyre very difficult to put together, but seems super sturdy once its done. My 105lb American stafforshire and 67lb pitbull don't seem to phase them though.
UPDATE: We have only had these beds for about 3 weeks and had to order a replacement part for one bed, one of the connectors snapped (see pics) and they sent me a used one thats already got stress points on it and had gouges in the ring from previous assembly! And the second bed, the purple one, for the small dog, who is only about 55% of the weight limit on the bed, is splitting at the seams. This seemed like a great purchase, but in less than a month was a waste of $100.",0
"We've had our Litter Genie for roughly three years now. We bought it at a pet store rather than Amazon, but my fiance and I love this thing so much I had to write a review anyway when it popped up in my window shopping. You wouldn't think something this simple would make such a difference... Scooping waste into this funny little trash can rather than a regular one. Or into a shopping bag, like we used to do. Yet this turned out to be incredibly convenient!

It holds A LOT of waste. Our kitty is huge and he poops/pees like a champion. There have been a couple of times where I had to gently shake the Litter Genie from side to side to get a particularly enormous boulder to go down, but it wasn't too much trouble and didn't make a mess.

There's no odor. You'd never know there was anything in there.

Being able to just pull out the bag and tie it off when it's finally full is really nice. This saves so many trips to the trash can. I can't recommend this enough. If you have an indoor cat and you're not wealthy enough to afford some $400 robot litterbox, you really owe it to yourself to buy this.",1
"Excellent workmanship...perfect for a hotel, especially during hurricane season!  Only problem is that my dog won't go in it!!",1
I did not realize this CAT food would be filled with whole peas and visible carrots among other veggies. My cats thought I was nuts trying to feed them this stuff.,0
"exactly as expected, easy to put together.",1
We have a 100 lbs. Weimaraner who loves to chew on things. We searched for almost a year to find a toy that he wouldn't immediately shred into pieces. This is the ONLY toy (out of 50+ toys) he has not been able to destroy. We will definitely continue to purchase with this company!,1
Exactly as pictured. Perfect for my kitten who tries to kick litter over the sides.,1
My product arrived in poor condition. The inner lining was torn from the canvas shell.,0
My dog loves it!,1
A must if you have two mischievous  dogs,1
"The sweater is a decent quality for the price. HOWEVER, it had a TERRIBLE scent. We hand washed it immediately twice, and then it was ok. But really, it was pretty yucky. It didn't have a ""new sweater"" scent...it was more like really stinky stagnant water. We would have returned it if it wasn't Xmas eve. I won't buy another one.",0
"very cute bag, I get lots of compliments on it. It however doesn't fit all my grooming essentials. I am a professional groomer and carry this bag to work everyday. I've had it a little over a month and already need a new bag. The straps have torn off and the zipper broke. Clearly not intended for heavy use. I would recommend for someone with only a few grooming essentials, but not for someone who carries everything in one bag.",0
"I have bought several of these shields. I have an unusual breed of dog that is very destructive and the shields usually last a couple of months before he finally figures a way to pull them down. However, the last one I bought was nothing like the other ones, it was a really heavy green colored plastic that refused to straighten out from where it was rolled up. I left it on our pool table for several days with books holding it down and it still rolled right back up. It was difficult to cut, difficult to manage and the 3M sticky tabs, which were almost impossible to peel the red side off, were no match for the rolling power of the plastic. The stiff plastic pulled the sticky squares right off. My Basenji had it torn to shreds within 12 hours of putting it up. So, the pretty good product that I have purchased several times has been replaced by a piece of junk. I won't waste my money again. I plan to see if one of the craft stores can sell me a piece of plastic.",0
This is excellent!!!!! I have the other one too but my dog doesn't like to walk in it.  This one fits perfectly and dogs of every size can use it.  It does not restrain my dog's leg too much and I think she is more comfortable with this one on when she does walk.,1
My dog did not like it at all.,0
"Our senior cat loves this bed.  When colder weather came,  she was getting in bed with her humans to start warm, so I bought this for her.  She sleeps in This toasty bed all night... so glad I purchased this for her!!!",1
"I bought this comb based on the reviews after being unable to find a replacement blade for the Furminator that I've been using  for 6 yrs.

The comb does work which is why I gave it 2 stars, but even right out of the package it still didn't work as well as my well used 6yr old Furminator. In fact, I did a test section on the side of my dog (see picture) and used this DakPets comb until it stopped collecting any fur, and then went over the same small section with my old comb & it picked up a good deal more.

I know that a dog's skin if different than a humans, but I always test products like this on myself before using them on my pup & the DakPets comb felt a bit sharp; not enough that I was concerned about using it on her, but I was extra careful.

The quality and user comfort of this comb is far from what I'm use to. It was considerably less expensive than the name brand comb, but I'm going to return it and keep using my old comb until I can replace it with another Furminator.

Photos: Blue is DakPets, Yellow is Old Furminator. The fur in the pictures is from using the DakPets comb until it no longer collected fur & then the smaller pile is the fur the old comb picked up that the blue comb couldn't. The pup is to show the length of the fur I'm working with.",0
Good replacement door!,1
"One of the press studs wouldn't fasten, but the collar did stay on the dog. It is softer around the neck than a regular plastic cone.",0
"My dog loves this bed! He weighs about 60 lbs so I got him the large size, which is perfect! The removeable machine washable cover is by far the best part!",1
"I have a Netherland Dwarf/Lionhead mix bunny and he has the softest fur I have ever felt and that means everything sticks to him, I first tried different types of bedding and it was still all over him. Then I found this. It's perfect! I clean it every other day he doesn't pee anywhere else, which is great, I keep hay in one corner so he always has clean hay to eat (since he's in there eating the hay and he does his business at the opposite end). I first started with the smaller scatterless litter box and it was good when he was small but I had to upgrade to the Jumbo, and it's just right for him (He's a very small rabbit though, he's only about 2.5 pounds, maybe)",1
"This works very well for our clan of critters. No skid. Top shelf of dishwasher, easy clean. Low enough for cats to use.",1
"Pro: Good size, earth friendly.
Cons: These bags stink, they smell nothing like lavender, just a overpowering bad smell.",0
Clip broke 10 minutes into our walk,0
one week ago this product stopped working. don't waste your money. I reccomend other people not to buy this product until it makes this product more better.,0
"My planted tank had a problem with the cherry shrimp being sucked into the filter, these fit and I haven't seen a shrimp in the filter since.",1
"It was impossible to get three drops in each eye twice a day. Our cat wasn't having it.
He much prefers puralube vet ointment and lets my husband put it in everyday as needed.
His eyes are cleared up now.",0
"The mat came folded and after a few days, it cracked in the spots where it was folded. Rubber should not be folded but instead rolled. If this would have been done, there would be no issues afterwards.
I am very disappointed and I would given 0 stars, if possible.",0
Great! They love them.,1
excellent patch,1
"NOT ANDIS BRAND.
I should have known from the product description that spells Andis as ANDES, but alas. This is made in China under the AODA brand (the Andis 7.5"" Steel Comb #65730 is made in Taiwan).
The teeth are crooked and not rounded at the bottom, unlike Andis. Will try this on my very curly Schnoodle but probably going to return for the real deal.

Underpowered! Anything fine sucked up causes motor to stop,0
Great size for little dogs.  My dog loves them and all the work is done getting them to a size that the dog can handle. No more cutting or breaking the larger sticks.,1
All I got was the squeaky plastic piece--no frog in the package,0
My Yorki/Dachshund mix got her head stuck in this toy. Her head was threw 2 of the holes and she couldn't get it out. I had a hard time getting her head out and it was sad :(,0
I was surprised how well the clippers worked.  The price was reasonable & came with a case .  I would recommend this to anyone,1
Great Price..Better than Walmart,1
This is really cute but the size chart is off! I followed the advice of other reviewers and got a bigger size for my Jack Russell terrier. I got him a large and it was HUGE on him- super long and also too big around the belly. He's 13 pounds and 19 inches from his neck to his tail. So against all the other reviewers I'd say get a SMALLER size than what you think you need.,1
My doggie had an allergic reaction and it made her itching worse.,0
"My 13 lb border terrier took 3 bites of the ""small"" 'ilio treat(for up to 20 lb. dogs) & it was gone. Absolutelyof NO benifit to his teeth & gums.
Biggest waste of $$ ever.
Only good thing.. apparently it tasted good. Thankfully it was not purchased at Amazon.",0
"While it's adorable in appearance, this thing will not stay on my cat. I thought he was being sneaky about getting out of it until I reattached it one day saw him walk two feet and it fell off on its own. Definitely not worth the money.",0
"Great stuff! It's also good to use with bunny rabbits if you have a litter-trained furry friend. It's not toxic to rabbits like the other soft-wood litters (may cause liver disease). And it doesn't get inhaled and stuck like clay/clumping litters.

Great stuff. It's lasted me over a year with two leopard geckos!!,1
"I love this product, but ... the medium was too small. Also, it did not come on time, so I asked for a return.  I will buy this item again!  I would recommend Simplyshe SimplyWag Dog Body Harness AND AmazonSmile to any and everyone!",1
"The clip pushes in when attaching to a collar/harness (instead of sliding down), this makes it difficult to unhook the leash for the collar/harness.  Otherwise it is a decent leash.",0
"It's an ok leash for ten bucks, however it does cut your hands.",0
"Dog got out of it too many times, had it as tight as I could get it",0
Not for my finicky dogs.,0
"Unless you enjoy the smell of rank urine, your dogs are going to have to chew on these in another room, and you're going to have to store them in a sealed bag (and I don't just mean any sealed bag). That aside, the dogs like them--unfortunately, they can't like them and me at the same time.

Have to revise my review. The odor is so disgusting that I'm throwing these away after dry sealing them. I think my dogs are belching the stink. I don't believe these bully sticks have been properly cleaned. They are offensive.",0
My cat loves these toys! She chases the yellow feathers and carries the larger black feathers around like she's caught a bird. She drops it at my feet to tell me she's made her kill and is ready to eat!,1
Broken on receipt,0
I love it . But the pump went out and i cant find the right size replacement  for it.,0
"My cat loved this toy, but sadly, it stopped working within  a week.",0
"Came cracked. It's nice enough,  slows down evaporation.",0
Strangely my cat is addicted to these balls,1
Does not kill fleas on my animals. I am not sure why.,0
"My dogs love it, but when I received it in the mail, it had leaked over everything. 1/2 of it was gone.",0
"My dog loves them, of course he loves most cookies :-)",1
"We got our lab-shepherd mix two of these for Christmas, because he is able to puncture and rip apart tennis balls.  These are described as ""tougher and safer than tennis balls""  They are most definitely NOT.  It takes our dog around an hour or two to destroy a standard tennis ball.  He was able to rip the skin off the outside of these in under two minutes, and had the soccer ball split in two in less than ten minutes.  The 8-ball lasted an even shorter amount of time.  I couldn't believe it.",0
"Even though I purchased the smallest one you had, it was still too big for my dog",0
Works pretty good but is small.,1
"These dog toys have a ""Tuffy"" rating system of 1 to 10, with 10 described as being the most durable.  This rabbit is rated a 9.  In reality, the 9 turned out to be the approximate number of minutes it lasted before our 7 month old Doberman puppy wore a hole through it's body.  So... $26 for a dog toy that lasted about 9 minutes - does that sound like a good experience to you?
I strongly suggest that you save your money, folks.  Or maybe just feed it to the dog a dollar at a time.  It'll be gone is about the same length of time!",0
"My mini longhair dachshunds  love this on top of their dog food.
I usually grill boneless chicken breast for them to cut up and add to their dog food.
One of my three dachshunds is a very picky eater.
I tried this as a healthy nutritious substitute for when I'm going out to dinner and not cooking at home.
I think they might like this better than grilled chicken breast.",1
Fast and at a very reasonable price,1
"Best training harness /lead set I have ever used! It's wonderful to have so many options when you have the leads as well. My dogs no longer pull and it is a pleasure to loose leash walk the 3 them, and we owe it all to the Freedom No-Pull Harness!",1
Love it but it was too small for my dog. Will be ordering a larger size for sure!,1
"My dog had horrible breath, I took him to the vet recently because it was so bad. This did help along with other Nylabone items. I'll  continue to use this and other Nylabone items to keep his mouth fresh and healthy!",1
uglyiest things ever. they don't stay on for even 5 min unless u want to cut ur dogs blood supply! LOL waste of money in my opinion.,0
Torn up in an hour of having it. Wouldn't buy this again.,0
Received the nail grinder today. I inserted the batteries that came with the item and it would not turn on. I thought it might have just been the batteries so I put new batteries of my own in it and the grinder still did not turn on. Returning today.,0
"My dogs caught onto these steps quicker than I thought they would.
Now I don't have to worry about my two boys getting hurt from trying to get up and
down from my bed.",1
Has some design issues.  The rake doesn't travel far enough over the waste bin so the waste would just fall backward into the clean litter...,0
"Bought this September 5 and it worked great til November 11 when it died. Now I have a cloudy tank and no up sterilizer to clean it up. I continuously run mine to keep the tank clean at all times. This was bought from ""want's that!""",0
"this was literally the most disgusting, worst litter ever purchased. It becomes like wet, nasty cat pee glue, one huge clump in the litter box. Had to dump the entire thing and start over after 3 days.",0
"Towards the end of his life, my dog was taking various pills 3 times a day. Pill Pockets were a lifesaver. Before we started buying these, we had a difficult time getting him to take his medicine every day. He would even refuse it when tucked into a piece of chicken (in his defense, the pills smelled awful - they probably tasted just the same). But once we started giving him the Pill Pockets, he never turned his nose up at his medicine again. The peanut butter ones were his favorite, and he would get excited once he saw the box of them arrive at our house. Unfortunately he passed away a few months ago, so I probably won't be purchasing these again for a very long time, but I highly recommend them to anyone else with a medicine-dependent dog. The ones sized for capsules are good for fitting 2 or 3 smaller pills into one pocket, therefore making the pack last longer. But for longer capsules you may have to use one pocket on each end and seal in the middle to fully disguise the medicine; they stick together well with just a quick pinch.",1
Works for hanging under chairs only,0
"Light weight and retracts easily. You simply push the button on top if you want it to stop coming out and let go when you want it to retract again. Has been great for late night potty breaks when I don't want to walk all over the yard in the dark or when it's raining and allows more freedom and less pulling from the dog during walks, as she's happier being able to go where she wants to go. Would buy again.",1
Quick arrival and exactly what I hoped for! Always a great purchase with GoGo!! Will continue to be a loyal customer.,1
"Our cat absolutely loves this cat tree! It was pretty easy to assemble and feels pretty sturdy. The fabric that covers it is nice and soft, and I can tell by how the cat curls up on it that he likes it too. I was afraid that the top platforms and the little box houses would be too small, but they actually fit our cat perfectly! He is a smaller adult cat though, so owners of larger cats may want to look at the dimensions and judge for themselves.

The construction quality was great with ours, however there were several small strings of hot glue left over from manufacturing. But it easily took just a few seconds to pick them all off so the cat wouldn't be tempted to lick or bite at them. I would also recommend giving the cat tree a good vacuuming to remove the extra fluff left over by the fabric. Both of these issues were too minor to invalidate the 5 star rating. This is a great cat tree and a great price for it!",1
"The dog hates it and can manage to get the snout loop off within minutes. As a result, this product doesn't work in stopping the dog from pulling.",0
Was not correct size. Large should be a small,0
It's cute but SO annoying.  It is being re-gifted throughout our family now as a joke.  No one wants it around. lol,0
I had no idea how much our 15 year old Yorkie was getting away with until the first night with his belt.  He is blind and deaf but was managing to tinkle all over the house. I highly recommend this belt. He doesn't mind it a bit and it looks pretty cute!,1
These worked for about a month. Now they do not work at all. its disappointing. I would research better products that last before purchasing.,0
Aweful/constant clicking noise in locked position as pet pulls on leash,0
These are cute but are for sure made for teacup fur babies. the strap that goes around the pets neck is made of elastic and doesn't have much moving space to adjust. The light button was hard to find and once you find it it's very hard to turn off & on. I wouldn't purchase again due to size and strap that holds onto dogs neck to tight!!,0
"Great stand for my Biocube, I love it.",1
This really helps with doggy odors between baths. Our dog gets a little stinky running around outside and stuff and this freshens here up when you can't constantly be bathing them.,1
"This is the perfect cage for Rango my pet Chameleon. It is constructed with thought in mind and was easy to put together.
It is also easy to clean with the bottom door and the hinges are well made.
I would buy again in a heart beat.",1
Great quality but per other reviews I got the bigger one but it doesn't fit my Toyota Tacoma or Camry.,1
Dog wouldn't eat it,0
I love my Furbo camera. Really helps me keep in touch with my pup while at work. Only complaints are that the treat shooter jams up sometimes and the app and software have some bugs and inconsistencies.,1
"These are great bags, actually use them for the cat box as they are large enough to get the scoop into the bag. Very sturdy and strong.
Your order came as expected, on time and in great shape. Thank you.",1
Very short,0
purchased as a gift for a friend with small dogs and she uses these all the time.,1
"My two furry princesses absolutely adore these chewies! I can never run out because my Aussie has an internal clock and she knows exactly when ""chewie time"" rolls around in the evening. She will not leave me alone until I give her one. The little Beagle princess is happy to join in, although she's not such a pest. The cost is higher than rawhide chews Made in China, but the peace of mind is worth it. I know my girls are getting a quality USA product and it's good for their teeth. I rotate between the different flavors (peanut butter, beef and chicken wrapped) for variety, but they love all of them. Even though these are made for small dogs, they are perfect for both my large and small breeds.",1
Great Buy!,1
"Nice long leash , soft handle and strong , arrived on time , well packaged",1
Gave diarrhea due to fiber in sweet potatoes,0
DID NOTHING. I GET BETTER RESULTS WITH WATER AND VINAGER.....,0

"Beautiful bowls, perfect size for kittens, and easy to clean.",1
"OK...We have two large dogs (Blue Healer and German Shorthair) and there is always dog hair EVERYWHERE!!  The Healer sheds once a year, (unfortunately it is for 365 days at a time), leaves an endless trail of hair and needs brushed constantly.  I typically use a horse brush on him as his hair is so thick and there is so much of it, but I cannot get that anywhere near the other dog as he hates it with having so much less hair.  I have been looking for a product I can use on both dogs and was given the opportunity to review this at a reduced cost for my honest review, which was easy to do for this product! This product worked well on both dogs and even the shorthair just laid there and let me brush him.  I even got this look that clearly said, ""Mom do not stop"" when using the massaging side of the glove.  I have posted before and after pictures before showing the results with less than a minute of brushing our Healer.  As you can see the glove did an amazing job.  I love the fact that it is a glove so I can brush them while petting them.  The massage side was very easy to clean off, but what really surprised me was that so was the cloth side.  I simply took another cloth and rubbed it from top to bottom in a few repetitive movements and all of the hair came off.  It also looks like it would wash up well although I have not tried that as it does not need it at this point.  I used the cloth side to wipe off the couch as well as on the dogs and it worked well there as well.  Can't wait to try it the next time I wear black pants and sit on the couch before work!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with pets!",1
We use this product because we have a very gassy bred dog. This food dressed with a little cheap olive oil - no more gas (I'm being polite.). What more could we want other than no corn food.,1
My cat loves this chicken! And on Amazon it is a great value that I can indulge Bosco on a regular basis!,1
I was real pleased with the product and the amount of time it got here. I would order again. well pleased.,1
"My dog absolutely loves this toy! She is 43 lbs and loves to chew, she has had a classic kong for over a year still in tact and I bought this one for her. It arrived yesterday and she literally has spent almost every minute on it. I put treats in it and she is still trying to get them out lol. She doesn't give up too easily. It kept her busy for like 2 hours yesterday when I was occupied with business. I recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that either loves to chew or wants them to be occupied for a few hours. My dog was so excited and happy for her new toy that she came and gave me kisses, her way of saying thank you.",1
"This worked awesome for a few days.  Then stopped.  Now it is too late to return.  I am disappointed as I love Amazon as a place to do easy returns.,",0
THEY ARE AWSOME...LOVE THE SQUEEKKKKK,0
Watch your dog carefully.  Knee cap breaks into pieces.  After it got smaller she swallowed it.  I hope she doesn't need surgery to unstop her bowel.,0
"Much larger than we expected which was nice, and very high quality, but it does not contain the bedding whatsoever.  So while the size is nice, it means that much more bedding all over the place.",0
Wouldn't recommend this product.  My gelding tore it within a week.  Unfortunately it didn't tear along a seam so it is trashed.,0
It broke in the tank after only having it for less than a month.,0
"Can't get our dog to use it, so it turned out to be a waste of money on our part.  The quality is nice but it started to die after about a week.  Product is great if you can get your dog to use it.  He just prefers the outdoors.",0
"I've had this item for over a year now and I would say it does work but depends on how it's used.  Originally I bought it to control the constant barking of a neighbor's small dog.  It seemed to be somewhat hit and miss on that guy.  It gets the dog's attention but if the dog is really intent on barking, it seems to work only half the time.  Either that or the device is really better suited to indoor use.

However, this device is definitely effective if used indoors and to control a dog from biting/licking itself raw.  I consistently use it for one of our dogs, and every time she tries to bite an old scab, one press of this device and she stops immediately.",1
My girl dog vomited every time she ate one of the oxtails.,0
"Would be a great gate if all the parts came with it. It is wide enough to fit the area I wanted it for, and the wood and metal are well made. My problem is with the plastic put together legs that came with no screws.

"It is a good product but the cost comes when you would use it as a ' though the wall ' unit. I had to fabricate a 9"" 'bolt' to fit the unit and used carpet to trim the inside, but it worked well. The dogs are still a little skittish about the double door flap, but they are getting used to it, and it's a good design for weather.",1
Easy to install.  Works great.  Would buy again..,1
"Smh, nothing special, and it broke after a month when the buckle let go. The ring in the front slides too easily,then it is not centered on the chest. Also, the hook closure that attaches the harness to the collar comes undone on every walk. It is not expensive, but didn't last.",0
On one of my cats it gagged her. Very difficult to get off. Caused a bald spot on my other cats neck where it was on his neck.,0
"So I have these little catnip fabric ishies I bought in bulk, but unfortunately he was only interested in them for like 10 minutes and they didn't do anything for him after that. I bough this to spray on the fishies, but he could care less. Money wasted oh well.",0
"Won't hold more than a dribble, better off buying feminine napkins.",0
"Buyer take note & read description. (my mistake) Despite photo shows holder w/blade. It is only the blades, $15 for blades ridiculous. Misrepresented",0
"Beware, product caused a blockage in my dog's small intestine.  We took him to the vet after he threw up a decent amount of string from the product and was displaying a lack of interest in eating.  We'll be staying away from products like this in the future.",0
My 4 month old puppy destroyed it in less than an hour,0
It's natural and smells great. It is the only product that kills the fleas instantly.,1
Not useful inside of home,0
These are terrible.  The have changes the thickness of the plastic.  We used the previous product for years and never had a problem.  Our single cat now tears a hole almost every week.  Won' buy these again.,0
"Without a car of our own the small size and light weight of the Incline Scratcher seemed like definite features (as did the price!), so we happily took one home. Our pair of boisterous Bengals enjoyed poking at the paper pom-pom inside, and were intrigued by the scratching surface. But when they tried leaning on it to sharpen their claws it slid right out from under them or tipped over, despite being braced in a corner of the room. That was enough for SisterCat - she wasn't interested in going near it again, no matter how much we coaxed or cajoled.

We tried weighing it down firmly, and BrotherCat gave it another go... at which point his claws caught in the cardboard and he ended up pulling the entire scratching-pad out from the main structure. That was it for him. We've kept it around just in case, but it's just been gathering dust - neither cat showed any interest again.

We ended up with an Armarkat Cat Tree, and a scratching mat. Both do a far better job of standing up to the energetic feline pair and their antics.

I do like the concept of the Incline Scratcher - it's clever, environmentally-friendly and affordable - though I can see it leading to cardboard scraps all over the floor if it's actually used. It might be good for kittens or small cats - I'll probably donate it to kitten rescue or the like.

Unfortunately, though, this product is just not up to the force a largish, active cat can apply.",0
We bought this to store dog food since it is air tight with a lid and has wheels. However the plastic is so cheap that it broke after only a week.  The main body cracked right under the lid.  The lid didn't break so we aren't even sure if maybe it came defective and we didn't notice it at first.,0
It is cute my dog reba loves the outfit . But bit doesn't long I had to see her outfit 3 times.cheaply  dog clothes don't know if I should wash it now may fall apart,0
"This would be a great scratching post, if it came with all the parts. I received this, minus the main screw that holds the two pieces together. So, the product is useless and I am returning. Amazon will replace without a problem, but quality control issues really annoy me.",0
Size by weight printed item did not match size printed in ad listing. Item was too small.,0
My dog was very depressed and anxious after her male buddy died. 5 drops in her water several times a day has really helped her. Even car rides got her upset without her pal. I continue to use it for now as she is improving. The loss of her companion really altered her life. Rescue rescued her! Great for any pet under stress for whatever reason.,1
"Like others have commented on this product, its not what it used to be.  I purchased this product for my Retriever last year and her chewing habits have not changed... the one I purchased last year lasted a good 3 months and the recent one I purchased barely lasted a week!!  I bought two thinking she would have something to chew for the next several months.  They say the size is anywhere from 7-10"" and both of the ones I recently bought were 7"" exactly.  Very disappointed.",0
My pups haaaated it but boy did I love it! Fit great. Beaux is about 90 lbs. we got the xxl and it fit well,1
Was 5 stars for obvious comfort and quality -- until our 10 week old puppy within a few minutes' time was able to open the seam between the outer shell fabric and the faux sheep's wool fabric lining the interior.  Sewing seam work on a dog's bed should not be so easy to separate.  With standard needle and thread I was able to hand repair the damage and create a more durable seam than what was apparently put in by a machine.,0
I have purchased  Frontline before from my veterinarian and had great success; however this package I received from this company did not help at all. My cats flea problem has only worsened which leaves me questioning the authenticity of this product. I will never buy from here again. I only gave one star because it would not let me delete and post.,0
"This bed is awesome. So thick and comfortable. Yes, I laid on it! :) My old dog loves it. I Cant say how it will stand up to time but seems like good quality, much better than others weve had.",1
"Looks adorable in my Boston Trrrier, good quality for the price! Highly recommend it!",1
Most of my fish died,0
Didnt last long,0
Great product for fighting fleas and ticks.,1
Awesome filtering system! Keep the aquariumbwater clear!,1
"The airpump set up didn't move much water through it and made alot of noise so I hooked it to a power head.  I had to drill some holes to allow a little extra overflow back into the tank.  For the money it works great,  I have a mangrove plant growing in it.",1
"I've used a number of types of trimmers over the years to for my dogs' nails, but these work better and more easily than any I've tried. I have two lab-mix dogs, one with semi-translucent nails and one with black nails. So far, I haven't nicked either!",1
Flimsy but the perfect size!,1
"I PURCHASED THIS BALL KNOWING THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL TENNIS BALLS USED IN THE PARK. MY DOGS LIKE THE EASY GRIP. THE BUMPS MAKE GRABBING ESP WHEN IN THE GRASS OR WET DIRT. JUST A SUPER COLOR. NOT THE USUAL YELLOW SEEN. BOUGHT 2 AT DIFFERNT TIMES, AS EXTRA. SWEEKY SOUND",1
"I bought this at the end of August, it worked well up until about a month. It sputtered a bit and stopped working after changing the filter (unplugging the fountain and then removing the filter). After fiddling with the center insert I got it to start flowing again. However, the same thing happened three days ago, unplugged the fountain to change the filter. After reassembling it, the water would not start flowing. I would like a replacement, or my money back to buy another brand of water fountain. I am very disappointed.

What I can say is that when it did work, it was perfect. The cats loved to drink from it, and the noise that it made was very relaxing.",0
Clicker doesn't stay down after 2 uses.,0
"Dont buy these kind of tanks online. I happened to have  gotten mine at wal-mart. Its in perfect condition. Your local pet store should have it. Yes i agree its cheap plastic. so be careful when you 1st wash it. I had to purchase new gravel and plants and a new fishy house for my betta which i have had over a month now. (he is still alive). i would recommend getting a heater for this tank. my fish would not come out of his fishy home for a couple of days till i put his heater in. of course he would come out and get air and maybe chill out. but he would hide in his home. after putting in the water heater that this tank recommends getting. He is swimming happily and normally. so my point is. that the water can get colder since its a bigger tank. i know it may sound weird but go ahead and test it out for yourself. Get the water conditioner they recommend also. works great i already had one of the choices. so it worked out fine. This tank however will not kill your fish. unless you have a really small fish. only cause the filter could suck the poor guy through and kill it that way. or its the un-treated water your using. Really many reasons. another flaw. it was kind of difficult to set up. but it wasn't all to bad. it is not a 24 hour filter run. so thats a plus so i could put my fish in right away  after set up.. over all i love the bubbles and color changing. and get this tank for a  betta fish. my betta is so happy with this one. so much better then his old 1 and 1/2 gallon one. so lets just go to pros and cons.

PROS: the motor for the filter is separate. So no 24 hour run. but at least run for an hour so it can make your tank clean and clear. And so you would know it does work. Colors are amazing. And space is great.

CONS: it makes an annoying air bubbling sound from the filter (but you get used to it). it was an annoying thing to set up but not to bad.

overall great product soo far once everything is settled.. :) hope this helps!",1
"""Busy"" Bone?  these are grossly overpriced for what they are.  My dog is ""busy"" for about 5 minutes and then it is gone.  When will anyone make something that a dog can really chew on.  As for smaller dogs, each one should be cut into at least 4 pieces.  what a rip off.",0
"My two spoiled rotten cats love these seats. By far, they are the best ones they ever had. Very, very well made and the cushion/mattress is awesome. They each have their own and they think they now rule the roost. I love my kitties.",1
does help with killing fleas and helps my dog stop biting and scratching.,1
"I ordered these for my dog and they just seem to get smaller and smaller. Better off with ""Best Bully Sticks""",0
My dog hates it. She sniffs it and walks away. Will go almost 2 days without eating.,0
It came in the mail  my dogs would not eat them and they love peanut butter,0
The perfect solution for big dogs.  Our 120lb Bernese started using this step immediately without hesitation.  It is very strong.  Super idea and product.,1
"I thought this was the Hana hut I had seen on birdcages4less.com. I wanted the green color so I bought this one instead. It is not the same cage, poor quality, and the bottom gate has a very large gap of 1"" between the side walls. My birds head could get stuck! Not as advertised. Find a better cage.",0
"Dog loves this ball, we place other things inside to give her some additional activity to do.  sometimes we use a tennis ball or treats and she loves chasing it.  bought the largest size and its perfect for a lab puppy.

Update - After a month our dog has been able to tear the ball, figured it to be a bit more durable, however i still would buy again, much rather have the dog chew on this and tear it up rather than the furniture, she does still love chasing this.",1
"If you have maine coons you know they are very special cats, I know I have had many different breeds and these are the best. This is the only food we feed them and the only kind they will eat. Enough said.",1
Got this crate for our 8week old puppy. She has been using it well since the day we brought her home ( a week ago) but today after leaving her in there for 3 hours while we went out to eat and to the store we came back to a huge hole chewed out of the front.  I am now very unimpressed.,0
Destroyed in two days!,0
"I made the mistake of not reading the reviews of this product. It would not retract. Had to take it apart to fix.  First time out it broke where the leash and cord connect. I fixed the cord to my old leash then the cord broke away from the reel. My dog is not aggressive,rescued him from a three and half year kennel stay. He sometime doesn't connect with the come command. That is why I bought this leash to help me in our training . The cord just broke away when it came to the end of the reel. It took us three hours to find our dog. The leash is now in the trash!",0
"This is a great bed. The people having lumps are putting it together wrong. The pad dosn't slide in length ways it goes in with all 3 pads going in at the same time, side to side.  Fits perfect.",1
"Nice item, great price.",1
I have a old dog and sometimes he wets the bed.when he wets his bed on this cover it beaded up and I used a paper towel to clean it up the cover was dry. I have a pillow bed for him but this cover works just fine he likes to fluff his bed. I wish I had this on all my furniture.,1
gave this a gift for xmas.,1
The hooks broke on the second day,0
"This specific rolls are not a part of the limited ingredient diet! Do not order if your dogs have allergies, especially to wheat.",0
My dogs love the joint jerky sticks but the bites are not good. Some pieces were so small a my dog could choke on them.,0
"It is VERY easy to install, however, this will NOT contain an agitated, chewer, or really a dog that is DETERMINED to get to the front.  I've installed it on a 2008 Buick Enclave behind the second row captain's chairs, which means it will fit Acadia, Traverse, and Outlooks.  It took a little manuvering to get the center/lower bungee to work the way i wanted but eventually i was happy with it.  The deluxe version included an extension that goes lower than the original, perfect for the captain's chairs, and plastic slip covers for the edges and center.  I didn't think i would use the plastic until i saw the top adjustable bracket makes contact with the window when fully extended and I wanted the buffer between steel and glass.  I have a shepherd and small 17# mix.  The lower extension (which connects with zipties) wasn't necessary for the big dog, but the little one could squeeze his way underneath without it.  More than anything I wanted something that wasn't going to mark up the roof of the car and this fit the bill.  Hardest part was really just adjusting the bungee's tightness.  As others have said, the adjustable sides slide rather easy, but can easily be remedied if you find it necessary with your dog.  I was thinking maybe some hockey tape on the extension but then if it needed to be adjusted for a different car it would be difficult to take off.  Overall I'm happy with its quality and price compared to the other options out there.",1
Fits a nice amount. Lid stays on well. I like how it's Semi transparent so I can see when I'm running low.,1
Great found my dog wasn't what we was told it was. Got results in time frame they gave,1
"Average.  Lumens are not that great.  White color is yellowish.  Blue is not high frequency.

Beware that the remotes on all Current USA LED strips affect every single other device...saltwater Orbit remote affects this freshwater led.  If you have multiple setups, this is a disaster!  This will work for a single tank only.",0
Do not like this at all. It leaves a grimy feel and I don't like the smell either. Wish I had returned it.,0
"Fits in the collar like the invisible fence batter caps,  though I feel they have a shorter life span than the name brand.  Still worth the price.",1
"This is the second one I've bought and they're great; however, I ordered a brown one and received a white one. I returned it and ordered another brown one. Again, I received another white one. I kept it and spray painted it. Not impressed with the service but the product is great!",1
Dog tore it apart days after receiving. Pale pink pig held up (and is still holding up).,0
Not much to say.  My dogs and cats love it.  Haven't heard any complaints from them yet.,1
This item quickly fell apart.,0
"Not for dogs that chew, stuffing was everywhere with a few minutes.",0
Very small. My tiny Chihuahua didn't fit,0
"I think I was shipped a watered down product, it has a very light scent in the bottle but just smells like wet dog on my dog. The vanilla Earthbath spray smells SO GOOD - I don't know why this one sucks. But it sure does! Warning - you can't return it because it is classified as a ""hazardous material"" - waste of money :(",0
4 weeks now and cat won't use it yet.,0
"Not worth it.  Lasted about six months, then fell over and broke in half.",0
"This shipment came in on time and the product was as expected.  Our two dachshunds love these things, so I give each dog a snack at night when I put them to bed.  The literally jump in their beds waiting for the treat.",0
Works great!,1
"I've not tasted this myself, but Shadow loves it--poor dog (a doberman) is allergic to so many things and this food is something he can not only digest, but love!",1
My 80 pound dog loved it!,1
I am updating my review as this product has not been working at all. We have fleas to in our home. I'm now have to hire an exterminator. Frontline has been a big disappointment. It isn't good any longer.,0
"Will have to throw away and go back to grass patches.. Maybe it's just my dog, but I must agree with a lot of the other negative reviews that mention this is not for puppies.  I mistakenly assumed the grass layer attaches to the bottom two trays but was wrong - since it just lays on top, my puppy immediately started digging at it (as if it were real grass) and then when the turf instantly came up, it was in his mouth and he was tearing it up like a toy, and definitely didn't use it to pee as with the grass patch we were buying.. I think the manufacturer should take potty training for puppies out of the description, or find a way to easily attach the turf to the unit as needed so it becomes more solid",0
"FOR 2ND CUT HAY, THE TEXTURE IS RATHER STEMY. THE HAY DOES HAVE ABUNDANT SEED HEADS, WHICH IS NICE. MY TWO GUINEA PIGS REQUIRE A SOFTER TEXTURE, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE. NOT SO.",0

"My puppy  loves a few licks for a reward.  It saves the  calories  of constant  treats. Only thing is that her tongue  is not strong  enough  to  move  the  roller,  so I  give  it  a  little  squeeze.",1
These we about as bad as discount brands. Pads leak. There are better brands at the pet store.,0
"I like these heaters! I've have several, one in every tank. They are easy to set up and adjust. I like to get a size bigger than needed just so it doesn't have to work as hard but, I've never had a problem with one.",1
Like the light when its bright but it dims out after a short time. Lucky its only on a 5gal tank or would totally suck.,0
Takes up little space and helps organize the cat food for FIFO!,1
"I have 2 cats, and I had originally bought this to go along with a cat tent to lead them to...but the pieces don't really match up right to the tent. Nevertheless, the cats are OBSESSED with playing in this thing, indoors especially! They aren't used to the outside, but I figure if I can get them used to it being around and them playing in it inside, they will eventually feel comfortable enough to go outside with it! I leave one side zipped up, and they take turns sitting all the way in the tunnel against the zipped up end. It's hilarious! Who knew?! Thanks for the quick shipping too!",1
I bought this for my 14 year old cat who's very food motivated figured this would help get her playing when it got here it was way too big even for her and she's kind of a big cat,0
Its doesnt work,0
Service dog lettering came off after first use.  Pretty cheaply made patch.,0
Love watching our dogs enjoying eating this and knowing it's good for them.,1
Post not wrapped in roping.  Did not meet my needs.,0
Sizing off ours was way too small ad very difficult to get over puppy's head. Matching leash broke withing 4 days of usage (with a 3 lb puppy).,0
"My cat, Fox Mulder approves of this product. He uses it daily, albeit he sits top to bottom while scratching, but who am I to correct a cat? This product needs to be against a wall.",1
Handy to carry around on the leash when I take my dog for exercise time! Small kit but plenty to bandage larger dog up if needed to.,1
"The pump on this sprayer is not so good at all. It leaks, and when I tried to fix it, it got worse. The company needs to get a better pump for this product. I didn't have fleas in the house, just sprayed stink bug entry ways around windows. I haven't seen any since.",0
Product collapsed after a few uses by my dog _,0
"Reading some of the negative reviews makes me wonder about the remarks on outdoor use. Really? You keep your dog outside. That is just wrong.
This is a indoor playhouse, fortress. I bought the Pet Gear Ramp 28 x 16 x 16 size and left the stair off. It is perfect height for my front window and my dogs live up there and love it.

"I had purchased these treats that my Italian Greyhound fell in love with at our Vets office. The first order arrived, and was fresh and perfect. Then I placed this order, expecting the same quality as previous orders. I was sadly disappointed. The treats arrived on my door step. I opened them up. I tried to break one in half to stuff a pill in for my dog, and it crumbled into pieces. The bag of treats seem old or not fresh, like they should be. I feel ripped off and will never buy these again online. :-(",0
"This particular size Cosequin is suitable for cats, Of the seven cats of mine that have used this product it made a significant difference in six. Two of them were dragging their poor old butts around so badly we thought that they were ready for the final solution, but dosing with this product turned them around within days and all of them went at least another 2 years with no further visible sign of joint problems.

Further, my sister is now dosing her 17-year old with it and he turned around in the typical time period and started acting like he had not in several years.

You can pop the caps and mix the product with their wet food or as I do, just grab the little buggers and ram it down their throats. Either way, it's effective. If you love your pet, give this a try. It's actually cheaper than clinical euthanasia!",1
"The puppies love these beds. Easy to unzip the covers and wash, put back on. Like the waterproofing on the pillow.",1
"I was skeptical about how well this would work, but once I tried it, I was really impressed! We have a furminator we use too but it is crazy how well the zroom brush gets the hair out. It's like a magnet for dog hair! From now on I'll be using both this & the furminator and hopefully that will cut down on all the dog hair around the house!",1
"He likes bright shiny things, this toy was a bust and is just gathering dust on a shelf. After a week our bird was still playing keep-away so we removed it from his cage and replaced it with a string of mirrors. He was happy!",0
This is made of the thinnest material and there were holes and tears in it by the end of the first day. Total piece of junk! I wouldn't even give this one star. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,0
"If this Kitty Bed DID actually heat up, it was so slight  that it made no difference at all.  I can't even say it puts out ANY heat.",0
My cat loves her new cat condo. It was easy to put together. The only thing I can complain about is the design. All of the levels are the same size so it's hard for my cat to get to the top. She has to get a running start and scale the side to get up.,1
"I used this to protect my car while walking dogs. I have had at least 15 different dogs in my car of all sizes. This protected my seats and floor from mud, fur, and scratches.",1
My Golden just loves these. They are a little crunchy & she loves the taste. No artificial ingredients. She loves them so much that she will carry it in her mouth & run up & down the hallway with it because she is so excited to have it.,1
"We've gone though three of these for our Leo. We've tried different locations in the tank and all eventually cracked; the first one only lasted two days. They're nice looking and he enjoyed it as a hide but what's the point in a moist hide if it has to be all the way to the cool side of the tank?

Ordered the Exo Terra instead and it has held up much better. Not quite as deep but works very well.",0
basically lots of money for two sided tape. very difficult to apply and ended up ruining tow of the sheet.,0
"Worst purchase I've ever made.  Terribly unsafe design unless you're riding only on straight and level terrain.  It arrived with a wheel axle poking through the mesh.  A call to the seller resulted in a complete refund, so I cannot fault the seller.  My family and I spent several days training the dog to go into the trailer.  The first few miles of the maiden voyage on a paved bike trail went just fine until the trail dipped down to go under a bridge.  Pooch was apparently sitting up in the trailer, making it top-heavy.  The trail was slightly descending and turning left, and the trailer flipped over, wrenching the bike over.  I ended up with a trip to the ER and $10,000 in dental bills so far from two dead teeth that had to be extracted and replaced.",0
"This item was delivered with the ribbon cut and hang by a tread, luckily I was towards the end and it was easy to repair. I chose to repair rather than return, otherwise Im happy with the leash now that it is fixed.",0
"Hate it and therefore, do not use it.  The teeth on this are too short for medium/longer furred dogs.  Doesn't even work well for cats.  Had hoped it would work well with all the great reviews, but for my 20 canines and felines, this is not the one.",0
"i am using these for a 7 year old doxie who was abused when she was little. now she piddles when excited, anxious, or scolded. time to protect the bed, carpet and other things. medium is good for a ""tweenie"" doxie who's waist measurement is 17""",1

I bought this basking light for my girlfriends iguana and with in a day it blew up almost injuring her iguana and lighting her house on fire.,0
"Ridiculous product.  I feel completely duped and they can't be returned!  No way will my dog put these on his feet and they wouldn't work on snow and ice anyway.  It's a complete waste of money.  I bought them because Amazon said they were ""best sellers.""  Probably because they can't be returned.  I should have investigated the return policy before buying.  Very disappointed.",0
"Horrible quality, was so cheap we ended up throwing it away. Would not stay up and screws did not keep rods together.",0
Ok the packaging and shipping deserved 5 Stars.  The problem I have with the lamp is it doesn't put out much heat.  There is some but not enough.  It's great that it gives my bearded dragon the UVA/UVB light that it needs but my bearded dragon doesn't seem to enjoy basking in it.  I figured a 100 Watt bulb would be a great heat source for my 40 gallon breeder tank but it's definitely not enough.  I've had to add another 100 watt basking light too to make sure the tank temperature is where it needs to be and my bearded dragon prefers to stay on the other side of the tank with the other basking ligh rather then this one. Honestly feels like a waste of money at this point.  The thinner UVA/UVB light strips would have been better then this huge but bulb at this point,0
dog loves it,1
This shampoo has an overpowering smell that just masks the smell of the yeast infection.  It did not help my dog.  I have wrote the company about the guarantee but have not received a response.,0
Did not work for my dog.,0
My great dane will chase this ball over and over.  She loves it!,1
My pit bull mix did chew on it when he was bored and he was able to chew the edges off no problem. I made him feel guilty by shaming him and now he doesn't play with it unless someone else shows an interest in it.,1
"I ordered this for each family member who had dogs - a total of 5 of them. I have 2 dogs that shed like crazy. I was so hoping that this would work. Maybe it would if you used it for a long time before pulling the hairs off the glove. It just doesn't pull enough hairs to take off like the commercial shows, even after 3 uses for a Beagle and Chihuahua that each sheds like crazy. I can say that my dogs love being rubbed by the glove. But they love any petting. I was disappointed to see that the glove did not pick up all stray hairs. Mostly, hairs just accumulates at the end of the dog's body. I can't recommend this product and wish I had purchased something else. Get a back scratcher. Cheaper and more liked by the dogs.",0
"This stuff works great for little 14 pounder. Would recommend it to anyone. We take him out to preserves where there are plenty of ticks, fleas and biting flies. Never had an issue and when there was a tick, it had croaked and fell right off. Our dog has very short hair and is small. I cannot review for longer haired or larger dogs.",1
I gave this fours stars only because it doesn't work for all dogs.  I have an 80lb Boxer/Mastiff mix that this didn't hold back at all.  If you have a smaller sized dog I'm sure this would work just fine.  It attaches easily and should work great for dogs up to 45 pounds-ish.,1
"We have two other treat balls that work great but are solid and you can hear but not see the treats inside. Wife bought this treat ball because it has a clear half to see the inside. This ball does not work well in that the half without the hole is heavier than the half with the hole. Therefore, when the ball is rolled the half with the hole rarely reaches turns downward to drop/release the treats. Our dog gets frustrated and attempts to chew the ball instead of rolling it to get to the food. I don't recommend this ball unless your dog is on a diet and toothless.",0
Pet bags that don't break easily and come packaged in 1000 at a great price! Plus they are pink,1
Has made a huge POSITIVE difference in the wellness and coat of our senior cats.,1
"This ball was yet another waste of money. It is supposed to be durable, but my dog had it destroyed within 10 minutes. I have an English Bulldog and I was so excited about getting this ball for her because I am always looking for indestructible toys, but she had it punctured within 60 seconds and was tearing pieces off of it within 10 minutes. Of course, I didn't keep the receipt so it is just another toy that has gotten thrown away. Definitely a waste of $20. They have a web site address on the ball, but the web site is worthless as there is no contact information or really any information at all.",0
The plastic piece used to hold the collared leash broke on one side. Now the device hangs off the leash which defeats the purpose..,0
"Sigh. Wish I could give more stars, the product looks solid, good quality. True to size and just what I wanted. Unfortunately my dogs will NOT touch it. They are big chewers, a Bernese mountain dog and a golden retriever. But for some reason they HATE this bone. I wish they wouldnt because bully sticks are so expensive and don't last longer than 5 minutes. Ill try elk antlers next.",0
This doesn't work.,0
"This harness is adjustable, but I have a large dog whose very leash reactive and after a few tugs it easily becomes totally loose. The connections feel cheap, and I worry they will not hold. I plan on cutting off the nervous and turning them into badges for his existing easy walk harness. This was definitely not the quality I expected, but it does match the description/images.",0
Well made leash and is fully adjustable for comfort!,1
"sure does the job. perfect for not getting your hands dirty, the pan holds a decent amount of poop before needing to empty",1
"Stopped working after a month. Did not keep the water clean. Wish I could get my money back, but it's too late to request a refund.",0
Looks very flimsy!,0
This collar kept shocking my dog even when I wasn't holding the remote.,0
Didn't work on our 2 girls.,0
This product is the same as what I got from the vet but a lot cheaper.  It was delivered quickly.  I'm happy!,1
My cat loves this thing. It's his cuddle buddy now.,1
This particular item got stuck on our little girls head and she could not get it off. She started crying and struggling to get it off and finally through much tears on all of our parts we had to lcut it off last night. It is not made correctly around the neck. By larger or don't  Buy it at all.,0
My cat would not eat this stuff... she's very finicky.  I gave the rest of it to my local shelter for their cats.,0
I have purchased many of these filters because I have 3 mini-bow aquariums. Amazon seems to have the best prices for these filter cartridges.,1
My little guy loves them,1
I really like this. It smells great and it does keep fleas off the dogs.,1
I'm sorry to report that my dogs were rubbed raw on their legs by this ill fitting harness. We tried it on our toy poodle and it caused terrible chaffing on her inner leg. My standard doxie has a pretty severe abrasion from it as well. I tried it on my mini doxie and within minutes it was already starting a raw spot on her leg. Can't return them since I didn't keep the packaging. Really bummed.,0
Item as described but whe i reciebd them one of the 2 boxes busted open. Product itself seems to be working great,1
Dasuquin was recommended by the vet for my 14 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. This product helps her get up and moving so much easier! I recommend this product for anyone looking for an arthritis medicine for their canine!,1
"This mat does exactly what it says, it holds the litter so its not scattered on our wood floors. I'm very happy with the performance of this mat as compared to our old ones.",1
Didn't work for my pomchi. He is allergic to the soy. Had I known there was soy I would not have purchased. I don't buy soy products. But now I know he is allergic to soy. Took about a week to figure this out due to his itching really bad.,0
"Love these! Not a big mess at all once my dog tears them apart! Can't wait to give these to her on christmas! Great price :)

PS yes I give my dog presents! She gets all hyped up when everyone else is unwrapping presents, so it's nice for her to have something to get excited about too :)",1
"This review is for ASIN:B00K5N7UA0 Dallas Manufacturing Co. Products Fleece Pet Bed, Brown Plaid, 36 by 45-Inch.

This Dallas Manufacturing Co fleece pet bed is a good bed with a few caveats.  First of all 36-Inch by 45-Inch is the size of the cover when it is flat with nothing in it.  This sides are not box cut, so some inches are lost upon stuffing.  With the stuffing in there as sold by Brinkman Pet Products, it measures more like 32 inches by 42 inches.  The cover comes off for easy washing.  The interior cushioning is inside an interior zippered case so that you can add or remove to get the stuffing level you like.  The stuffing is Eco-first recycled fiber fill.  When my 100 pound puppy or I sit on it, we go straight to sitting on the floor with fluffy cushion all around us.  The material is soft on both sides.  This pet bed is attractive and comfortable with either side up.  The fabric on both sides is thicker and heavier weight than many other pet beds so it might hold up better to biters.  Both of my dogs do love this pet bed and I have uploaded photos of my 100 pound Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy for you to see how he looks on the 36 x 45 inch(more like 32 x 42) bed.",1
got really sick of this after half way thru,0
didn't work.,0
"My cats loves this and if they had their way, they would play with it all day.  However, my attention span is less than theirs so we play with it fitfully during the day.  Surprisingly this simple toy is durable and easy to attach other things to which the cats also love, but the little mouse is a favorite as is the attachment with feathers by daBird, I think, that my thirteen year old cat gets youthful with.  Before I had this, my cats loved to play with laser toys, but it is mentioned that they can blind a cat. This toy provides hours of pleasure and is well worth the minimal investment.",1
"Animal Planet nails it again.  That TV station is great and so it this product.  I was a bit unsure if it was too big for my car, which is a Mini Cooper.  However, it fit perfectly.  Ease of installing it in your car takes about 30 seconds.  So easy.  You just loop it around the headrests and bam you're finished.  My dog, Bella, likes it.  I take her to a lot more places because of it.  I never knew how much dirt she was leaving in my car until we started using this.  Uninstalling it is just as easy to install it.  All the dirt Bella leaves on the cover is easy to trash.  You just take it out and shake it.  As far as durability, it is amazing.  Bella is a large dog making it easy to scratch my seats.  But with this on, it protects my seats.  There is a zipper in the middle that keeps her from jumping up front.  It's easy to zip when driving too.  The only bad thing about it is Bella's head can unzip it very easily.  Maybe velcro would work better.  But it's no biggie, she still doesn't jump up front.  All in all, this is a great product.  I almost bought an expensive cover as I was afraid the price for this one may not work as well.  I certainly was wrong.  It's a great price and works perfectly.",1
Only had for a couple months and already peeling,0
Got torn up with no problem by my dog.,0
"Out of the 3 cats in the house, only one would eat these. That said, it lasted a while and she just finished the bottle. I'll probably look for a different multivitamin that all the cats like.",1
cats hated it,0
perfect for our little morkie!,1
"I ordered the black bags before and was very happy with them.  I decided to go for blue for a change and have regretted it.

The bags arrived thrown together in a large bag (that was not sealed) as opposed to the nice box that the black bags came in. In addition, they do NOT separate easily - I have to look careful to see the approximation of a perforation and have to really tug hard to rip them apart.  The black bags came apart far more easily.  Finally the bags become quite transparent when you have the expected contents - was not expecting this...",0
not a real big fan of this brush. ..my $5 walmart brush works a lot better...the brushing surface is very small. ...And I'm not a big fan of the sharp bristles....and my cat's face. monkey and meow will back me up on that one,0
"It is little more than a cover for dog odors. It may work on skunk odor.  My dog rolls in dead fish and the Skunk off covered the fish oder.  However, the odor of the skunk off was very strong and I had to use soap to remove both the fish odor and the odor of the skunk off.  I will just use soap and wash the dog and forget using the skunk off. (there use to be a product that I thought was called skunk off.  It was an enzyme and really worked on all dog oders)",0
Must have for any tank. I haven't had to use my glass scraper since purchasing this.,1
"I own a long hair cat and wow, I can not believe he hair this furminator removed.  I strongly recommend this for long hair cats. You can comb out any knots or hair mats",1
this product description said Large. it is not large my maltipoo just barely fits in it very disappointed,0
Great Product. Highly recommend!,1
Super perfect. Love how strong it is and how it looks. I can tell my dog is comfortable. Will be buying another one soon for another dog.,1
Pacman frog was not a fan.,0
Great product and I like be that a portion goes towards animal rescue.,1
This is just great.  Instead of being a hard case that you carry via the handle and your pet gets sloshed back and forth and really does not like it.  you get to sling this over your shoulder and cradle the side and thus your cat so that he/she feels comfortable being carried.  I cannot speak more highly about how much I love this carrier.  It also straps in much better with my cars seatbelts so my cat feels more safe in the car.,1
The lowest level was extremely painful. I wouldn't put it on my dogs.,0
"I can't stand litter boxes and I've tried them all. I finally decided to give the Genie a whirl and have loved it so far. I have it a on the 'Cat' setting so it washes right after a cat has used it. I do not have litter box smell in my house at all. Love that.

But, I got my first whiff of the 'baked poo' smell this morning when the arm missed a tiny bit of waste. Wow, incredibly intense.  So I scooped the little bits left and hit the wash cycle again. All is well with the world.

I have had no real issues with the cat genie so far besides that which only lasted a short while (open windows!) and it's still a vast improvement over the constant litter box smell you get with most boxes. And the washable granules are much easier to clean up than regular litter. I have a small rug in front of the box so most of the granules end up there. I just pick up the rug and pour the granules back in the Genie. Done deal.

Overall a much cleaner and easier litterbox than any I've tried.",1
Litter scoop seems fine. I have no idea why the company would use a label that is impossible to get off the scoop. They put it over the part you have to use and then use and adhesive like super glue. Not happy abou the time it is going to take to get this label off. Its a litter scoop! The label challenges gives this a 1 Star in my book.,0
"Unless you have  teeny tiny dog don't order. Even though I followed the measurements and ordered based on that, still didn't fit.",0
All good,1
"My dog loved this christmas present! Every single square has a squeaker, the tail rattles, and the head is stuffed.
If she had teeth..i'm sure this would be destroyed in a day. Since she doesn't, this will provide months of fun!",1
"I have struggled with purchasing ""odor-free"" bully sticks on Amazon.  The first was a braided bully stick that was supposedly odor free, yet when I opened the envelope the stench nearly knocked me over.  That one was returned.  This one was my second order, and I purchased it because most  of the reviews said it was odor free.  NOT SO!  I cut it up into thirds to give to my tiny pooch and she sat next to me, chewing away happily...But I was nearly gagging from the smell.  Seriously it smelled like a pile of manure.  NOT a subtle scent at all!!!  I was forced to go around the corner and buy some extremely overpriced chewies for my pup for a trip tonight.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR HOME TO SMELL LIKE A BARN!  I will not be purchasing any more bully sticks online!!!",0
"I was happy at first despite the 36"" hood to 24"" light. Then it just stopped working. I would suggest avoiding this product.",0
The bulb only lasted 1 week. I gave it 1 star because 0 isn't an option.,0
worst brush ever. bristles were too short to even comb through my poodle's long hair on ears. waste of $,0
It was good while it lasted but that was about 4 days...My cavalier king charles pup got right through it and she's not an aggressive chewer by any means.,0
"These are the worst male diapers I have used. As soon as he pers in them, he needs a bath because the padding is not absorbent. Not only does he get wet around his private parts, but he also gets wet all the way around his belly where ever the band touches  and is immediately smelly.  I would definitely rather have the puddles on my tile then be required to be at him every time he has an accident.  Also, the Velcro is not the quality of other diapers I have used on him, and doesn't stick nearly as well.  They did fit my 8- pound Maltese  Pomeranian  well, and the colors are cute.",0
I love the steps --sure saves my back from lifting my dog onto my bed. took me a few days to train him to walk up the steps but with treats he soon learned. Thanks !!,1
"so soft they were mostly crumbs,  the texture of pie-dough.  my dog likes soft but no this soft.  am considering rolling them up together into marble-sized treats, the clay/doughy texture would make it easy.  2 stars because he did eventually eat the crumbs in his snack dish.",0
Great,1
My kitten is having a blast with this toy scratcher. Is exactly like the picture and is even bigger on my point of view. Very happy.,1
"It says ""lavender-scented, and they really mean it. As potent as walking through a department-store perfume counter. Way too much for me to take.",0
Doesn't work even after a year .... would have gave it zero stars if possible ... tried it every way everyone suggested with no success ... have a very smart cat I guess to smart to be coaxed into using this.,0
"We put this near our couches our cats use to stretch on and covered in cat nip. Cats love to use it to stretch, saving what's left of the corners of our couch. We even put treats on top of it near the edge to encourage them to scratch up top to try to knock them down for enrichment.",1
"Sincerely,
A Pissed off FL Rottweiler",0
So happy we got this. Our puppy is learning fetch and he loves the lights and can even find it in the snow.,1
"I was disappointed to find that despite no indication in the product description this is a stuffing-less toy. Not sure if this is a mistake, as another version of the toy I purchased is fulmy stuffed, but regardless it is not the quality I was hoping for and my dog is completely uninterested in it as a result.
Oh, it it does not ""grunt"" as the description states. It has a regular, run of the mill squeaker.",0
Dog loves these,1
This is great. it is much more than I expected.,1
I thought this item was very neat. I guess it would work for a small dog with not much strength. My Retriever/Boxer pulls and it caused the leash to no longer retract. If you drop the leash the cap pops open and your batteries will fall out for the flash light.,0
"I do not recommend this product - the motor/impeller melted down within a month of use, even though I kept the water level proper and filter clean.",0
Works great! My dogs does not have stinky breathe after couple of days :),1
"I live with British shorthairs and she loves with play with the wand.
It has 2 more extra feathers and all of them look luxury.
the wand is long, solid, also flexable so you canplay with your cat happyly and easily.",1
"Any time we take our dog anywhere a dozen people ask what breed of dog he is. We wanted to be able to say something other than ""A rescue mutt, we don't know"" so my wife purchased this DNA test. The packaging and swab return was straightforward, but the DNA test took a bit longer than estimated to return. The most disappointing part was that after all that waiting most of the DNA test was inconclusive. It showed that our dog is 1/4 Beagle and 1/8 Pomeranian, but that's it! The rest of the results were inconclusive and showed at least six different categories of dog that were possibilities, with a dozen dog breeds in each category. While we wouldn't have been disappointed with some inconclusive results, the fact that over 60% of our dog's makeup was unaccounted for made this a bit of a waste. People still ask us what breed of dog he is, and we still have no answer.",0
I have an 11lb puppy and she already started eating this after 5 mins. It's very flexible and I thought it would be made of a harder plastic than rubber... like a regular frisbee. Definitely not as durable as her Kong and Kong bone.,0
Don't stay on,0
Dog hated it and could push himself out.,0
Stands up to our APBT,1
"Neither one of my cats would eat these. I mixed it in wet food, dry food, tried putting it into the tiniest pieces and no matter what I did they could smell it and would not eat it. I have heard great things from other people but they didn't work for my cats.",0
"I ordered this for my 8 pound dog as shown in small... But they sent extra large, I then requested a return order and I ordered another costume in small as shown so as to have it by Halloween.  They still haven't responded to any of my several attempts to contact them and to add to the insult the second costume arrived today and is in extra large as well.  I now have Amazon trying to resolve it and may have to get my credit card company involved as well.  This is truly a SCAM company and I now believe they sent the wrong merchandise knowing it was wrong just to make the sale.  I wish I would have read the other reviews before I ordered this.",0
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this playpen! I use it for foster kittens, and they can play as much as they want without the resident cats getting in there with them. It's the perfect amount of space, too. I love that is has the carrying case and the ground stakes so kitties can play outside as well!",1
GOOD,1
thx,1
"The padding too soft and sinks down too far.  We put ours on a tile floor and the dog sinks right down to where it's not very soft for him and he can feel the hardness of the tile.  It might be OK if it was on carpet.  We put a pillow in it which has helped,",0
This car seat protector does not work with a middle seat belt and its too big for a Chevy Sonic! Other then that it is well made.,0
"Fairly well made, great price But the best part is the added safety it adds for both me and my dog when walking him in the evenings..  Or even in the dog park - he stands right out!

It is washable, the light has gotten dimmer since I bought it though.  I would order several next time to have ""on hand"" for when they need to be replaced (at $7 that's about what I would expect).  Light and battery pack comes out making collar washable.",1
Ive ordered this collar two times but each time the buckle snapped after only about one month of use. So sad because it is beautiful leather.,0
"Very sturdy, just would like it to be a little larger, quite small but works well with our little guy!",1
"I have used topical flea treatments on my dogs and cats in the past, however, this time, the Frontline burned BOTH of my cats' skin where it was applied. It left scabs and bald patches. I will be skeptical to use any topical treatment in the future, not just Frontline.",0
"the food was very dry, made me wonder if they are storing it properly...",0
Works great in our 30 gallon aquarium.,1
I ordered two tidy cats breeze boxes - the upper portion of one of the boxes was broken. A small section was broken out showing that the package had been struck in that area.,0
"We purchased this lamp to keep our hedgehog warm, and it lasted less than a month. After a few days of procrastination, we just went to look for the receipt, and low and behold! We are ONE DAY beyond the return window.

If a $40 heat lamp were to last even six months, I'd consider it reasonable (though far from a good value). This thing is junk, and apparently *known* to be junk, as evidenced by the return policy of one month.

Too bad. If it worked for a conscionable length of time, it would be a good solution for a lot of pet owners. But try to find something else. This thing is a waste of money.",0
I wish you could post pictures here because I have one of my cat sitting in the middle of with pieces of it all around him.  He tore it up within the first hour!  It's not sturdily built and the different layers have no way of being held down.  Not well made.  Do not recommend.,0
Didn't last as long as I thought. My english bulldog only had this laying around the house for a few days among other toys. After about 20 minutes of solid chewing tonight he suddenly stopped and I see blood on the bone. I know he's an aggressive chewer but I thought this would last longer and not cut his gums. He's had several other Nylabones and never had this problem. Won't be buying this one again,0
The collar went off at every movement and ambient sounds. It was vibrating for no reason no matter how it was adjusted .,0
"Not much of a puzzle to keep the dog's mind active.  30 seconds, I'm not even out the door and the contents are gone.",0
"My dogs love it! I have 2 golden retrievers and they play tug of war with this bone, until now it is holding it together very well. I love KONG products.",1
"The quality of this toy is very good. Unfortunately for my blue front Amazon, he has too much trouble getting the peanuts  out so he lost interest pretty quickly.",0
Do not buy trying to install it broke easily and its very fragile. Not worth it.,0
"Helped my kitten grow and was gentle to his stomach, but he clearly did not like the taste or smell and would only get to it as a last resort.",0
I'm only giving this a one star because it's such a rip off. THESE ARE AT SMITH'S FOR 3.99$. My kitten loves them. They are his favorite treat! But seriously 12 dollars for three tiny little milks? Uh no....SMITHS IS A WAY BETTER PRICE! you'll get 4 times as many there.,0
"This dog collar doesn't illuminate through the entire collar. Only half of the collar is lite. When my dog turns in the other direction, I cannot see the collar lite at all. I would not recommend this one.",0
This are large and sturdy.  They are not flimsy.  The blades are tight and sharp.  I love it.  Highly recommend.,1
It took forever to get it in the mail and by the time I did get it I had to take my dog to the vet and get a prescription for his ears.,0
"It does a great job skimming across the water, so that's pretty fun.  It is very visible on surface of water, so it is easy for my dog to see.  I also like the idea of my dog retrieving a frisbee from the water as he can have his mouth mostly closed which limits the amount of water he gets in his mouth and swallows.  This is important for me, as he oftens swims in salt water which is not good for dogs to ingest, causing diarrhea and mild salt water poisoning.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that when I throw it like a frisbee on land, it always turn sideways, only going a short distance before it hits the ground and rolls.  But it works well if throwing it low over the water, which is what it is meant for.",1
I had one of these and (1) I had the same problem with the sides caving in because no air got back into the bottle unless I took the top off; and (2) The bottle only lasted a couple weeks before the trigger completely broke and it was utterly useless.  NOT a good buy!,0
"This is bedding ripped up from the wild, home to water snakes & amphibians. Coconut coir must be used instead.",0
"Dog still hates having it on, but she can wear it in her crate and sleep comfortably.",1
"I ordered two of these for my dogs. One was as expected. The other was not even close to the dimensions specified. My dogs got through it in a day. I have a Boston Terrier mix and a pit mix who generally they take months to get through an antler. This was a waste of money. I have purchased other Barkworthies antlers and those reviews cite inaccurate sizing. This is the first time I have experienced that, but I will be more likely to look at other brands going forward.",0
It smells like an orange dream. My doggies smell good for a hole week,1
"Love this product. I have 4 dogs who are raw fed and this helps make sure they aren't missing anything they may need. They all love the taste of it, so no issues feeding over the top of their food, very large container with a scoop makes for easy dishing out, although the recommended amounts seem to be on the heafty side with the amount it takes so we it down. Has helped my Great dane with sensitive stomach issues.
Only down fall to me has a fishy type oder when it gets wet (IE: when they eat)",1
This is one of my dogs favorite treats to get. They look forward to getting this every night. Always happy when I am able to find these at a good price from amazon!!!,1
"Great ingredients, but none of my cats will touch them. I don't have picky cats either. I gave them to my boyfriend, one of his cats likes them so at least they won't get wasted.",0
The dogs love them!!,1
Our four legged babies love this stuff! Highly recommend,1
"So this was the first litter I used that was flush able, so at first I thought it was great. My cat really liked it too, and I think it is because cats prefer a sandy litter, and this one is pretty fine grain. However after a while I started feeling sick to my stomach when I would have to go and scoop out the pee spots from the box. This litter for some reason brings out the strong ammonia smell of cat urine, and I believe it is because it does not allow for the urine to completely dry. Instead it forms gooey clumps that are partially wet, and fall apart when transporting to the bathroom toilet. I would have to scrap the bottom of the box and try to find as many of the urinated parts as I could because the smell was just too potent. I ended up using Worlds Best and never wanted to look back (it is truly the best litter out there). However one of my cats did not like Worlds Best, and pooped outside of the box in protest, and  so I had to end up eventually doing a crazy mixture of Worlds Best  and Blue B. litter. I insist on having some of the Worlds Best mixed in because even having a little bit helps so much with the cat urine smell/clumping it all neatly together! If your cat uses Worlds Best, do not bother looking into Swheat, I cannot fathom why anyone would prefer this one and pay a similar price for it. Worlds Best is worth the money. I only wish my cat liked it enough so that I could use it by itself, but it is not sandy enough and thus I resort to doing a mixture... yet nothing is so bad that I have ever gone back to buying Shweat.",0
"So I just got this today and put it on my saddle. Pretty disappointed in the size that it actually is.  In the picture they make it seem like you're going to have some over hang but not on my saddle.  They must be using a kid saddle for this photo.  Not only that, but it's basically just some fabric cut into a saddle shape.  I could have done better just putting a tarp over it.  I guess I (wrongly) assumed that the parts for the stirrup would cover all the way around but they don't, they just lay over the outside, and just barely that.  I guess I'm stuck with it though.  Probably won't protect my saddle from dust but at least if it gets wet somewhere in the seat area it will probably be protected.  Guess I'll have to invest in a tarp.",0
Wish they made a bigger bag in this item but my cats love it.,1
Gave me snails,0
"My 2 bunnies love the hay from Small Pet Select. I usually get the 2nd cut hay. It is fresh and green in color. It has a nice light green tea like smell. I usually get the 20lb box but if you have room for the 60lb box that is the best value. I bought the 60lb box once but I find the box is too big to store in my apartment. Although the 60lb box has a lot of hay and last my bunnies for about 3 months, the hay stayed fresh all those months.",1
Not all have squeakers in them. Shred pretty easy.,0
Guinea pig would get trapped behind.. Hooks don't secure well... Waste of money... I don't recommend!,0
My dog wants to bite the rubber instead of trying to get whatever is inside out.,0
The portion that holds the battery broke off rather quickly.  The light is rather dim and hard to see.  You are better off buying a light that hangs from the collar.,0
"This thing is life changing, collects at least 10 times the hair I normally get with brushing!",1
"I had looked at Petco and the same size 36"" crate with 2 doors was over $100. I'm really glad I waited and looked on Amazon before buying. I ended up getting 2 of these for different rooms, and 2 pads for the bottom, and they work excellent. It also comes with a divider and detachable handle for carrying. Good quality for the cost and I'm sure they will last for many years to come.",1
"The cat's seem to love it, which was surprising. It's fairly easy to clean. My one complaint is the charcoal filters ""settle"" and impede the flow from the pump. You can take them out and shake them, but they settle again pretty quickly.  I've just removed it and use the pre-pump- filter, which seems to do a good job of keeping stuff out.  I clean it every 3 or 4 days, but it doesn't even look like it needs it at that point (none of the scum buildup you get on plastic fountains).  It does seem a bit fragile, but I'm careful when I clean.",1
"When I got my dog, she was eating Beneful and I wanted to switch her off of it immediately.  I tried a few different types of food and then I saw Rachael Ray and the good price point and I thought it would be perfect. Well I started mixing it in with her old food and she saw it was new, tried it and spit it out.  Like she literally spit it out on the floor and looked at me like why would you give this to me?  I tried day after day with the same result until she refused to eat unless these were moved out of her bowl.  So I decided my dog was picky and gave the rest of the bag to a co-worker because she said her dog would eat anything.  Well, she came and told me her dog just pushed around the food and didn't seem to like it either.  So, perhaps I picked a bad one? Or maybe it just tastes bad, nevertheless two dogs confirmed that it was not good.",0
"Such a cute dog house.  Came with an overpowering smell, but that seems to have gone away.  Cute and functional.  My two dogs switch off being inside.  My taller dog, rat terrier, jumps to the top balcony to use the top area.  It is for small dogs (15-20 pounds or less).",1
great,1
It came late and injured my cat within the first two minutes of use. The spinning mechanism spun her skin into it and wouldn't let go.,0
Great product that won't upset stomach of dogs,1
"My dog usually gobbles up the turkey sticks.  This time, however, he merely nibbles a little and leaves the crumbs all over.  In the past,  maybe one partial container has been bad.  This time,  every one (I ordered 4 containers) seems to be tainted.  I think I'll resort to trying to find something local that I can use as a substitute for the turkry sticks.",0
Works great and look great on the wall.,1
No longer seem to carry the large feeder. I even checked it on their site. Wrote an email and didn't get a response. This did not accommodate my big girls. Well is too small. Doesn't hold enough food and my girls are on premium food and don'the eat a lot. I ended up giving it to my little dogs and it is the perfect size for them. Bought a cheap 10# feeder for my 2 50#+ dogs.,0
My dogs love this! I have read up on the product & feel very comfortable feeding it to them. They especially love the lamb & rice flavor!,1
"For some reason both of my dogs hate this dog food. I have been mixing their food with wet food for the last 6 months, I decided to try a new puppy food for my 7 month old labradoodle, that was a bad decision, she will not eat her food when I mix it with this. I then tried it with my labrador same story! 2 stars is the most I can give it!",0
Hate these! Stiff and the name plate bends inwards. I wouldn't want it around my neck!,0
"My pooch chows anything , bites hole in all the toys. this is the only one that she has not been able to destroy !!!",1
Great product. Ive seen similar cages in local stores for twice the price. I have a very happy rabbit now.,1
Purchased for our husky. So far so good!,1
"We had tried so many beds for our two Jack Russell terriers -- every one of them was shredded to pieces within a week even the Kong indestructible beds. We switched to cots but it was very difficult to find one that was sturdy, contained ""non-chewable"" materials and would fit both dogs. We originally got a small K&H cot through a Groupon deal (I had figured why not for $20) and it was the best investment we made for the dogs! We have now moved to the large cot to accomodate both adult dogs (about 22lbs each). It is so sturdy (not flimsy at all), big, made of durable materials, easy to clean, the bedding part is a mesh-like material which makes it soft and bouncy when they lay on it. Bottom line our dogs love it and we love the fact we don't walk in to stuffing all over the floor! We got rid of our original cot one after ONE YEAR.. yes, the cot survived ONE year with our dogs. We wanted upgraded for the large size and the dogs love it just the same. This is a PERFECT cot if you have a destructive dogs or avid chewers.",1
The harness is great.  Dealing with Amazon and getting the right size was a real pain in the backside.  I ended up with THREE size smalls before I ever got my size MEDIUM.  The first one was my fault - the other two were shipped in an attempt to get a size exchange.  Finally I called and some sweet gal on the other end said the best way to do it is to just get a refund on the Small and then go back in and place a new order for the Medium.  Seems like it shouldn't be that complicated.  But I finally got the harness I needed and was happy with the quality.,1
"My dog used to think the neighbor dog was his mortal enemy. Pretty much every single time he went out in the backyard, he and the other dog would rush at each other through a small hole in the fence where they would bark like mad at each other, spending too much effort instigating the other's bad behavior. I purchased this collar to review and with ONE shock (set on a low number - 5, out of 100), my dog (who is a pretty large 70 pound guy) totally got the message and IMMEDIATELY stopped barking. He then crept over to the fence and to look at the other dog, but he did not bark. Perhaps, in his mind, that little dog used a magic spell on him, lol...I reinforced the concept several times with a short millisecond shock whenever he would rush over to the fence. It worked!.... bad behavior solved in under 48 hours, NO JOKE. Every single time he goes outside now, he completely ignores the neighbor dog or looks over by the fence where the dog is without barking. I'm amazed the collar worked so quickly. I also used the collar when I caught him digging. He immediately stopped and then found something else to do. So, the collar did what it was supposed to and it did so VERY quickly. I highly recommend it for that reason. Used correctly and responsibly, these collars are a miracle!
My dog is so accustomed to his training collar that I don't have to shock him now. All I have to do is SHOW him the remote, and he immediately stops whatever he is doing that is naughty and is on his belly at my feet in a second! I do have to reinforce it...when I stopped using the training collar, after a while, he would push his luck, but no shock required, as long as he has a reminder that I CAN shock him, he is a well behaved boy! A quick buzz when he's being ultra feisty or simply showing him that remote gets him back on track though and keeps him in check for a good period.
Highly recommended if you have a stubborn pup or need to train something specific. You won't be disappointed! I did receive a discounted collar in exchange for my honest and unbiased product testing and public review. I hope it has been helpful, please mark it helpful if you found it to be, thanks so much!",1
Best outfit I have got to date@,1
Works great with our Chihuahua !!!!!,1
Very happy with the purchase. It fits perfectly and it seems to be made with a sturdier plastic than the original.,1
it is ok for me,1
"This is a wonderful leash - it is so versatile. I like that I can wear it hands free around my waist if I want to use it hiking, or I can use it as a double leash with my two dogs (40 lbs and 80 lbs). The soft adjustable banding is nice, as well as the clasps so that I can attach my dog to the bench at the coffee shop with out having to undo the leash from her collar. Very easy to use - I would recommend to everyone in an instant!",1
"Our dog is now approaching 14 years, and had lately become uncharacteristically apathetic about her dry food, although she continued to wolf her canned food down with relish. Switching to ""Hill's Ideal Balance Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe"" seems to have rekindled her enthusiasm for dry food as well. We like that there is less filler in this diet, and no corn, soy or wheat (we've been told by our vet that those 3 ingredients are not really suitable for dogs; I suppose brown rice is better?).",1
Very small with bell inside it. More like a cat toy. Definitely not what I expected.,0
"I was skeptical about this stuff working but it does. I have two cats, but only one has worms. I feed them dry whisker lickin's treats every day. I dripped two drops on each little treat and let it dry. Then I feed them the treats as usual. They didn't seem to notice, which is unusual. I've never been able to feed them worm treatment as easily as this. I got tired of dripping the drops on their treats as it's time consuming. I decided just to put 15 drops in their water bowl. Again, they didn't notice a thing. The stuff worked after about three days. The worms began to disappear from the bedding where the infected cat sleeps. I know because I vacuumed it every day to see if the treatment was working. I also notice that both cats' bellies were slimmer, which told me both cats were infected. This product worked well for me and is easy to administer! I would recommend trying it. I bought a second bottle to continue the treatment another few weeks. Definitely worth the money if you consider how much the vet charges. The downside is that it takes a few days of effort to get it done.",1
"Before buying-manufacturer confirmed this product was safe and recommended for dogs (as the label and Leerburg states). I started feeding it to my 60lb German Shepherd at recommended rate. She immediately reacted negatively to her food, so I could tell she didn't like the smell or taste of the supplement. On the third and fourth day of feeding her this, she vomited. So I cut way back, and just put a finger ""pinch"" of supplement into her food. Tho this eliminated the vomiting, she still was reluctant to eat her food. So by the end of about the 6th day of feeding her the supplement, when she wouldn't eat her food at all, I quit. The next feeding, without the supplement in her food, she devoured her food, and has done so since - also without any further GI upset. I don't know if I got a defective batch or its just is not good for dogs. Here is one dog that did NOT like the product, and it caused her GI upset. Tho Amazon's provider - Horse.com refused to give me a refund, the manufacturer Grand Meadows was wonderful.  They were compassionate - did a full ""adverse event report"" they will share with other manufacturers, paid to ship the product to them and gave me a full refund. They indicated they will provide a free sample of ANY of their products to try before buying -so recommend you do this!",0
worthless and pretty sure it made one of them sick,0
"My dog loves to chew these out of his toys, so these are great for replacement.  Thank you!!",1
My dog stopped scratching after first bath,1
"I was expecting a much smaller dog can food! but these are the 22 oz cans and they are pretty big and well worth the money you pay! my dog loved it ate it all down with ease, at first she looked at it but once she ate it she could not stop",1
My dog likes it.,1
These work great. They keep my dog in one place but they still have enough tether strap to stand up and look out the window. These give me a feeling of security when I transport my dog anywhere.,1
No it doesn't work,0
"Great Product, came as described. KOI like it and haven't complained any.....",1
Working great so far. Seems to have taken a little bit of time - a few days - before the filter was allowing enough water out of the bowl but since then it has been working just fine.,1
"I bought this at Petsmart due to my puppy's trainer saying it was the least chemical and not as harsh as Frontline or Advantage. I didn't want to use anything but the flea situation is pretty nasty.

The product works on my 5 lb Yorkie for about 4 days. This is after she's lethargic on day one and has thrown up in a 36 hour period. I have used this product for 2 months with the same issues. Watching her not feeling well after applying is a red flag to me. And I don't understand all the fabulous comments when this product only works for 3 maybe 4 days. I use a flea comb dipped in Dr Mercola's flea tick spray and I mix with water. I do this 3 times a day and it's just about the only thing that helps.",0
"My cat loves these things! All I have to do is open the cabinet they ""live"" in and he comes running!",1
"It's the second time I'm ordering them from Amazon because I'm paying less than half what my local RadioShack charges for the exact same item. Of course, prices go up and down so be careful and make sure you bundle it with something else so you get free shipping.

Note that the exact same product is offered by other merchants through Amazon at what may appear to be lower prices. However, they charge for shipping and you may end up paying a lot more that you would if you ordered from Amazon in a 'free shipping' bundle.",1
"My niece asked me to order this for her, she does not have internet service, and she loves it very much.",1
The ID tag are great! They were exactly like I wanted. The only problem that I had was shipping. From what I can find out the post office lost the company's shipping tote.,1
Why dissapointed in this product. Its just cheap sanitary napkins. I could have bought them at the supermarket and saved $7.,0
It's good for kittens. Very small,0
None of these worked when they arrived. Only briefly until I changed batteries. I bought 3 packs of batteries hoping the batteries might have been bad. Disappointed. Received a refund,0
"This product has worked very well for my dog who was injured when a big dog knocked her around.  She actually asks me to put it on now. So, it must be relieving pain.",1
My dog loves these!,1
"I did not buy this item because I know you can buy 8lbs almost 2x as much for 9.97 at Walmart not on sale , but regular priced . I understand maybe a small difference but this is ridiculous .",0
"I replaced a five-year-old Petmate plastic fountain. In comparison, this model is much nicer looking, easier to clean, and equally if not more silent (a bare hum, less than a refrigerator, when standing over it, and inaudible from across the room).",1
My cat sure loves these items!  Pricey but not as bad as in the stores..........,1
"Have 2 Welsch Terriers, 25lbs.  One rarely sleeps on a bed but loves it.  We've had to order another.  Much more attractive than a typical flat foam bed and it appears both dogs are more relaxed and comfortable.  Going to be much easier to wash than the former beds, foam pads with a heavy,almost canvas cover.  Great product for smaller dogs.",1
1 of my 15 cats will eat these. The elderly ones I bought them for refuse to eat them at all.,0
This is a great lamp and projects perfectly. It is great for my uva/uvb bulb.,1
After a couple weeks cat ignores it.,0
"Nothing but some flat nylon webbing and some quick release buckles convenient yes, but as for the elastic no pull feature, dream on. Unless your dog exerts 2000lbs of pull then the web might stretch, but not likely, if you want some simple webbing harness it should work fine but don't expect any bungee type of give when your dog pulls on you.",0
Not worth it. Just a bunch of lousy cheap printed cards..,0
too small for kitten 4 mos old,0
My dog loves it.  That is enough said.,1
These crates are really well made and serve their purpose. The double doors really help in case you want to set it up a certain way in a room.,1
"Petcube tells you that poor video quality is a result of low internet speeds or router distance. My petcube was less than 10 feet from a N router and 50/10 MBPS speeds, and I was still lucky to get 240p video away from home.

And the laser pointer? Barely follows commands, especially from afar. If the camera covers 112 degrees of view, the laser pointer only oscillates maybe with the middle 60 degrees of that.

It's clear the company spent more time on the product's packaging than its internal components or firmware. It's not even worth $50, so don't spend $150/$200.",0
I honestly wouldn't waste your money. You have to use ALOT to cover kittens and they are not even that furry. And it didn't really seem to make a difference at all. Oh well lesson learned and money wasted.,0
This gets stuck all the time. I switched clumping litters to different brands and still gets stuck.,0
Lasted two days... a star for every day. My dog chewed through this with ease.,0
great !!!,1
Too big for the cats to chew.  They chewed a lot then walked away. Should have tested one bag. Have 5 left.,0
"Much larger than i thought. Full of water it weighs 15-20 lbs so don't just hang with an ordinary nail!  I put a plant in mine and some moss balls. Its very pretty on the wall.
Have a very small betta in mine also and it has plenty of room to swim and turn around. As it grows bigger i will put another baby sized betta in this bowl and place the bigger one in an aquarium. He seems fine and happy.",1
I am frequent buyer with Amazon and have bought many crate pads from them and others... this one did not measure up. It was not uniform in shape and not quite big enough for crate we have (Amazon purchase also I believe)... the black side is not heavy duty material IMHO and within short time it had begun to tear and dog could easily chew it and stuffing was coming out.. not safe to leave dog in a crate with a pad that is coming apart. Very disappointed.. had high hopes from others reviews... maybe we just got a lemon.. returning it.,0
Great Cover. I am replacing a Kurgo that was in a smaller car. This XL version fits perfectly in the rear seat of a Tundra Crewmax. I run spaniels inHunt Tests and Field Trials and they are in and out of the back seat often - this cover appears to stay in place well with the non-slip back and seat anchor tubes.,1
even the smallest size is too big and bulky for a small dog. Also only 1 of the two I ordered lit up. The return cost and hassle aren't worth it to me.,0
Using this in an outdoor fish pond and have the pump in an enclosed watertight housing with shielded breather openings and as long as the hose is not kinked it puts out a ton of small aeration bubbles just like it should.,1
"Water flow is good for the size of the unit and for the wattage used.  However, I can not recommend this unit because mine stopped working after five days of use in a marine aquarium.  Thank you Amazon for allowing me to return it for a full refund.  I will not be buying another Aqueon product.",0
"'Hate' seems strong, but these seemed a big blah for my two cats.  Neither cat showed any interest aside from some pawing at them as I held the rolls close to the cats.  Period.  That was it. I would not recommend these to any cat owner.",0
Great harness. Fit our 20 lb terrier easily. It's adjustable so would probably fit a dog a bit bigger too. I like how it doesn't restrict his shoulder movement. Great buy.,1
My dog loves these and it's a great value compared to what you pay at pet stores!,1
"Great product.  Works perfectly for my 2001 Chevy Tahoe.  I tried a inferior product for $23 on Amazon and it doesn't work for my huskies, I then bought this one and it works amazing!!! Thank you",1
"I purchased these as a substitute for rawhide.  Ive attempted to give them to my dog, my brothers two dogs, one of which will eat anything and to my neighbors dog who loves to get his treat through the fence.  Not one of them ate them.",0
"Will not buy these again. Did not work at all. Put it on my dog's collar as instructed, 48 hrs in advance and when he came home after we came back from vacation he had s total of 23 ticks we had to remove from every part of his body!!!",0
"Super soft, packaging was a bit excessive though. Dogs love it!",1
"These tags are are incredible! I recommend this product to anyone looking to get custom pet tags done.

Customer service was GREAT and delivery was fast! And these tags will not burn a hole in your wallet, they are sooo reasonably priced. They even contacted me to make sure my engraving info was correct.

I purchased the round stainless steel steel version and I am very pleased with the results, they can even engrave the front and the back! (On a select few)",1
My ferrets loved this food and got their stool to be of normal consistency. PLEASE DON'T BUY MARSHALLS FERRET FOOD!!!!,1
"Good Product. The mount could be a bit wider. It can sometimes be pushed by the puppies and loosened from the crate fencing.

Stainless steel bowl is easy to remove/clean without removing the entire unit.",1
Worst ever! I purchased this hoping to save the planet and some money by not buying the tape sheets. What a waste - the picture they show off coffee grounds: if you tried to roll again they would all fall off. Gets less sticky every time you wash and takes forever to dry. Save yourself the trouble and just use a vacuum.,0
"My dog learned to climb out of his pen and this top stopped Houdini (not his real name) from escaping.  Like other reviews mention, it would be nice if the straps had snaps on them, but it's not a deal breaker.  I have found that I don't need to secure the straps around where I open the pen.  As long as it's pulled down on the edges, my dog thinks he is stuck.  It's a life saver!",1
"We have 3 medium - large breed dogs and this is able to handle it all. I can skip a day or two and still pick up everything in one pass. It has held up very well, rubber / plastic grips & shovel clip are still in near perfect condition, color has not faded, Which is great considering it has gone through a Pennsylvania winter & summer being stored outside.",1
My dog was able to destroy this toy within 1 hour.  Not Invincible to say the least.,0
Ordering was easy. Delivery was on time. Box the food came in was damaged. 4 out of 12 tins damaged to the point where I could not feed this to my cat. Amazon was contacted regarding this but no response. This is the fourth time I have ordered canned cat food online. Twice everything worked out well. Once the damaged cans were replaced but this last time I was given no response. Back to PetSmart!,0
My Golden's favorite toy!  It has lasted 4 weeks and still going strong!,1
"Last 2 or 3 orders, the top of the plastic container has been cracked. The container leaks when used. Product itself is fine.",1
"I can't say it has helped him lose weight because he eats everything that is in his path so there are other contributing factors, but he loves it and it is a healthy, high quality food.",1
cats FAVORITE TOY !!!! SHE LOVES THESE BALLS,1
It's terrible. There's no other way to put it. Cheap. Plastic. Junk. The flow from the pump is far too aggressive and my partner suggested it was so noisy she thought it was going to start vibrating across the table. You are far far better off with a 5 gallon All Glass and a corner filter. This is just junk.,0
A GOOD PRICE ON THE BEST FLEA CONTOL EVER!!,1
"No easy way to close these.  Don't ""waste"" your money on these.",0
Our puppy scratches on the outside of the glass slider when he wants to come in. He is starting to make permanent scratches in the glass. The Paw-Gard only covers a small area of the glass. It also stayed on the door for less than a week before falling off.,0
Puncture extreamley easily. On each walk anywhere from 1 to all 4 are unusable afterwards,0
Does not get stains out like advertised. Will not be buying this product again.,0
What a great addition to our fish tank! Can't say enough about how amazingly cool it looks! Have received many compliment on it as well from guests. Looks like a real erupting volcano! You won't be disappointed!,1
Very misleading.  Picture of item shows it with a collar but when it was recieved there was no collar.  Had to order collar separately from another vendor and ultimately paid more plus shipping.  Unit works fine....my problem is not with Tri-tronics but with Amazon.,0
My cat loves this stuff,1
I had bought one and liked it so I bought another.,1
"This product worked so well that we are now fighting a flea infestation in our house with our children having flea bites and the dog having to be shaved and treated by the vet. So yeah, only buy if you want to feel like the worst parent ever and want to spend $100s to feel sorta, kinda, maybe clean again.",0
"I got this to replace a European lead that was 8+ years old and that was fraying due to too many chewing incidents.  There's only so many repairs you can make to an old lead before you have to throw in the towel...!

NOTE: the ""gold"" is more of a tan with a slight sheen, not a blingy gold.

The good:
- European-style leads are a great design for training as they allow for flexibility in how you loop the lead.  You can: 1) use it as a single long 6' leash by making a small loop at one end, 2) shorten it to a 4' leash by hooking one end to the D-ring at the other end, 3) use it as a temporary tie out if you need to run inside a store very quickly. (PLEASE never leave your dog unattended too long, but a few minutes is okay!!)
- Unlike my original lead, this one is double-thick (two-layers of nylon), so I think it'll be more durable.
- All the stitching and reinforcements on the stress points look good, very well-made.

The bad:
- The double-thick construction, while more sturdy, makes the lead much more heavy than a single layer one.  It also makes it less flexible/supple so you can't throw in a small bag like a fanny pack or shove it into your pants pocket to run to the park for training as easily.

The double-layer construction is good and bad, but it really comes down to how you are using it.  I think this is a very good leash if you have a potential chewer.  If you don't and just want flexibility and options in a leash, you may want to opt for a single-layer option.",1
"Horrible, the hole is to big and even the smallest treats fall out. Would not recommend. Rip OFF.",0
To grease,0
The bow is really big and does not fit small enough for her neck. However the shirt is cute.,1
"returning item,worked for about 10 minutes my dogs hair is only1 and a half inches long completely stopped cutting the hair this is the secound wahl clippers ive purchased,first ones from walmart had to return them also",0
Needed for a Bichon puppy 9 weeks old.  It fit under the Delta airplane aisle seat.  I think it would be hard to fit a bigger bag under the seat however.,1
It was broken upon arrival,0
Good. Use it everyday for my dog. He seems to like it. A little expensive though.,1
"Yes, I have used it before and it is the best thing to have it rather than the small size pad.",1
Not working on my doggy's stinky breath...And i use it faithfully...,0
"We also ordered the blue shrimp along with these little guys at the same time. They first of all make sure they are secure and well insulated when shipping. They will not ship if it is too hot or cold out. My order took a few weeks to ship, but I ordered them (early January) when the temperatures were cold. But well worth the wait as my shrimp all came in a live and are healthy!

They do sometimes lose color in the shipping process, but the color will return! My are getting very vibrant just in the last 24 hours I've had them. In my photo they had only been in there for about 6 hours.  They came with great instructions on how to get them acclimated to your tank and wonderful background on the owners. They make sure you know they are true to their word and will make their customers happy.

These have been a wonderful addition to our tank. My children and I love to sit and watch them swim around. They are some lively little guys/girls!",1
This Jumpsuit will keep my pup warmer this cold winter.  Putting on the jumpsuit can be a little difficult.  The suit is put on from underneath the animal then zipped up on top.  The draw strings do not have a clip to keep the tension in place along the mid underbelly and chest.,1
Previous reviews critiqued the feeder for it's inability to deliver consistent portion sizes; they were correct.  The feeder did not measure and deliver 1 Cup portions as advertized.  The smallest I measured was about 2 Cups which is way too much for our needs. We're feeding a feral cat and don't want extra food left in the tray after she has eaten. We purchased another rotary unit that has five feeding trays but we have to measure the portion size; it works well but if we're on vacation someone needs to re-fill it after five feedings.,0
Stopped working after 2 days. Would not recommend this.,0
"I assume the product works as advertised.  I gave it to our dog and he had a reaction to it - it contains dextrose and my dog is diabetic.  My fault for not researching the product but I could not find the label info - not one of the images provided on Amazon.  This is not a review of the product, more a criticism of Amazon - all supplements should have label info posted on all sizes.",0
"my dogs both loved chewing on it, they are American Bull dogs and it seemed ok at first well for about 3 days. About day three, my daughter came flying into my office, screaming that my dogs mouth was bleeding and he had blood all over his muzzle when I ran into the living room! I looked around an this toy was on the ground, and the ends were very jagged and sharp where his teeth had torn into the plastic! This toy was literally shredding his mouth and gums! I threw it out immediately! Do not buy this toy for a large chewing dog.",0
"What a fantasist product! I ordered this for my two dogs, Scarlett and Cupcake, for the winter months. I noticed a immediate difference after using the Paw and Nose Lotion. Their paws were softer and the pups seemed to be happier. It smells great. Not too strong and just what you expect from Burts Bees. I love all Burts Bees products.  I use Burts for all sorts of personal care items. Never thought about puppy care! I am so happy to see Burts made a product for animals. Safe, healthy and perfect for my dogs from a trusted brand. Highly recommend.

I highly recommend.",1
Wasn't what I was looking for,0
"I used to buy this brand for several years. The bag I purchased in Sept 2017 didn't get used until recently as I didn't realize I had an unopened bag from a month prior. When I used this most recent bag, it was not the same. The litter turns into mud and sticks to the box. It's really nasty trying to clean it up. Why did they change the formula? Also,there is never any consistency in price. $13 one day $20 the next.",0
So much simpler than shoving pills down my sweet dogs throat. She loves both the peanut butter and chicken flavor. Keep the bag sealed as they are moist and will dry out slightly and crumble. Wonderful product.,1
"I have put this out several times, hoping to entertain my indoor cats with ""bird TV"". It sits in the tray untouched. Even when I dumped it out in the yard, no one wanted it. Perhaps I got a bad batch? No idea. I have never seen birds turn down seed before.",0
"Our two piggy's wouldn,t touch they're water bottles for a week after adding this..  As soon as we gave them back they're old water they started drinking again.. cant recommend.",0
I originally bought the ball as a challenge to see how many times I could get the ball replaced before the company would tell me ok no more... but she has not destroyed it once... love it!!,1
Perfect size for our 2 doxies,1
"My dog didn't want to be on the bed, the waterproof lining makes a lot of noise every time he moves, it's not cushioned enough, an all around bad choice for our animal.  Perhaps with a smaller dog, this bed would work?  Still would be pretty noisy though... I wouldn't recommend this bed.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck with two of them.",0
"What is there to say.  They are well made and work  And most important, my cats like them.",1
"Great taste for my cat, loves it!",1
The item is smaller than it says. I have a 9 lb dog and ordered a small and I couldn't even buckle it.,0
Used it for our baby puppies.  It did it's job well.,1
Didn't last more than 4 months,0
"Perfect fit for my 5lb yorkie/Haveneese mix. She likes wearing it, don't dig or pull on legs. Perfect and good quality.",1
Great product...fast shipping!,1
its so tiny i can barely read it and when i added a heating pad under the tank the line barely moved so im not sure if its very accurate.,0
"At first we thought this would be great. However the velcro does not stick well to the product (it does stick to the window sill). So when the cat jumped up he would sit and then it would fall off the wall. I tried three different glues to hold the velcro to the bottom of the seat and it just kept falling off. I finally used hot glue and now it stays up, unfortunately the cat is now afraid of it (since it seemly fell every time he sat on it) and he won't give it a try. He does not trust it and thus it sits unused.",0
"K&H, I'm very disappointed!  I bought this exact perch over three years ago which was fantastic for 3 years, but due to recent move, I reattached the perch & tightened too tightly, which broke the plastic screw back.  So I bought a new perch, but found it's not made like before. Within a few days, it ticks every few seconds. This is scary. So I exchanged it for another & again, ticks. It's winter right now & the bird needs a warm perch. K&H was gracious in refunding & letting me keep the defective perch. Amazon removed them for a short period until the problem was fixed since others have complained about similar problems. Meanwhile, the perch stopped ticking, but was no longer warm. Last week, I checked back & see they're back on Amazon again. I ordered another perch in hopes the problem has been fixed. Not so! Within a few days, my latest perch (third one in 2 months!) is ticking. But at least it's warm this time! Hope the ticking doesn't end up in an electrical fire!

UPDATE:  Amazon graciously replaced the perch with another one.  We're now on the FOURTH perch in 2 months. As with the others, within a day, the ticking began. It's now been one week since receiving this latest perch & I just went to check on it as I no longer hear the ticking.  Guess what?  It's COLD!!!  It no longer works--in just one week or less!!  I believe a recall is needed & K&H Manufacturing will need to go back to the drawing board & figure out what they're doing differently than many years ago. This is very disappointing!",0
Great value for the price. My dogs loved it and less limping from my dog with hip dysplasia.,1
"loved it. esp the recording. my roommate kept forgetting to feed my dog, now i have no worries and need no-one to feed my bundle of joy. he can eat on time everyday. i love the feeder.

Update: 3 weeks later
I went out of town for 12 days and came back to see the feeder isn't dispensing the food. The recording goes off but it's not letting the food out. So I changed my rating to a 1 star. I'd give it 0 but that's not an option. I'm sending it back. It had many good reviews but sometimes it doesn't work for everyone. The most important thing is to feed my pet. So it's a fail.",0
"These collars are so helpful for our puppies as they love to run around outside and since their fur is dark brown, a collar like this really helps to spot them!",1
"Way to unstable for my 12 lb cat! she is scared to death of it since every time she tries to go in it wobbles. It doesn't matter which surface, it is just way too unsteady for a big cat!",0
"The "" Da Bird"" arrived in a timely manner but was very poorly constructed. The string that attaches to the pole was very thin and after we played with our 4 month old kitten, twice, the string was nearly threadlike. The feather attachment came apart after the second less than 15 minute play. We attached the next feather toy  to the pole and that one also lasted 15 minutes, leaving feathers on the floor.  What we received does not look like the photo...Our friends purchased a"" Da Bird"" toy at Petco and it was  of much better construction. Would not purchase this again..",0
does not work for my dog,0
"My dog is a two-year-old, 53 pound, Australian Shepherd. He's a tough chewer and a toy doesn't last long (even the $25 toys that are suppose to be ""unbreakable""). We give him retriever bones and tough rubber toys, but I thought this would be a nice mix. A tough toy that he can't eat or rip chunks out of....

I read the reviews and I noticed some people were concerned with how tough the toy was... but I also read comments stating that dogs wouldn't be ""stupid"" enough to break their teeth on the toy. Well, my Aussie is anything but stupid and last night he broke one of his front teeth (non-canine) all the way up to the gums....

Maybe this toy would work for a tough chewer that wasn't a DETERMINED chewer? I don't know. All I know is that this toy cost my dog his TOOTH! Even with watching him diligently while he played with this toy, I wasn't able to notice until it was too late and the tooth was broken.

If you are thinking about buying this toy, I would suggest you know your dog and his chewing style. If he makes chewing his job, PLEASE don't buy this toy. No matter how strong of a chewer he is...his teeth won't be as strong.",0
"Smaller than I expected and harsh, rough material. Feels like a brillo pad. My elderly cats love a warm bed or small place to curl up, but they didn't seem to recognize this as such. I'm giving it to Goodwill.",0
"So I was looking for a stylish black aquarium heater. Looks great in the pictures. I thought all heaters are the same, who cares who makes them. Opps on my part. I followed all the directions and tested it out. Within ten minutes I could smell a slight burnt metal smell. Looking at my tank I could see small bubbles shooting from the bottom of the unit and a nice big piece of glass at the bottom of my tank. Luckly no fish died but I had to listen to my girlfriend nag about you get what you pay for... got rid of it tonight and will contact amazon about returning the heater in the morning.",0
"love it! my dog looked sooooo good in this costume.
great price and good quality.",1
Put the collar on the minute it arrived & it worked on day one! The collar did the trick! The tail chasing & running in circles barking no longer is a problem!,1
"soft , somwhat reflective. nice soft looped grip.",1
"Specifically, the cats hate it. They won't go near it. Went on vacation and the housekeeper found a pile of untouched food spilling out of the bowl, onto the floor. They would rather starve than eat from the monster.",0
Our cat didn't take to these treats. He is a chewer but didn't like this.,0
"Instead of this collar I got a complete in ground fence set that was obviously used, had water damage, and was returned.  Collar was way too big for my small dog and not the correct item.",0
A great collar. I had a very hard time finding a collar big enough for Shiloh Shepherd. This collar fits well and is made well. We have had it for almost a year and it is still in perfect shape. Even with the German Shepherd tugging on it when they play.,1
"I tested 12 rolls, every single one had the bottoms of the bags sealed in the folded position, so the bags could not be opened fully. This is a manufacturing defect and shows they have no quality control. I am returning the whole box.
Update: Company contacted me after my review was posted and explained that the bottoms of the bags were intentionally designed this way to prevent leaks. I suggested they update the product listing to show this and they did. The listing now shows the bottoms and there is an explanation in the text. I did get a refund and they also sent me some other bags with standard bottoms. The new bags work as required. I suggest the orange bags should be used for smaller dogs, mine are 65 lbs.  The bags are thick enough to resist tearing.",1
"I've used this twice, for two cats traveling via plane in the cabin with me. Both times, didn't calm them. Does nothing when used at home in usual settings. Doesn't appear to affect them at all.",0
"My persian cat started to eat this and the next day he started to throw up. One star until someone explains to me how the transition to this food is supposed to happen. I mixed it with his previous food as I am supposed to gradually switch to the new food, but my cat doesn't look like he will try it ever again, I would have to starve him to make him eat it again. My other persian did not threw it up, but she did not like it. Now I am stuck with a 7 lbs bag that none of my cats like. Disappointing.",0
It was much smaller than I was anticipating.  It's also not that hard for chewing. Dog doesn't really use it.,0
For a small tank I recommend getting these rocks. Great color and no issues when I added them to my fish tank.,1
It flips easily with pet inside as wheels are too small. Flaps on all sides should open for ventilation and have buttons to keep them open,0
the vet recommended NOT giving these to the dogs.,0
"If you have some chewers, forget this product and all the Skinneez products.",0
Used it for two days and there was a huge hole and we heard our dog choking on the stuffing inside. Very scary.,0
Don't even bother with these. My wire-haired fox terrier destroyed the first one in less than an hour.,0
Bought this for our 4 lb Chihuahua and it fits him perfectly.  He didn't mind wearing it which was a nice surprise.,1
This stuff really works.  I just spray my bostons once a week and they are good.  So much better for them than all the chemicals.,1
"Horrible waste of money, nothing works my husband is a masters electrician and could not get it to work we are returning it",0
"We love this toy. Our dog is a Pharaoh Hound/Pit mix and normally tears toys apart in under an hour. She is on her third one in a year. We had been given the small one as a gift and it wasn't strong enough, but the large one lasts a very long time. Her first large one lasted 8 months and we only took it away because she had gotten a small chunk out of the top. Definitely a good product for dogs who are power chewers.",1
"Love these for keeping the nest dry.  But, by themselves, they are NOT a good nesting material.  I augment this pad with straw on top.  My hens don't like laying their eggs on such a non-nest material.  But, it sure makes clean up easier as my hens tend to ""mess in their nest"" on occasion.",1
"It does an awesome job in the beginning. But a month later and it was already running slow.
Planning on buying another but a much larger one in hopes that it'll keep up ",0
They were too hard. Had to order others before these finished because my dog was having issues chewing them. They would end up squirting and she smelled of fish bad. Forgot about saving money and went back to the ones I got before (tri-omega capsules).,0
does not work well,0
great,1
It's seems well built and good in size,1
Thought I was getting 4 toys (one each shown) ordered 2 got 2 toys not 2 sets. Over paid for what I received,0
"We have every dog/ cat food dispensing toy ever invented-Buster Cube, Buster Bone, etc. but so far this seems to be the favourite for both dog and the cats.
I like that the level of challenge can be easily adjusted.  When all 3 inserts are used it keeps my Golden racing around the house for quite a long time, that bushy tail wagging happily.  It's great that the kibble can not only be heard rattling around but seen in the clear ball as well, keeping her interested far longer than any other food dispensing toy.
Oddly, my 2 adult cats have taken a liking to this toy as well and despite it's size they can push it around on carpeting easily.  Even using smaller pieces of dry cat food it is still challenging enough to keep the little furry monkeys out of trouble for a long time as they both work together to get to the food.
I will sometimes use freeze-dried treats that both the dog and cats like and all 3 will team up on the ball.",1
been feeding it to my golden for the first year of his life along with a mixture of another dry food. no side effects and well worth using prime to ship it. no need to go to the store and lug a big ole bag around,1
Nice lavender scent. Bags hold up well and the handles help. Great buy.,1
It was a nice little package but I could have purchased all of the stuff in it for half the price.,0
Too hard for puppies,0
This just did not help with training my dog.  Maybe some one else would have better luck than I did.,0
"My dog loves this toy! She likes to throw it up in the air, bounce it, chew it, play tug of war with it, make it squeak, etc. She is pit bull and destroys anything that has stuffing so this has been a good purchase!",1
My dog absolutely loves these! He is a lab and these are the perfect size for him to retrieve when he is swimming!,1
"Absolutely worthless... We have merged two households with 2 cats in each. My two, 2-3 year old cats who are normally sweet and loving, and get along well with other cats, won't stop hazy one of the other two. I put the collars on both and neither one were phazed in the least over the next 3 weeks. I even put another new one on the most agressive of the two, nothing. And honestly unless you love the smell of lavender you will quickly fet tired of the smell coming off the collars.  I was also very apprehensive about the fact that these collars are no way safety collars. My cats are very active and if caught on something there is no way it would release.",0
"My Jack Russell Terriers love antler bones, but for some reason, are not crazy about these ones.  Since I opened the package and gave them 2 already, I cannot return them.  The dogs seem to prefer their rawhide bones to these bones.",0
"I received this quickly, but the gargoyle was in pieces. It had no protective padding at all, the worst packaging I have ever seen for a fragile item. The Book was surprising intact, and is very pretty.",0
"This litter box sucks! I adopted two 6 month old kittens in August and bought this litter box and signed up for the automatic litter refill delivery shortly after. I was very excited, at first. It took about a month before I went out and bought a standard replacement for it. Here are the negatives:odor control is not better than standard scoopable litter, it's much worse; the automatic waste screening worked for about a month and a half, now you have to push the button to get it to move; cats got freaked out with cover and started howling one night, the crystals do not last as long as advertised. I am very disappointed with this product, save your money!",0
"This rain coat is absolutely adorable! It is very good quality, you can immediately tell that it is of quality material. Does not feel cheap like my dogs other rain coat. She was very comfy in it and did not mind having it on.",1
Vet recommended.,1
"My four cats all eat hard cat food (Merrick's Before Grain Chicken).  Use the FF Gravy Lovers as they all love to lap up the gravy, as a way of them getting moisture.",1
"ASSEMBLE IS A BEAR.  You MUST look first at parts list and see how the rear axel is assembled..Those red things are the brakes.  Then attach wheels, the part with the gears goes inside, the washer and then pin then the plastic cap.  The whole thing is then pushed down on to two back rear side bars with the holes in the brakes matching side bars.  Front must be pushed down until the front pole clicks under the small extension. Nothing seems to click securely. For this much money it should have been better quality parts and more explanation.",0
"Beware, half year sales record for 2014 is being collected, prices are going to be jumping up and down for the next month until the end of May.. Yesterday I bought this for $4.46 now its $9.45. This is happening all over Amazon. So just be careful. The Habitrail OVO maze was $15. then overnight it went to $30.40, then two days later went down to $19.40. Just be sure the price is what you want to pay because all of a sudden it will shoot down once more.",0
It was ripped apart within 8 minutes of giving it to our puppy. he is about 10 months old. It literally unraveled and left strings all over the house and outside area. It didn't last...would not recommend for a chewer.,0
SATISFIED,1
My 12 year old dog loves this stuff and it seems like her joints are not hurting as much.,1
This food was lighter in color and a different consistency than Taste of the Wild. It was replaced with something else. Do not buy this from Amazon.,0
This was supposed to fit my Infiniti g37. However it didn't remotely fit.  I tried to make the best of it and it is now completely falling apart.  I have to vacuum the shredded fibers off of it weekly (my dogs have only ridden on it 2 times as they aren't in my car often). The straps also pulled completely apart.  It isn't from being too tight.  The cover is actually too big for my car seat.  I would like to return or request a refund but it isn't an option apparently. I am was highly disappointed.,0
"I'm pretty unhappy with this purchase. It came rolled up into a tube that had a dent in the side. When unrolled, the dent was seen all over the plastic. The adhesives included did not hold the plastic onto our sliding glass door longer than a couple of hours.",0
Excellent trait very heavy but great for an escape artist,1
The tool cuts much better than any single cut tool.  This gives you a lot more leverage to cut thicker branches.,1
"After using it for a couple weeks the water began to get backed up on the back side of the filter and instead of flowing over and into the tank some of the water pushed back out the back over the clip and onto the counter. It did this very slowly and not at first. After adjusting it a few times the issue kept occurring, overall I would not recommend this over all.",0
Not meant for larger dogs takes forever to trim the nail due to the fact that it gets hot quickly because not a lot of power,0
"This is a good, easy to use ear cleanser. We have a dog who occasionally gets something irritating in his ear. This bottle is easy to use and works well to get the gunk out.",1
Had absolutly zero scent! Very disappointed!,0
Lasted 3 days,0
"These are some of the stinkiest treats and create horrible breath - HORRIBLE.  That said, the dogs will do anything for these treats.  They are a bit on the pricey side, so these are special treats and not every day treats.",1
Much easier than a regular brush.,1
"My dog loves them, gets a couple every day.",1
"We have three very active dogs and this is the only tag that has held up to them.  The engraving lasts even if it rubs against another tag (like a rabies tag).  My dogs are a 90 lbs Boxer/Dane mix, 90 lb AmStaff, and 55 lb pocket pittie.  The previous tags I ordered all broke off at some point so I ordered these and they have been going strong for months.  The turn around time for engraving and shipment was very reasonable (less than a week).  Thank you!",1
"This worked for one day! I did some trouble shooting and it still doesn't work. It was a complete waste of money.

I bought this to use as a bark collar and realized that the one without a remote works much better. It was a pain having to make sure I had the remote with me every time my dog barked.

This collar, had it worked for more than a day, would have been ideal for any other kind of training.",0
"These are definitely only good for young puppies and small dogs if you're looking for it to last more than a few minutes. My 15-lb jack-a-bee can get through one in under 5 minutes. But, on the bright side, he has a treat for 5 minutes! He really does seem to love them, too. Even though he eats them pretty fast, I will continue to buy them.",1
"I am disappointed in the cages - I ordered 6 of them and wish I had been smarter and only tried one before I ordered all of them - anyway - with much struggle, I got the cages together -however, the connecting devices are very fragile and not easy to use - the pieces that go on the bottom of the cage are unreliable - and the rats are busy chewing some of the connectors that hold the shelves in place - I find the cages hard to clean. The cages are ample in size though, but I am disappointed with them overall.  I have to order more connectors since some of them are already broken - will not order Machiorio again.",0
Worked well for about a month!  Plastic fasteners are flimsy and litter leaks out when turning the box.  Clumped litter sticks on the the grate - big mess!!  Going back to scooping up poop and clumps!!,0
"This stuff is AMAZING! It cleared up a urine spot on the carpeting that several other products seemed to just mask. I also like that the product itself does not have a heavy scent, so it does not create a strong odor in the house after spraying it.

7/20- Back again to update this review. I love this stuff! So my sister bought a really cool vintage dress from a thrift shop, but it had HORRIBLE body odor scents in the armpit area that did not come out after several washes. (Not sure how she didn't notice when she bought it!!) As a last resort before trashing it, I sprayed some Bubba's on the offending area and let it sit for a few hours. Threw it in the wash and to my surprise the odor is gone! So incredible!",1
"I purchased this crate for weekend trips for my 9 month old goldendoodle.  She is crate trained and has never chewed anything or scratched anything in the house.  While the crate was very easy to set up and the canvas seemed durable enough there are screens on the side & front door.  We put her in it -at our mountain home (so she knew where she was and was not afraid) -she must have jumped up on the front screen and it just ripped.  I file her nails so they are not sharp.  So basically the crate she was in for 3 hours is worthless to us.  I just feel that a ""dog crate"" should be made with more durable products.",0
Wish it was the original because that was excellent.  Now I'm using Sweatscoop but although it clumps well it doesn't handle the odor of the ammonia well at all.  I scoop every day once a day and the ammonia makes my eyes water.  Yesterday I got some PDZ from Hollywood feed store and sprinkled a very thin layer of it in the litter box after moving all the litter to one end and then brought the litter back over the PDZ.  Today I haven't yet scooped the litter box and there is NO odor although there are the usual clumps of urine in the box.  I am going to change litter though as I am worried that the wheat mix the litter is composed of may develop aflatoxin in time and I don't want to expose my cat or myself to that.  I think I'm going to get some of the horse stall pine pellets suggested by so many reviews here and use the PDZ under it since I now know that WORKS.,0
"My dogs LOVE these so much it's ridiculous.  They smell pretty good for dog cookies and the shapes are cute (although I think the dogs could care less).  They have a nice variety of flavors and the different sizes mean I don't have to break big cookies into pieces for my littlest mutt, Abigail.  If I would let them, they would eat these instead of their regular meals.  The bulk bag is much cheaper than the grocery store boxes (I paid over $5 for a 20 ounce box at the grocery store) and the bag is re-sealable.  The only difference is the cookies in the bag are not as thick or as big as the ones in the box I bought 2 weeks ago at the store but that's not a big deal but the difference is negligible.",1
Cats would not sit still for it.,0
"Not the Highest quality so it wouldn't really do for a bigger dog but since mine is smaller and I didn't know what size to get this worked great. I also don't need to use it for any kind of long term, just a few minutes here and there so I don't know how long it will end up lasting.",1
"I have a husky, and I've tried this out, but I'm not exactly sure what it's supposed to do. For me, it's been a waste of money because it doesn't get any hair out.",0
nice,1
My little docile cat took it off in less than a minute. I even wrapped a gauze through it to tighten it and he had the collar off with the gauze still wrapped around his neck. Its so much easier to take off because there is a lot of material to work with n it slips right off. I tried deflating it and try and work it that way. It didn't help. Great concept if it was useable. Had to go back to using the dreaded ecollar given by the vet after his neutering surgery. It looks uncomfortable but at least I know he won't be able to take that off and mess up his stitches.,0
"I recently renovated my kitchen with floor tile that must be kept water-free. I bought this mat hoping that would be the case, as my dogs tends to slop water over the sides of the bowl. When I picked it up after a few days of use, it was totally wet. I wish I could return it. A bath towel worked better thatn this product.",0
Thought the price was a misprint. It wasn't. Great deal.,1
I ordered a flea and Tick collar and I received a Training collar and I can not return the product cause I am in Dominican Republic.,0
"our cat hated them, then took them off within 20 minutes.",0
Great bowls!  Definitely worth the price.,1
"My older cat is relentless when she wants a treat, scurrying for the kitchen if I so much as head in that direction.  She'll eat some of the other brands, but only half-heartedly.  What she wants is Party Mix!  I've had to go to the store and get some when I had other treats in the cupboard, because she's so set on these.  It doesn't have to be Beachside -- though she does like this kind -- but Party Mix outranks them all in her eyes.",1
"Awful, stiff, prickly, can't even stand to handle it, wouldn't dream of putting it on my little one.",0
"We have a 14 year old golden. Two years ago he was having a tough time getting up stairs, now he's doing so much better. We order the horse solution and just cut it way down, it's a little cheaper. Would recommend this product.",1
My girl loves them!!,1
Great product would buy again,1
Reasonably priced and easy to put together. My cat loves it and has no trouble getting to all three  levels.,1
Make my English Bulldogs smell so nice.,1
"Perfect size for 20 pound bag of food, fits in the pantry nicely, I love that the lid snaps shut tightly and the wheels on the bottom  make it easy to pull in and out of the pantry .",1
It comes kind of big but I didn't returned I sew it,1
"We liked the 1st one so much, we bought a 2nd.",1
I didn't really see great results.  I used the entire container before writing a review and I didn't really see results and wound up ordering angels' eyes instead,0
As described & works great,1
"Seller shipped quickly, I will be purchasing from them again for my fountain supplies. This takes the expense out of my wonderful pet water fountain, my cats love it so much and they drink plenty of water because if it. The price was great, and the large size will keep me well supplied for my pet filter needs. The quality is great.",1
"This was the best i did trial over 2 wk time and it worked fabulously. No odors,  no mess!!! Lived it. Thanks for the opportunity",1
Great!,0
Decent sized litter pans for the price but unfortunately one of them came broken and I don't feel like dealing with returning it.,0
My 3 month old 7 lb schnauzer destroyed this in less than 5 minutes. It's cute but poorly made. The description of it being dog proof is false.,0
I have to cut it by myself :(,0
"I really thought my cats would love this post. One of my cats really does use it, but one ignores it. Neither of them will sit on it because it falls when they jump on top. Also, the seat does not stay in place. So it seems really unsturdy to them. I definitely would not buy it again at the same price.",0
"Winston Churchkill loves his new harness! Fits perfect, and he's not trying to rip it of himself- im assuming he finds it comfortable. If you get the sizing correct, you'll love it!",1
"Buyers with dogs who are allergic to chicken BEWARE.  The description says that the product contains ""no chicken byproduct meal""  As it turns out, this does NOT mean that the product does not contain chicken.  In fact, the first ingredient is ""chicken meal"" and the second is ""chicken fat"", the operative word being ""with"" pasture fed lamb.  That they would assume that the typical consumer will know that ""chicken byproduct meal"" and ""chicken meal"" are two different things  (if indeed they even are) is absurd.  Now I'm dealing with a poor dog with projectile diarrhea and a useless bag of expensive dog food.",0
"Wheels broke off in about two months. Very disappointed because initially, it seemed great and was easy to maneuver. The plastic around the wheel insert just snapped with little stress.
UPDATE!!!!!!
So annoyed!  Contacted by a rep about my negative review shortly after the original post. I responded and was so impressed that someone from the company responded. NO FOLLOW THROUGH.  Insult to injury!  Just threw the container out yesterday after looking at my mend job with duct tape.  The rep stated in the email that I probably got a faulty product, and apparently I did  but to email me and not follow up on my response is poor customer service. I drew the short straw on this one because everyone else pretty much raves about the product.",0
"Nice size - seems sturdy- glad it is ""earth friendly""",1
"Really cheaply made, not worth the cheap price. Use your money for something else. Can't return it, I'd only get $1 refund. You'd be better off kicking $6 towards a local shelter.",0
"Although this catches the seeds well, when my bird would climb down the bars of his cage to get to his food dish, his claw would get caught in the netting.  I would not recommend this.",0
"I really love the material of the leash but like everyone said here, the clip is horrible. I live downtown and more than 4 times we had to chase our dog down the street because the clip slipped. I finally threw it away and I'm going to find a different leash. It's a shame because it's such a soft leash.",0
"I have had this bed for my 84 lb young female dobie for over a year now and I think its safe to say both she and I love it.  About 6 months in the cover started to tear at the front seam, I emailed the company, and they promply sent me a brand new cover.  I havet had any problems with the new one yet.  It is easier than most to just unzip and throw in the washer.  The memory foam mattress on it is very thick and supportive (I get a little jealous sometimes and wish I could sleep on it).  It is a little more on the pricey side, but in my opinion worth it.  Oh!  Not to mention it fits like it was MADE for the doggie bed I built for her.",1
always does the job for 3-4 weeks whether I order the small cat or the large cat,1
My Dog loves these!  Good choice.,1
our puppy tore it apart within 10 minutes,0
Every Can Came Bent And Crushed!,0
"My teddy bear hamster loves this larger size ball which can be hard to find even in larger pet stores. The top locks very sturdily in place and I have had no problem with it coming undone as long as it is properly latched. Hamsters can't exactly see very well so I do not believe color matters very much, this is just what was available. The clear does show any dirty or lint picked up so it will need to be cleaned.",1
"So I decided to take advise from a few reviews saying that they tried it on their own heads and it helped but no way! I made my head so bad and itchy, it felt it worse off. I can't say if it would help your pet but it is definitely not made for humans...",0
"I shouldn't put a star but i can't post my review without a single star....the delivery was fast enough and i appreciate it.my only concern is the sizing.before purchasing this product,i read the reviews first.one review is telling that a small can fit a 23lb schnauzer so im thinking that medium will fit my acs and a small will fit my miniature poodle but when the items arrived,OH MY GOD!the sizing are waaaaaayyy tooooooo small! the medium size firs my miniature poodle and the small?i think it'll fit one's finger.it's not for dogs,i guess! the quality?well,it's priced that way thus am not expecting an excellent quality.i'd be returning the items.don't buy this product if you don't want to waste ur money!",0
I tried everything and then my trainer recommended this.  Saved my back and my wrist.  Dog doesn't pull anymore.  You must be VERY careful to it the harness properly or else it will rub under his legs and cause a rash.,1
Like the concept but base broke the day we received it. Still able to use it but don't know for how much longer will hold up.,0
"Within one day of use one of the seams came apart almost halfway across the section that covers the floor of the car. I was going to return it, but it took 5 days more than expected to deliver. So I repaired it myself.",0
I noticed blood from my dogs gums when he started playing with this. After that I am hesitant to give it to my dog. Do not suggest this for all dogs.,0
great product love it,1
It lasted my Weimaraner about 20 minutes. It was in 4 pieces by then.,0
Excellent plants. Healthy. Full. Large. My fish love them.,1
This thing does NOT WORK. All the reviews for it are fake.,0
"Sorry, but this simply did not make ANY impact on my dog's barking.  Even when in audible mode the dogs just barked over the noise.  If you get this, be prepared to bring in a trainer to help you teach the dog to respond to it.  I gave up.",0
As Advertised.  Received timely,1
"This product did not work.  It ran two or three times, but then stopped.  We changed the battery several times, adjusted the collar on the cat several times, but still no luck.  We finally purchased a wireless bell that kept the cat away from the pet door.  We also tried to return this product, but because we did not return within their allotted time (I think 3 months), no response from the seller.  Don't waste your money.",0
Takes several to get the job done...even when there is not much to clean.,0
I really love how my 8 gallon BiOrb looks with these two plants added.  Right now I only have one (spoiled) Beta in the tank.  He loves the large leaves of the solid green plant and has made one of the leaves his new place to sleep when the lights go to moonlight.  These are a perfect fit for an 8 gallon tank.,1
Super cute! They seem very sturdy and won't fall apart easily. The sad thing is they don't fit my little Yorkie.  :(,1
"I would not consider this the ""world's best"" for cat litter.  It didn't perform any better than any of the other cat litter that I have tried for my finicky cat.  However, it might win an award for ""world's best spare paint in can absorber"" as it fulfilled double duty when disposing of old latex paint.  The litter dried up the excess paint very quickly, suitable enough for disposal in the local landfill.",0
Love this food for my dogs. The larger size works best for the three.,1
Didn't last fell apart within a week losing big pieces at a time had to keep an eye on it and my dog the whole week it lasted,0
This works well and was On time and as promised,1
"Wow! The horse (not mine) hasn't been taken care of in years. I ordered this, put it into the horse's eyes (not an easy feat), and was taken aback by what came out!! Using plain water, I read, dries the animal's eyes, and he has enough problems! Anyway, Thank you!",1
"Amazing product! I am so happy my fish are now swimming in clean, clear water. Thank you!",1
Cheap and the steps are too narrow.  I would not advise  anyone to purchase.,0
"Purchased for my 2 dogs 4 weeks ago,1 -16 week old  puppy and the other is 2 years old. Both have very loose stool and excessive thirst. So I know it's the food ! Probably allot of salt. High in calories. I really believe it gets good reviews for the cheap price.
Update; Switched to Fromms, puppy and gold for the older dog. WOW ! Perfect stool, no more excessive thirst and  even noticed no more itching. My local pet store is 25% less $$ than Amazon, on all dog food.",0
"I was not a big fan of this, used it for a month and it did not help at all. The vet even suggested it.",0
"This dog bed is terrible. The foam inside just falls apart when you take off the cover to wash. Plus when I first took off the cover to wash, the foam inside was covered with hair. Don't buy this one",0
3.5 to 4 stars the dogs liked the peanut butter center but not the bone. I use the bones and put peanut butter inside em. Not something id buy again jsut because the dogs won't eat the bone. Otherwise its great,1
I'm not certain this is the real thing. It did not work as well as the Frontline Plus purchased from the petstore.,0
Yummy yum. Says the dog,1
"I like this a lot. The pink is cute, it works well and the handle is comfortable.

Only thing to remember is that the pink will get a little dirty so you may want to scotchgaurd it.",1
Pump was broken  when it arrived. Never got to use it,0
This bed lasted 48 hours before being torn apart by my lab.,0
"Good quality blade, holds a good edge and works well without too much drag.",1
"Did not fit, to small.",0
"Great little tool, I have a Cubic20 and it makes it easy to clean the take. I find it has enough control to shut it off and and not hurt the jellies. Even the tank servicing company liked it.

I use it with salt water which it says fresh only. So not expecting a real long life. But so far so well and have no complaints. Which is pretty rare for me :)",1
work well;very affordable,1
Fun toy squeaks great,1
"have a concern here... it seems the 8 oz. package ( blue coloring with clouds on the package) is labeled and marketed as made in USA.  If you should decide as I did wow great product but a bit pricey for such a small amount, let me get a larger size - perhaps one of the canisters... then you are then buying a foreign product literally.  Again the larger quantity packages and even the small quantity in a canister is not made and produced solely in the USA.  You can see for yourself on the company website.  I find that somewhat although not totally deceptive.  They do mention this but unless reading very carefully marketed to be subtle.  That troubles me.  Not sure if they would be deceptive in other areas too which is why I won't purchase this item again.  Buyer beware!  Hope this helps someone as our pets need us to decipher the ""fine print"".  For those concerned about products from outside the USA read the label of the actual product purchased.  It must say made USA.",0
Absolutely fantastic product! The material is just as high quality of a hoodie i would buy. I bought an 8 XL for my 105 lb Cane Corso and he loves it.,1
"This is a great product, but the price is what got me. This is very reasonable for how much you get, as long as the price stays like this, i will keep buying! Thanks",1
It totally works.  She's eating much more slowly and it has cut back on her wheezing episodes.,1
Not working  good,0
This collar arrived sooner than expected. The lettering is perfect. The reflective material on the collar helps when walking my dog in the dark.,1
"My dog always wears a seatbelt/harness in the car to keep her safe in a collision. After less than 4 months, the back buckle started to comle undone on its own. Not sure when it started to fail and I never would have known it was defective during a crash. Also, the padding is bulky and is twisting and it fits oddly. It loosens easily and doesn't seem safe. Disappointing. We quit using it and now only use our older one and are looking into more rigorously tested harnesses for the car.",0
love this stroller,1
Don't waste your money.,0
I tried using my product and the bulb would not emmit any heat.  I tried to different fixtures and none of them worked.,0
I did not hesitate to buy this since I bought one about three years ago. The quality of the newest model is no where near the quality of the older one. The canvas seems very tight so I am hoping this one lasts and does not begin to come apart.,0
"My cats are not interested in this item at al. Darn picky felines. Sorry, I can not recommend this product.",0
Did not do the job,0
My pigeons love it. Except I wish some of the pebbles were smaller.,1
Difficult to find a hose and attachment that work with it.,0
These were expired when I got them,0
Perfect size and quality,1
I didn't buy these on Amazon but I'm writing this review to warn others about this product. I've been giving my dog these peanut butter dog treats for about 3 months. Since I started giving her them she has been having bloody diarrhea off and on. I couldn't figure out what was causing it until I noticed that every time I gave her one of the treats she would have the diarrhea again. Thank goodness I realized what was causing it and stopped giving her the dog treats. I'm not sure if she is just sensitive to one of the ingredients but I do see other reviews on here about the dog treats making their dog sick also.,0
Good for our dog with sensitive tummy,1
My dog won first place thanks so much,1
Great quality and really cute!!!,1
Sorry but this absolutely does not work. My dog just gets startled by everything. Blood work and exams by the doctor showed nothing is wrong with her so I thought I'd give this a try. It had no effect on her constant screams for no reason. She even gets startled by the sound of someone getting stepping on dried leaves.,0
"My 2nd time buying and I am not happy at all with the changes made! The entire leash is ribbon width so when its at full length, it folds and then won't retract.  Bad idea folks!! Go back to the original style!",0
"These suck. They arrived dull. I tried to clip my cat's claw and it crushed the claw because it was so dull. (I tried only at the tip of the claw, so the cat was fine.) The blades are too close together to sharpen easily. I wanted to return it, but I had thrown away the packaging (stupid!). My old ones that I've used for over 10 years was sharper than these.

I found a Youtube video of a lady using a thin chain saw file to sharpen pet nail clippers. Found a skinny file that fit in my old clippers, so that's what I do. These serve as...colorful decoration? And an annoying reminder to not throw away the packaging.",0
This item started to come apart about a week after I got it. The Velcro loop at the top fell apart after very light use. Would not buy again.,0
"I cut each chew up and hide it in a Greenies Pill Pocket. Our yorkie is not a fan of the flavor, but I AM a fan of it's good ingredients.",1
"Impulse buy on an Amazon deal, not sure if it would help with my 6 month old cockapoo.
I put it on vibrate on a SUPER LOW setting, and broke him of barking when he is put in his kennel for bed the first night (we used to let him bark it out for a half an hour before he quieted and went to sleep!)
 If he is supposed to be doing his business and gets distracted I give him a 2 on vibration, and he comes running back to the house. I haven't been able to break him of running to see the neighbors if they are out when he is unattended in the yard yet, but they give him so much positive reinforcement when they see him, and he is out of range so fast, I will have to work on it...maybe use a real shock when he is a little older. For now, I LOVE THIS THING!!

Update: IT started failing occasionally, after about 40 days, now at 70ish days it won't pair with transmitter at all, even when re-set.
Still gave it 2 stars as it was great while it lasted...",0
It just arrived and it is missing the MOST important piece...the ball! Now it's just some disk with a small scratch pad in the center. I hate making returns so sadly I'll have to see if I have a ball that will fit. I wish the could just send me a ball so I wouldn't have to return the whole thing! My cats are sad. Such a disappointing day!,0
"Feline Caviar was recently changed in shape and ingredients. Our cat loved the old version and became and remained vibrantly healthy, but she dislikes the new version (she hardly eats). We will continue for a few more days supplying only this food, but, sadly (the food is incredibly good for our/your cat) we'll have to change to another brand.",0
Killed fleas quickly on our 2 cats! No adverse reactions.,1
When put with the pressure mounted gate it was not stable. If pushed or pulled on the whole thing would fall down.,0
Mine came broken into three pieces. Looked cute but very small. I like my dog to have a larger water bowl.,0
Product looked fine I didn't measure good so its too narrow,1
Puppy will use this one.,1
Not as nice as the old design with the stiffer wire.  The wire frays quickly and the toy becomes unsafe.  Disappointing.,0
"Not really convinced that it works against fleas since our dogs still host flea circuses. Purchased the shampoo, wipes and two bottles of spray and really have not seen the benefits.",0
"I've had one of these mid-size docks for my smaller turtle for a couple of years. The suction cups are totally useless, so I rigged up a way to secure it without them.  After a couple of years the underside of the thing started crumbling. I've wondered if the foam stuff that breaks off is toxic to my turtle, so I keep it out of the tank, but everytime I clean it, more falls off. Call it the ""disappearing turtle dock"".  Makes me re-think Zoo Med products altogether, because these are not cheap, but they are made cheaply.",0
They ran big.,0
Love this product. Easy and quick assembly. And easy to store back in the bags. That's huge for me.,1
Right out of the box the pump failed to pump the water even tho the pump was marked as having passed quality control. Opened up pump and found it only had 3 of the 4 necessary parts.,0
My dogs love these! They don't smell and they keep them busy for hours. I'm a repeat buyer.,1
"My dog received this for a Christmas gift. He uses it everyday. I live in Phoenix, AZ. Our winters are mild but do not want my dog lying on the cold concrete plus our summers are scorchers and I want to keep him up off the boiling concrete then too. This bed is great for all year round pooch comfort. It was simple to put together. I saw other reviews prior to ordering that stated assembly was difficult. I did not find this to be the case at all. Fido LOVES it. I like the 5 year warranty on the fabric....it is a win win.",1
Hard to get the bottle off,0
"Did not stay upright for even one feeding - granted my cats approach any food like starving rhinos.  It make a cute whatnot tray.  Instead, I found the Wetnoz Arch dish was sturdier and cannot be tipped over.  Now, If I could only get the cats to stop knocking me over before I get the dishes down....",0
"I had read the reviews and thought this would be a great option to solve my problems of a smoke colored dog door the dogs wouldn't use. I was familiar with air curtains etc, so felt this would be a great option. The problem was that to begin with, the plastic obviously isn't rated to stay flexible during cold weather. It would curl and remain in that shape if it was cold. The second problem was that the strips are just cut and placed along side each other instead of overlapping like most plastic flap doors do. Therefore between the curling plastic and the openings which are never completely closed this door flap is totally worthless. It lets in nearly as much air as no curtain at all.
The only plus is that the price was lower than most... but obviously there is a reason for that.",0
I am completely satisfied with this cat tower. Well worth the money,1
Not at all effective on an 18LBS terrier. Collar holds about 5 sprays worth of citronella (or doesn't fill correctly). Would not recommend.,0
excellent seller . Excellent wares,1
"It does the awful job it's supposed to.

My only complaint is that the handles spread so wide I have trouble clamping down one-handed. And of course, you need both hands for the job you're doing. So due to the wide-spread handles, an unpleasant job takes a bit longer than I'd like it to.",1
Our little indoor rabbit LOVES his spacious new home!  This is great & easy to clean.  Great buy!  Good price.  Thank you,1
"I ordered two size large and this one is way too tight in comparison to the other one, they both are Zack & Zoey...",0
Great price for a great leash,1
"Great cage!
Our two Guinea pigs love it!
Very spacious.

We cut a piece of corrugated plastic the size of the bottom and fold our fleece bedding and towels layer under. Keeps them from burrowing the bedding out. Makes for very easy clean up.

We bought a hand vac (with nozzle attachment) and designated it for the cage for easy, everyday cleaning.",1
"THey were hard as rocks and my dog would not eat them! I bought 7 bags of them! They did not mention they were
going to so hard and they were called Chewy Buns Rawhide rolls!",0
My dogs love these!,1
"Our 7-8 year old cat developed a food allergy or a protein deficiency the last 2-3 years. After numerous vet treatments(actually years of mistreatment)that were always anti-biotics, I moved her to another vet clinic with a better reputation. They used a treatment plan of a different drug over a 2 or 3 month time period and it also failed. They had no idea what was wrong and suggested I take the cat to Ohio State for treatment at their Vet School. No I'm not making this up! After spending a full day and $600 ,I was told everything tested negative and to try this Hills hypoallergenic food. I had little confidence that this would work but after 2 days I could tell the cat was feeling better. Wow- After all these years I have found my cats problem. I have tried one bag of this food and must say it is working out fine as I am afraid to take her completely off the Hill's rabbit/pea formula. Since there are so many positive reviews I may use more of this until eventually the overpriced Hill's is
eliminated. I will update my review as I continue to increase the Nat. Bal. food. Thank you for the insight on this product.

11/8/13 Here is an update to my above review. This food continues to serve my cat well and although I am still using about one third of the Hill's rabbit/pea formula , I feel in the future I will still eliminate the more expensive Hill's.",1
My dog absolutely loves these. He gets almost one every other day and after 6 months he's still not sick of them,1
"For the price, I was honestly expecting low quality, but it's fenomenal! Reaches to my 9 foot ceiling and is extremely study.  There isn't a lot of room for the hanging swing, for my bigger car, so I left it off, but other than that we both love it!",1
Unfortunately this did not work.,0
Was a Christmas Present for my Boxer. He is really enjoying it and so far it has made it threw a full day! ,1
"I had purchased a strap harness for my young cat hoping to get him used to it so I could take him camping. While he was good about putting it on he wouldn't move once he was buckled in. With this vest harness he walks on a leash and explores. There is no resistance about putting it on (I do still try to remember to give him a treat when I put it on) and he'll wear it for several hours. My cat (perhaps because I did start him young) isn't bothered by the noise of the velcro.
My cat weighs about 11 pounds now and the small/medium is still a good fit (be sure you can get at least 2 fingers in the collar as well as around the midsection).",1
Bypass this.,0
"It works well, but only if you modify it so that your cat will not reach in and grab the food out. I screwed on a shield made from some plastic that I cut and now it works fine. For how expensive it is I should not have to have modded it. It would have been very easy for the to change the bowl design to prevent this. Otherwise so far it's working fine.",0
"Terrible. I bought the right size (small for up to 45lbs) for my dog(28lb mini schnauzer) and  my main concern was that he was going to bite them off since he doesn't love wearing things. Crazy thing is, he didn't. I was super excited because he's getting old and slips on hardwood, not to mention his nails make the most annoying ""pitter-patter"" noise when he walks. But after 20 minutes of normal walking around the room, they started to fall off and eventually did. This really disappointing. I should have just bough Infant socks. They only cost a couple of bucks. And would fall off just as easily.",0
"I have to keep my dog in the ""cone of shame"" for a while and the old, plastic e-collar was just so obnoxious.  He would knock over potted plants and bump into everything - not to mention it had to be so uncomfortable.  He will have to wear a cone for a while because he is scratching at his neck until it is raw.  I found this soft-sided comfort cone and it has worked out great!  His only issue is protecting the neck so I can fold back the edge of the cone and he can see better, and can eat and drink with it on.  I also purchased a bigger doggy door and he can get in and out as he needs to with no problem even with the cone on.  Great product!!",1
I have been ordering these for the past 9 months and haven't had an issue; they have always been odor free. I re-order these every several months and have been satisfied up until now. This last batch we received was NOT odor-free as advertised. I opened the package and the smell was just horrible; it smelled like something died in the package. The only place the packaging says the product is odor-free is on the sticker that the company sticks onto it. I do not recommend and I will be requesting a refund.,0
We used this on our dog. It helped his situation out.,1
"Had these for about a month, the goats got them filthy, so I put them in the washingmachine and the insides are just breaking off and falling apart. Apparently they are not machine washable. Rinsing them with a hose will not get goat poop off of them or any other poop. wasted money on these",0
"My dogs really enjoyed these, I order toys and treats for our dogs quite often, and have never been disappointed.",1
"These are a life saver! When my dog became incontinent I didn't know how I was going to handle it. Then I came across these on amazon. I order 1 package just to try them out and immediately ordered more. Everything stays in the diaper, there's no leakage and the urine is wicked away, keeping my dog dry.",1
DO NOT USE THIS. IT IS KILLING ANIMALS!!!,0
"Horrible!!!!  If you have a sensitive sniffer, the PERFUME smell is nauseating!!I have used the regular Nature's Miracle for years and found it to be a good and reliable product.  However, as our cat is much older and having some issues, decided to try this particular product especially formulated for cat urine.  I'm not sure which is worse, the cat odor smell or the very strong perfume smell of this product after applying it almost 2 weeks ago.  The perfume smell still permeates through the entire house.",0
my rott mix ripped this up in no time.  hard to find a sturdy toy for large breeds:(,0
"I love these Kong scratchers. I have MANY cats and they tear them to pieces, esp. after using the litterbox!! It must be a statement!! Anyway I highly recommend these, they are great!!",1
"I purchased the Blue Buffalo dog food on August 2nd, but unfortunately was not able to feed more than a few cups to my dogs. One of my dogs refused to eat it, and the other dog was made violently ill with over a week of extreme and constant diarrhea. The only thing that stopped his stomach issues was to stop feeding him the kibble, and when I thought his stomach was better, I gave him a very small amount to try it out. He was immediately sick to his stomach again. There is obviously something wrong with this food. After reading the other 1 star reviews of this product, and comparing the multiple testimonials to my own pet's truly terrifying experience, I no longer feel safe purchasing dog food from Amazon - there isn't enough quality control and nowhere to place responsibility.",0
Broke within 1 week of use. Not worth the money,0
"Great product, I had read the package insert wrong at first, seems like this product will work well for my salt water aquarium.  thanks fluval",1
"I would NEVER recommend this K9 Advantix II to anyone.
I used this product as instructed - my puppy weighs 7 lbs.
It was no more effective than putting water on my dog's back.
Waste of money!
Now I have to search for another product.",0
Good,1
"It's all very well and good for the loop to be made of plastic coated cable. That's something I really need for dogs that gator roll and bite the loop. However, the plastic sliding piece does not lock at all into place and just slides open so a dog can easily get out of the loop. It's pretty much useless.",0
"My cat ate the first one, but she won't go near it again. Even if we crumble it up in food, she either eats around the crumbles or ignores the food altogether.  I don't usually find my cat to be finicky, but in this case, she is.",0
"When I opened the box, the collar device was already charged and not in plastic.  It was obvious that it was already taken out of the packaging and used in some fashion.  Also, the package did not come with a battery tester or pins to use on the collar device.  This is the third and last device I am buying from Pet Trainer.  While it does do the job effectively when it works, the problem is that it does not work very long.  Time to move on.  Amazon - whats up wit the used device that was opened?",0
contains rosemary extract ... never again,0
"I love them cause my dog, Miniature Schnauzer, loves them. The first thing when I wake up she is there waiting, and that makes me happy. No artificial colors, ingredients, or smells, just pure USA Chicken. For anyone wondering these are the same as the ones they carry at SAMS. Since we only go there once a month, it's nice to know I can have them shipped 2 days and my Boo Boo will never run out.",1
I bought this to train my dog from pulling and it broke immediately once my dog started to pull. Horrible and cheap product.,0
"Groomer said this was a great product.  One of my dogs was having dry flaky spots that itched.  I think this is helping with the itching but do not think it heals.  Groomer mentioned the same brand shampoo for dermatitis.  So since I got the oatmeal shampoo - I may end up also
getting this other.  Will see how all of it works first with Wham and oatmeal shampoo. I will mention my vet said to put vinegar on the flaky spots and it helped a lot with the flaking and dryness.",1
My puppy did not cuddle or love this. He ate it. What a waste.,0
Great. Love it!,1
Stops most of litter on their paws from going out into the hall.,1
This car seat cover is high quality and functions very well. The 'hammock feature keeps my dog safe and comfortable in her back seat place. Recommend this product without any reservations.,1
"My dog developed a skin issue.  I could not figure it out.  He at the same food and never a problem. After getting an ear infection and scabs on his skin, $600 dollars later from the Vet with no answers, I talked to a person who suggested to try this food.  After 2 weeks of eating this food his skin cleared up, his stink went away.  No more itching........  WELL WORTH IT!!",1
Center plug came loose and the pink bit got stuck on my dog's lower jaw causing great pain and trip to emergency vet to remove it.,0
Love it!,1
"It works so freeeaking well. It takes the smell away every single time. Sometime I need to use more than one application on a spot, but that's not a problem for me. As long as the spots gone! Our cats have been marking our Christmas tree, so we sprayed it with this and the smell is completely gone, you could never tell. I will be buying this again.",1
Loosen up on there own. Very ineffective,0
Not bag shown and two different bags. My dog doesn't like them so going back,0
"I am sorry to say this product didn't work as advertised.  We wanted it to work so much that we tried troubleshooting steps several times over a few days, but it just wouldn't disperse the food.  It would get stuck or if it did disperse food it wouldn't cycle to the next feeding time.  In the end, we just couldn't rely on it to feed our animals so we returned it.",0
"A little difficult to remove the different heads, but it's an awesome tool!",1
Best way to shop :),1
"Makes a weird, loud chirping noise when on.  Is just as annoying as the barking dog.",0
Our new rescue kitten LOVES this!  especially when he gets in one of those crazy moods and goes running through the house - he stops and plays on his cat tree and just has a ball!  I highly recommend this - and I also put it together!  It comes with very detailed instructions and tool and was quite easy to assemble  :),1
"I need to add this to my review I wrote before.  The cat food is fine,  but Amazon can't meet it's obligations to send it when you subscribe to Auto Ship!  Two months now it's 'not in stock' and I have to go out and buy it.  And if I didn't check my account I wouldn't even know.  No notice that my cat food isn't coming.  NOT cool, Amazon.  Don't get too big, customer service is your bread and butter.  Take better care of loyal repeat customers.  Here is my first review where I gave it 5 stars.......I have 5 picky cats and for once, I found a food they ALL will eat!  I like that it's not full of nasty stuff like byproducts and animal innerds.  it's guilt free to feed to my darlings.  And the price is very good, too.  Nothing else to say, it's good, healthy food for them and they EAT it.  I'm happy with it and I have the auto-delivery so I won't run out of it.  Thanks, Amazon.",0
Did not help with anxiety,0
I thought this would work for our two Maltipoo pups with unfortunately it didn't.,0
"I love Fizzion. It is the only product that I've used so far, that will remove the pet odors. In addition, it doesn't destroy fabrics or leather, like other products have.",1
"Nice as an odor remover, worthless as spraying deterrent. Cats keep going back to the very same spot. We have tried this product over and over, same results. Hope you have better luck.",0
Dog loves his bed but replacement covers are not the same quality as original covers and don't last . Original lasted 18 months and since then every replacement cover lasts about 3 months. Why can't this company offer replacement covers of the same quality ? I'd rather spend more to get better quality.  I hate the bait and switch technique this company uses to deceive us.,0
"I bought this for my German shepherd puppy who is terrified of water. first of all, she didn't even float with it. if she stopped swimming, she would start to sink. and yes, I bought the correct size. then, she barely pulled on the d ring for leash attachment and it broke immediately and the handle started coming off. this is incredibly poor quality. the only good thing I have to say is that it is lightweight and cute. this was purchased on my mom's Amazon account because she has prime",0
"I got the brown collar that fits 16"" to 20"" necks. Our older dog is allergic to all collars we have ever tried on her except leather ones. This collar is very well constructed with a metal buckle that is riveted in place. It has several holes to adjust the collar as needed. Our older dog looks very nice in this collar and now I have no worries that she will break out. Leather is very durable and strong. I feel this collar will last for years to come. She looks very nice in her collar (see pic) and we would recommend this collar to anyone with a medium to large dog.
* I received this product at a discount or free for my written review. My opinion may differ from your own.*",1
"First of all my dog loves them.  Secondly, he hasn't had a problem limping around since he started them on a daily basis.  My dog broke his leg as a puppy and has a pin in it.  So far so good.",1
I like the idea of this but it doesn't quite work. The bottom tray isn't big enough and the cat food would hit it and bounce out all over the floor. My cat wasn't a big fan of it either. I ended up giving it away.,0
Strong material and that's important for this type of product.,1
I was encouraged by others reviews of this product but sadly it's had no effect on my dog.  He is still very anxious.  I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true.,0
Works great. Turtles are happy. Hopefully it lasts (had it for almost 2 months).,1
Inaccurate by 2-6 degrees F,0
"Awami Outdoor Dog Raincoat is cute as a button and made very well. Sadly, my puppy grew more while waiting for the raincoat to arrive. I definitely feel like this raincoat is made for small to medium dogs, a growing lab is kinda big for it. I was able to give it to my neighbor that has a smaller dog and the dog loves wearing it. They walk all the time, day or night, rain or shine.  Don't get me wrong, I love this raincoat, and will be ordering the next size for my own dog. My suggestion is that you definitely review the sizes and order a size up.
I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review",1
"Very quiet, has smarts so it knows when it is running dry and shuts down. Easily controlled flow. There is nothing I don't like about this pump.

5 months later the pump is trash. Was having issues restarting from feed mode so I cleaned to buildup in vinegar. No way it wasn't clean and would not restart 1 in 5 times. Then it just quit in the middle of the night for no reason and I could not get it to restart after hours of messing with it in the sink. All that's left to do is throw it away. Read reviews of people who have had this a while. The DCT line is very unreliable. Maybe the DCP line is better but all these Chinese pumps are made cheap.",0
Delivery was fast and the brush performed as advertised. The cat obviously enjoys the brushing and her coat is nice and shiny afterward. With the push of a button any fur and debris is removed.,1
nice,1
"do not put a live fish in this tiny bit of water. if you really like the shape, buy some flowers and forgo the fish. unless you like torturing small animals you should really stay away from something this small.",0
"My two rescue kittens love this food. They weren't crazy for Kitten Chow. I'm not crazy about all the fillers in that one either. Hence, I purchased this one. Even my 21 year Princess (who isn't supposed to eat it,sneaked  it now and then until I moved it out of her reach) loves it.
Because it is mostly chicken and chicken meal by-products and not chicken by products and no strange fillers and colors, I highly recommend this for your kittens. The adult cat food in this line is great too.",1
Cats come running for treats,1
dogs love them,1
Terrible!... It Makes your water cloudier and it makes the filter filthy. Dont trust the good reviews.,0
"Not up to Jolly Pet standards.  I'm a huge fan of Jolly products.  This is the first one that's junk.  Made in China unlike any other product I have from them.  My own fault for not verifying first.
My dog put holes in the monkey's face with one bite in the first 5 seconds with the toy.  Whatever stuffing inside was exposed so end of toy.  Definitely a good concept and my dog loved it....if they can fix the durability....",0
"These leashes look and feel the part but after 12 hours and only being hooked up to my 30 pound puppy a handful of times, the stitching is already coming undone.  I gave it two stars because the second one is perfectly fine.  I don't know if one was defective or if the quality is that low.",0
This is by far the best carrier I have ever owned! My dog fit perfectly in there and was very comfortable throughout my 3 day road trip.,1
"Five star all the way. From skunks on the dog, to stains on your clothes.",1
Very sturdy and perfect for my 11 lb Maltese....he learned it first day... A great relief as he just had tplo surgery and we don't want him to jump. The stair treads are wide and deep enough so that he isn't afraid to use them like the last steps we had. Great purchase!,1
"Cat doesn't like them, gave them to a friend.",0
Neither cat liked these.,0
We have bought these balls multiple times for our labrador. Pretty sure we got a bad batch as all four balls have ripped in half with in one use. Our dog is not an aggressive chewer. These balls usually last us months- really disappointed.,0
"I love this harness! It looks nice and it doesn't choke my dogs no matter how hard they pull, unlike all other harnesses I've tried in the past. I've machine washed it several times and it still looks good. Another benefit to the ring being further back is that two of my Dachshunds use a wheelchair and it doesn't interfere with the yoke of the wheelchair that goes on their shoulders. My Dachshunds weigh between 14-20 pounds and they all use the Large size.",1
"It's only a piece of paper glued to a cheap piece of fiber board.  Hell, the paper wasn't even cut straight when glued to the board.  Was to be a gift, but I'd be embarrassed to give it away.",0
"The pump for the water filter is not strong enough. The water gets so gross so very fast because of the lack of water flow.  Tried working with the power of the flow.  Still no luck.  I read the reviews, but did not heed them. Now wishing I would have.  Still considering putting a stronger pump in.",0
Really like it and just as pictured.  Super cute on my baby!,1
Little pricey but delivered on time and cats love it.,1
"DO NOT take the chance with this defective medication! Danger to your Pet.
My Pomeranian almost died from Seizures and Low Temp/Heartrate within hours of application and needed late night emergency care at the Vets, which Merial, the manufacturer, paid for without so much as a whimper. WHAT DOES THAT SAY?????

Also my Pom now has PERMANENT DAMAGE to her Thyroid, Pre Certifect was a typical pom PUFFBALL, now, even on Thyroid meds, she shows the CLASSIC HYPOTHYROID HAIR LOSS PATTERN and we are working on getting her blood levels up to a satisfactory point. PERMANENT depressive emotional changes, 6 months out from this poison. My happy Pom is just sort of there now. No more stuffed toys, looks down when I call her and comes slowly like I am going to get mad at her. Breaks my heart.

CERTIFECT POISONED MY LITTLE BUDDY WHEN I WAS TRYING TO HELP HER AVOID ANOTHER TICK DISEASE> DON'T let your vet push you into this dangerous Russian Roulette with your pet. JUST THE HORRIBLE SMELL would keep me from ever using this WITHOUT the LIFE THREATENING and LIFE ALTERING damages this poison can cause. Please Google around and see for yourself what a horrible risk you take using this GARBAGE.

Merial should be forced to remove this product from the market and owners affected should be compensated for ANY issues post certifect.

The Tick active ingrediant here is Amitraz combined with an older drug Fiprinil( spelling may be off) and STINKY OLD CITRONELLA OIL.
Amitraz combined with these other two agents was never tested completely, although each has been tested seperately. Just throw three things together and dump it on the market, it should be OK., seems to be the reasoning here, like a little Doggie Speedball Dope.

This product sucks, the company sucks for putting our pets at risk like this. STAY AWAY if you love your animals.",0
Just what I needed and works well. Great for using with treat training.,1
Way too small,0
"Even Machine Washing cannot help these look clean.  Hair get caught all up in them within a matter of days and you can try everything in the book to get the hair out and you cannot.  I tried vacuuming, picking, tape, and machine washing.  Nothing works.  And, after you machine wash them twice, you may as well throw them away (that is what I did) because they are now falling apart.  Stuffing coming out of them at this point.  Definitely not worth the price.",0
"Yang, my Balinese-Siamese rescue, was eating poorly and throwing up right after eating his canned food in the morning. Once a day I mix the probiotic in his middle of the day meal. After a month or so, no more problems. He is gaining weight and eating well. The other four want some of it too, but they don't really need it and the cost is a factor.",1
This is the only food my cats will eat! They love it and I order this product on a regular basis and have never had any issues with shipping or the product.,1
Love it,1
"One star is being quite generous...  The idea behind this is great -- but the shape is just wrong for every litter box I could find (aside from the really small, shallow ones for kittens) -- it just isn't deep enough.  I ended up buying a small dishpan to use, and it just barely fits -- my goal was to have the cat get out of the litterbox inside, so that litter wouldn't end up all over the floor. This is next to impossible.  And I fortunately listened to other reviews suggesting that the furniture piece be lined with contact paper before using, because if you have a cat over 5 pounds, there just isn't enough room for them, and they are constantly peeing over the edge of the litter box.  So great idea, but poor design.  Assembly was okay -- we found that some of the screws didn't go in straight, and ended up poking through the cheap wood side pieces. I would NOT recommend this item for a cat, and there is NO ventilation, and the ammonia smell burns my eyes (even after we clean up the ""misses"" -- can only imagine what our poor cats thought.  Back to the old style of boxes for us.",0
"My dogs are both pretty aggressive chewers, especially my border collie, who always needs something to keep him occupied. The scent of the bone attracted them immediately and they haven't let it out of their sight since I gave it to them. It seems to be lasting very well, considering how hard they're working at it. There's no chipping or bone shards and the shape allows them to get a good grip. I may have to get another one because they don't seem very happy about sharing.",1
"Cat loves it, well made. Zero issues.",1
"After spraying at first the product on the surfaces my puppy likes to chew the most, it didn't take. As a matter of fact, it looked like he actually liked it.... So, I decided to send it back.

Kevin from Emy's Best contacted me to ask for the reason of returning the product (he said right away that they will refund me the money, but since they are a small company they want all the feedbacks, so to make their product better). I told him the story and then said that maybe I should have sprayed more and not to be so quick to return it (by then I noticed the puppy completely stopped chewing on one of the doors he loved so much and where I sprayed more than on anything else). Kevin offered to ship the product back to me for no additional charge, which was very nice of him and he didn't have to do it, but he did.

After getting the spray, this time I sprayed much more on every object again and .... 3 days in the puppy hasn't touched any of them! He found other places..., but it is now easily fixed with Emy's Best Pet Chew & Scratch Deterrent ;-)",1
"One of my dogs loves it and the other runs away lol! The camera quality is actually really good; both normal and night vision. There was a minor issue when it disconnected from my WiFi and wouldnt reconnect, but I left it off overnight and it worked perfect again in the morning with no issues since.",1
"We have five large dogs.  Size of toys is always imperative.  The size quoted in the description is, in one place 13 inches and in another 12.99 inches for length.  This toy is actually only 10 inches in length and appropriate for a smaller dog.  At first, I assumed perhaps a small toy had gotten attached to the packaging for a large, but on checking measurements for the small size, it doesn't match.  It's way smaller than it's supposed to be and for a large to medium dog, would be flimsy.  My dogs weigh 54 pounds and it's too small for them.  I cannot recommend something which doesn't meet the size of the description by such a great amount.  I have contacted Amazon.com regarding this.  The toy is going back.  By the time you read the description, it's possible that description will have been corrected.",0
Liked at first but charging connection fell apart at collar two small wires broke,0
"This has been the best thing for my two fur children to ride in and keep my car clean. I would love to give 5 starts, however the poles broke through and I had to tape to keep it together.  It is like a pop up tent that fits perfectly in my back seat. My two terriers love riding in it during our long road trips",1
Our dog's favorite!!,1
The latest bag of rawhide rolls don't last as long as previous rolls from the same company. They appear to be smaller and not as thick.,0
This is one of the best items we have purchased!  It was easy to install and the cats love it!  Now their cat room door can be closed and they can come and go as they please.  GREAT for indoors!!!!!!!!,1
"I absolutely hated this product and hope no one has the same experience.  I'm used to loving all of my purchases from Amazon, so it's really rare that I'd write a poor review on anything.  My husband and I had to be mostly out of town for two months, stopping in to see our cats a few times a week.  I thought the Le Bistro feeder did a good job at feeding them although, I noticed my cats weight seem to fluctuate from week to week (too skinny after the first week, too fat when I added an extra meal).  I figured it was okay that the portions couldn't be fine tuned a bit more to keep the cats from gaining weight, at least they were happy and fed.  When we got back to our usual routine back at home with the feeder and cats, we were so disappointed to see that the size of the meals were extremely inconsistent.  Most meals released about two teaspoons of food, not the 1/4 cup it was programmed for.  Then finally, after eight weeks of using the feeder we witnessed that it did not dole out the food at the preset times at all, it was feeding the cats completely sporadically, sometimes five times in ten minutes, sometimes in 45 minutes, not the 6 hours apart we had timed at all.

Amazon doesn't honor returns as a usual practice after 30 days are up, but at least after talking to customer service and telling them I received a faulty product that broke after 60 days they sent me a special return with a prepaid UPS label.

I lost $10 to $15 on this faulty product with a partial refund, but I chalk it up to learning and feeding the cats at least for the 6 weeks we were out of town.

I'm still looking for that dream feeder that offers portion control and allows us to sleep in.",0
Helps and both dogs like to be brushed with it,1
"Good product.  My 15lb dauchsund fit nicely.  After adjusting to being harnessed in he did great.  We make a 2 1/2 hour drive every 5 weeks, this product has helped tremendously.",1
"I really didn't like these and neither did Jack Jr.  He climbed up and checked it out exactly once and found that there was really no place to stand up there.... so it doesn't make a very good lookout tower.  The only way we are able to use them is if I turn them on their sides but the habitrail ovo dens are really better for that by far and about the same price.  unfortunately I ordered three of them - I may keep them around in case I decide to jerryrig a cage to accept tubes - the part that keeps accepts the tube could in theory be joined with silicone or some other adhesive to an opening cut into something else and then tubes could be attached to it.  But other than that, kinda useless...",0
Smells good. Dog likes it.,1
"I ordered 2 different sizes and while the larger one fit my 18lb beagle, I had to cut the arms out as they were too tight around her. Overall, it's definitely just a fashion piece, not meant for any warmth.. but it's cute and looks very much like it is pictured. It is definitely more of a black or VERY VERY dark blue with brighter blue accents and not nearly as blue as the pictures on the dog as shown. Overall, happy with purchase and seems to be holding up well",1
My kitty loves these things. He can hear the sound of the shaking from another room and comes trotting in. Resealable top keeps them fresh and crunchy. This is one of the few treats he never tires of.,1
I have two birds and both really like this food. I will use it again.,1
"... After making the mistake and trusting the title and the review that claims to have contaced Kong:

""Thank you for contacting Consumer Relations,

We thank you for your interest in our Kong products.  The treats that you saw advertised as ""KONG Premium Treats Sweet Potato Vegan Treats"" are not Vegan.  It appears that some retailers and websites take some liberties and call them Vegan because they do have a meat listed in the ingredients. The Gelatin is porcine, which actually comes from pork.

We now offer Kong Sweet Potato Chews at PetSmart which are 100% Sweet Potatoes sliced and dried. These treats are Vegan and available in a 10oz bag. ""

I have since passed the non vegan ones onto a friend's dog, who likes them.",0
Had to remove from tank. It kept clogging the filter.,0
"My dog began having trouble jumping.  We gave her these and it went away.  After a year of one tab a day, she got the pain when jumping again so now I give her two tabs and the pain is gone.  We've now been using this product a year and a half.",1
Wife wears daily,1
Nice treat pouch that works well and is a good value. I would highly recommend this,1
My dog chews then in 5 minutes. Not very durable.,0
Our dogs love their door. Began using it immediately. Used lumber to fortify the bottom and sides but is holding up well with two German Shepherds.,1
"I was examining images of this cage online, and initially thought it might be durable because of its metal construction, and inability to be chewed by its inhabitants. Though I have not actually purchased the cage, it struck me that with a hamster's poor eyesight, the height of its third level loft could cause injury to the animal, should it accidentally misstep and tumble the full height of the cage.",0
Ordered this for a friend with Goldens for her Birthday.  She loved it!  The painting definately looks hand painted.... but that gave it more of a homemade feel!  Paired it with the Golden Retreiver wine cork and a bottle of wine for one much appreciated gift!,1
Works good. Nothing fancy but gets the job done. Bonus - my cat loves playing in the box,1
Good food for those who want a healthy food for that special puppy. This food enhanced her coat and she liked the taste. Good choice for our dog.,1
Works great.,1
Dog became extremely ill after eating.,0
The birds destroyed it immediately as it was made with to small pieces.,0
"My one year old lab mix, who is highly food motivated, won't eat them. She reluctantly ate one the first day I got the package and she was lethargic all evening. I gave her a second one today, she sniffed it and walked away. I have never seen her to this with any rawhide product. I would like to return the package.",0
"My puppy loves these and it takes her a very long time to chew it up, that's why I put babysitter, because I actually have some free time from playing with her.",1
I have a German Shepherd and this will fit the bill nicely!  I have a 09 Honda Accord 2 door coupe and we were able to get the cover to fit it just fine and secure.,1
Returning this product. It looks like it's fitted around the head but it really just is one round piece of fabric that goes around the head.,0
"I have two dogs, a 70lb & 40lb, and they can both lay on this at the same time with no problem. I ordered the large size, and it's great for the price and quality. They love it with a little blanket to cushion it a little.",1
"Very easy to put together, I bought 2 of these toy boxes and I am not very mechanical and had no problem putting them together.",1
I just got it and it is dead....,0
I bought these for my 2 Rottweilers! I was worried about the size but the large bowls are perfect! You have to remember you for fill your dogs entire bowl up of food so it's perfect for my big dogs and just makes my kitchen looks so much nicer!,1
"I love this cat litter, though usually by the version that does not involve Glade air freshener, preferring scent free. I got what I could find at the time, and this works as well as the version I usually get by the same company.",1

"This was the best idea in securing pet ID tags. It's always so hard putting the tag on the ring then attaching it to the collar.

doesn't fit even though i measured my dog,0

"Don't believe the picture, what is shown is not what you receive. There was no catnip in my bag and I only got 10 toys. Pretty upset considering it is expensive for what you actually get",0
New formula caused diarrhea for all 3 of my cats,0
My dogs can't get enough.,1
"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.",0
Birdies love these.,1
"Love the crate itself, but I don't agree with you box when it says the mesh is durable. It's already torn within the first use.",1
My rat terrier broke her leg years ago and we saw her limping again and we took her to the vet and he xrayed her leg and told us to get these pills. I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN HER! Thank you.,1
"This wasn't what I thought it was,but it was fine for what it was",1
3 lbs for $18?  Are you nuts?,0
Definitely not Rottweiler proof I worthless item that I bought,0
"This is a good harness for your medium-to-large sized dog provided the animal does not pull when you're walking.

The harness fits our mixed breed dog, although at 45 pounds, I don't consider her large, but more medium sized. Plenty of other dogs are much much larger than she is, as much as twice her size and weight in some cases.

It appears that the harness has a wide range of size adjustments available, so that a large is probably okay for really big dogs, too.

What I don't like, however, is that the harness has a leash attachment on the rump, as opposed to the front of the dog's chest, which makes it much easier for the dog to pull, and a lot less easy for the owner to control the animal.

I gave this four stars anyway, because the item looks very well made, of heavy nylon material. Unlike the Easy Leader brand of harness, this one is made well. The latter has been made with less and less durable materials, I would guess as the company has repeatedly been sold and the new owners are trying to cut their costs. The only problem is that Easy Leaders no longer hold up, and break much too easily. So it will be very easy for another firm, such as The Company of Animals, to take over, if they only get the specifications right.",1
Does not retract.  Find another product like Flexi,0
Really ticked off puppy momma here. My puppy not only chewed it off but ate it as well. This stuff is garbage,0
"Easy to put on and won't slide around and my Pomeranian cant get out of it, and after he learned he would go on a walk if he put it on he loved it.",1
Very cute but my dog destroyed it in 2 hours. Don't feel like paying $4 to ship it back. Would not recommend.,0
I was so excited when I saw this because I have one long hair and one short hair I get more out just by using the hair brush  So disappointed,0
"Uhhhh this thing is huge, 6""x8"". Doesn't fit in my tank but it seems legit. I bought a smaller one. I'll just save it for later. I like it, it's just too big lol",1
Doesnt really work.,0
I purchased 2 of these because the price was much lower than what I paid at my Vet's office (understandable)  I have not been happy with these last two because my cats were still suffering from fleas after the first month.  The one I purchased from my Vet lasted the 8 months the product claims.  I wonder if the ones sold online at lower costs are too old to be effective??  Has anyone else had this problem?,0
"Don't order this product! The item detail does not explain to you that you need an electronic fence to make these collars work. These collars come with only two probes (not the three needed to be an actual bark collar...one sensor and two shockers). I tried to tell customer service, but they didn't believe me.  I told them to come and listen to my dogs...who are still barking!

If you want these collars be prepared to spend more money to make them work.",0
"Works great, good warrantie.",1
works GREAT!,1
"Wonderful service, fast shipping, good product. Thank you very much.",1
I have a 70 + pound labradoodle who is trained but if she sees a squirrel she will try to pull or even run to where the squirrel is.  I have used the Buddy System for a couple of weeks now.  I watch carefully but my dog cannot knock me over as my body weight stops that.  I watch for the squirrels though to be extra careful but my dog has learned that once this system is in place that she stays on my left side at all times.  I would definately buy this again. I love having my hands free as in case I do take a spill I can catch myself with BOTH hands in front of me.  I am 66 years old so this is critical for me as I fell once on my face using the traditional dog leash system and I had a lot of dental work done as a result.  I highly recommend this hands free leash.,1
What works for some doesn't work for all. My cats literally almost starved themselves when I put these out so I had to switch back to normal bowls.,0
Don't waste your time and money on this one. Took well over a month to arrive. And a week later it no longer works. Made in China.,0
"I use this for my greyhounds to help with their coats.  It is wonderful!  Price was a bargain too!

"I should have read the reviews, this is a totally worthless gadget. Waste of money do not buy into the commercials or this failure of a product. Some one is making a killing in money by guilting all pet owners into purchasing this plastic thing. If it's too good to be true it is. It's true what they say there's one born every minute.",0
I was excited to try these with my foster cat.  He ate the two recommended treats which I war thrilled about because he can be picky about treats.  My excitement did not last long.  He vomited FIVE times not long after ingesting the treats and this was several hours after eating anything else.  This cat is not a barfer (cat owners will understand) so this was totally out of character for him.  I felt awful watching him dry heave a couple of times.  I love other VetriScience products but I will never be buying these again.,0
I bought these to make large dog collars and honestly they're way too huge to make any type of dog collar unless your dog is the size of a dinosaur.,0
Containment collar works great! Love having the behaviour remote aswell we don't even need to use it now just have to pick up the remote and our pitty knows to stop what hes doing!! The staff have been so helpfull aswell will defiantly purchase through them again!! ,1
"I am incredibly disappointed with this product now. The conditioner has become chunky, lacking in creaminess and consistentsy, and feels very watered down. The quality is bad now, and I'm very sad with how this has turned out. I won't order this product again and will go looking for new conditioner to use. Shame on SPA.

Original review from years ago: this smells soooooo good.  Oh my gosh.  It is now the only conditioner that I will use on my dogs.  The fragrance lasts a good amount of time too.  I wish it would last longer but all in all not too bad.  I would totally recommend it.  It is a good price too compared to Petco.  They are a rip off so stock up from Amazon when you get a chance.",0
"these are my go to toys for my cats, they love them.  I buy the set of three and make sure I keep the spare in an airtight bag to seal in the wonderful catnip scent.  You can not go wrong with these and Amazon has them cheaper than anywhere else I have found.",1
It is an inexpensive test kit that lets you know if something is going wrong so you can then do better testing.,1

Do not buy this product. It does not smell good at all and leaves your vacuum an absolute mess! Dust everywhere.,0
The size was hood but after just two months of using it it has a big rank in the bottom and isn't useable,0
My dogs have one mission with toys. Destroy everything. They can destroy tennis balls in under a minute. They chew and rip so they are masters of destruction. But not this!  They love it and it smells great. Very durable and i love that it glows in the dark. Our friend at the dog park told us about this company  and brings these balls to the park for everyone to play with and now we all have them. The only time she has had to replace them is when they get lost and one after several years and lots of dogs started to show a few cracks.,1
"Doesn't work on my dog.  A large, black lab.  He doesn't even notice a shock.",0
Excellent! Highly recommend. Quality excellent. I ordered XL for my husbands truck but it also will fit my suv.,1
"Not for the finicky dog!  I tried this on my dog a few times, and had to give up once he scratched his face bloody.  We tried prong collars, harnesses, and this - we are still on the hunt for a good walking tool.",0
Cute product but only lasted 10 min before it was shredded with all squeakers removed.,0
Great product great experience.,1
perfect.,1
I don't like these clippers at all.  I had bought them to clip my cats nails and they were very hard to handle.  My fingers barely fit the holes and because of their shortness made it very hard to clip the nails on my cats.  I ended up using the old clippers.,0
"We've had this one three months now and my dachshund has yet to make it through to the stuffing.  Got through the outer shell on the Armadillo, but that's it.",1

Just plain awful. I thought I'd give Rubies a chance despite the reviews because I thought maybe people were expecting too much from a dog costume but WOW that quality is horrific! Sizing is wayyyyy off. Do not waste your money or time I returned this and the bumble bee which the antennas weren't nearly aligned with each other!,0
The Seafood one does not smell at all. My cat likes it,1
I have a family of outdoor kitties.  We always worried about them in the winter and we tried various ways to keep them warm and dry.  We bought 4 of these and have two on the back porch and 2 inside our garage.  They really work very well and the cats just love them.,1
Purchased this in hopes that it would help my Doberman stop barking. Waste of money. Not only did it not work but it's not as describe. Did not received the bundle and when paced on my keys it just fell off. Trash.,0

Made my dog sick. Not sure what they really are but NOT real pig ears.,0
The two warning beeps allow them to run &bark at people & it takes a good minute before it shocks them. The warning beeps don't affect them. Could easily much better.,0
"Adorable collar. Great quality, super cute. Got it for my new puppy, and it's working for her great. The small fits an 8 week old golden puppy perfectly.",1
Good purchase for the quantity,1
I love this brand it works awesome. I won't use anything else on my tanks and I have quite a few tanks.,1
This is a very well made Pet Carrier. I use it for cats and a medium sized dog when we go to the Vet. .I only take 1 pet at a time so there is more than enough room. It is sturdy enough for any cat or small to medium sized dog.,1
Stopped working within an hour.,0
"It's absolutely adorable! I got this for my new pit/bulldog mix (about 65lbs) to wear outside and in his crate at night. He has a skin condition where he has hardly any hair. He appears to like it. I didn't remove stars for sizing as that was my mistake. I can be hard to size bully breeds for clothing with their wide neck and chest, but short body (in length). The arm holes were inches too big and it was about 8"" too long. He could;t wear it outside because he would accidentally pee on it. I ordered a large, but next time I will order a medium.",1

"Yes I got my money back on the big cage that I returned. But the cage I ordered was the one in the picture(with a door in each end and one in the side)  The one I got had a door in one end, door in the side and a door in the top. But I will keep it. It is ok. Thanks",1
Works great! It's forms clumps quickly and makes it very easy to clean the litter box.,1
I acruelly bought two of these because I have chihuahuas with luxating patella. Prior to fixing their issue this was a must have to help them on the funiture.,1
these don't stay in the door sills and just come off as soon as the dogs touch them.,0
I liked the idea of this and it looked comfortable.  I bought this and the comfy cone at the same time because my dog was miserable with the hard plastic cone after her knee surgery.  This one was off in less than 10 seconds. In fairness I didn't attach it to her collar but it didn't stop her from getting to her leg so I blew it off.  She is also a chewer and tried to deflate it with her teeth.  It's now on the shelf.  The Comfy Cone was great.,0
"Makes loading three dogs (2 with joint issues) into a high pickup truck much easier.  Some of the traction tape has torn from traveling in the back of the truck, more from my packing than from a manufacturing defect.  It was easy to pull back into place to remedy and will be avoided in the future.",1
Money straight down the drain (literally speaking). This product is impossible to support a deep siphon or cleanse without ending up in the drain. I guess it would be useful in a specialized tank with appropriate filtration and current that does not allow debris to build up on the substrate (a speciaized pleco environment).,0
This toy was cheap but it lasted less than a minute with my 1 year old pup. She chewed straight through this rope which is totally synthetic and not strong at all.,0
Good quality material looks just like the picture I gave it one star to I ordered a medium I received a large and she can walk completely out of the pajamas nothing I can do with it because she have reached a maximum weight. I would send it back but it's just not worth it to me,0
For a couple of years our dog has enjoyed this treat. It has not only been a great training reward that got results but has been so helpful when we were potty training for the outside. It is very tasty to our dog and we would not be with out it.,1
well made,1
Both My English & American Keets Love Brown's Food. Saw improved color on my Older Blues. Good Food - Good Price - Pecks and Kisses from my Flock!,1
Perfect!!,1
Good price for size of box,1
Our 65 pound pit / boxer loves it. Made in America by a Marine Veteran owned company. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because they shipping was slow.,1
"Recently bought 2, washed, tested, dried them, then I went to use one a couple months later, failed already. I'm about done with these reptile sprayers of all sizes and might have to switch to using garden insecticide sprayers.  I've bought these before in smaller sizes, they never last a season.",0
Worst product I have ever ordered.  Just a light scent of lavender and lemon.  Does absolutely nothing to calm my Labrador.  Do not waste your money.,0
I use it daily for my tortoise.,1
Goldfish didn't act interested as a food source.,0
"I have crystal clear water, but my nitrates have not improved. I am going to add another bag (even though I bought the right size to begin with) and see if it helps. If not I'm switching to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seachem-Purigen-100ml/dp/B0002A5VK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seachem Purigen 100ml</a>",1
The only good dog backpack on the market.,1
"Been running it for a couple of months, works great.  my goldfish love to swim through it, so cute!
Yes you need to use suction cups to get it to stay.  I soaked mine for a week to get the rubbery smell off.",1
"The pump quit with a full bowl of water after only 5 days use in the middle of the night. I have not tested the adapter to see whether the pump failed or the adapter did, but all I can say is wow...really? 5 days? I have a $60 ceramic water dish now and I am just guessing but I bet I could have found a glass or ceramic water dish for much less sixty bucks. I have two yellow labs who get most of their water from their RAW diet so they drink very little external water and I thought this might make them want to drink more but we will never know because 5 days is not long enough to really tell. What I can say is that I could probably buy a better pump at the local hardware store than this. I have water pumps in my water cooled p.c. that have run for three years straight and are still running moving larger amounts of water than this cheap thing needs to. The pumps used in the production of this waterer must cost about 10 cents to manufacture because that is all they are worth. If you want a project go ahead and buy this thing then you too can figure out where to buy a real pump that fits the clam shell and runs more than 5 days without failing. Nobody is going to tell me the pump got gummed up in five days with minimal use because if it did, that only proves how poorly designed this unit is and what an ultimate pain in the butt it would be to maintain which means it will end up being a sixty dollar ceramic dog dish for the majority of users. Buy at your own peril or better yet, buy a ceramic bowl for $6 and then a real water pump from your local hardware store and make your own fountain, because even if you buy this you will be doing the same thing if you want it to work but the difference is that buying the parts to make your own will cost you a LOT LESS.... good luck. CAVEAT EMPTOR.",0
thank you,1
Best cat toy ever. Our cat gives this thing a good going over nearly every day for long periods of fun.,1
"Cheap cheap cheap!!!!  I can NOT believe they charge 200$!!!!! It's plastic, the screws that hold it together are plastic, if you have a large breed like a pit or German Shepard they will have this cage apart in less than an hour.  Don't buy.  I like that it looks like a table...that's it.  The panels are so cheap mine cracked while I was putting in the plastic screw.",0
"I've been purchasing this dog food since I had my puppy. Now my dog has been finished 7 bags. The stool usually is soft but not liquid. Last time I bought two bags. But after couple of days, my Labrador starts had a very bad diarrhea after eating the taste of wild. They were liquid and he had accident every night in my house. I stopped feeding him taste of wild and the diarrhea stopped. After few days feeding rice and chicken then his stool back to normal soild. I re-started giving him TOW again, the bad diarrhea came back. I tried open another new bag and also had bad diarrhea. Obviously there is something wrong with the taste of wild I purchased this time. I did a research on line, a lot of people like me has same feeling.",0
Love this stuff! I've been using most of the Earthbath formulas for years ..never disappoints.,1
"They are wonderful, just what I wanted....thanks",1
Love these chews.  So do my kitties.  So much easier than using the granules.,1
"Not sure what's going on with this stuff but ever since getting my 9 month old kitten started on this, her gas is unbearably foul (no giardiasis, she had that seven months ago and was treated and cleared...) as are her feces. The apartment reeks constantly. It's been nine days and she won't touch it any more. Gonna have to pass on this and find a food for sensitive digestive systems--was recommended Holistic Select Adult & Kitten (let's see how that goes...). At least I got it on sale. What a waste.",0
good idea - bad execution.,0
"my dog has only 4 teeth in back, two on top and two on the bottom. (rescue dog who never had good care before and lost several and had to have more removed) finding treats is hard, some are just too hard for her to chew, she is a toy breed too.  these are great, they keep her busy, she has to chomp through the outer biscuit part, then gets the softer inner part. they come in a long length of about 4, and you snap off one or two, so you can tailor them to a big dog or smaller dog.  she really likes them and they don't smell so bad , some dog treats just stink so much I don't want to touch them.
update- still buying more of these, my dog really does the cutest tricks for one of these. so far so good, they don't upset her digestive system and make a good treat when I come home from errands.",1
Piece of crap had mine less than three months already coming apart,0
Great size and easy assembly. I bought it for my corgi and she still has a bunch of room to move around (22lb dog),1
Just as described. Still working great,1
If your dog have strong teeth would not recommend it. My dog broke it when he was bored.,0
"These are massive, and transparent. It's quite embarrassing carrying a giant see-through bag of excrement around the neighborhood whilst I search for a trash can. Yikes! Sorry, Pogi - I could do without the baby powder scent in favour of an opaque bag.",0
"very easy to put it on, resistance, great product",1
"Not sturdy, it needs to be reinforced, I do love how sleek it is, that's why I made it work with a few modifications",0
It didn't work.  Got it to protect my chickens from coyotes. Sprayed  it like it said. And the coyotes still came back and killed my chickens.  Waste of my money.,0
Looks nothing like the picture!!!! In the picture it is more of a tan in reality it is BLEACH WHITE I am half tempted to return it because white dose not stay white In my house I have a dog a toddler and my cat also goes outside,0
Was hoping for a little more sturdy of a toy. My dog disintegrated product in one day.,0
I have a rat terrier that barks all the time and is extremely aggressive to my other dogs. This collar is a life saver. She actually stops barking most of the time at the first warning beep and if she is charging my other dogs and growling the collar beeps and she stops her bad behavior. We are very happy with this purchase.  The other shock caller we bought is not consistent but this one goes off every time.,1
The bags were smaller than before and the chicken was really dried out.,0
"Hey all! I normally don't leave reviews but this product (and company) exceeded my expectations. I have a 9-month-old Border Collie puppy who absolutely wrecks her toys like nobody's business. And a toyless BC puppy quickly becomes a terror. So I set out to find an affordable rope toy, and this one is perfect for us.

Now given, we haven't had a lot of time for wear and tear to set in, but the rope toy seems incredibly well built (and the ball is a hard rubber and not a immediately decimated felt tennis ball) AND Ella insisted on playing with it right away--so it met her standards definitely! It's also long enough to be good for a rigorous game of tug without worrying about your hands getting too close to a mouthy puppy.

As an added bonus, the company is by far one of the best I've ordered from on here so far as customer service goes (so much so that I just felt obligated to leave a nice review). Upon placing an order, they reached out in an email to thank me for the purchase and to tell me a bit more about their product. And after receiving the toy, I got a follow-up email that directed me to where I could reach out if I had any problems with receiving the delivery or if I was unsatisfied with the purchase.

Which I am not in the slightest! I will definitely be ordering more from this company whenever Ella next needs replacement toys.",1
Something happened during the delivery process because my order came in bad shape. :( I hate leaving bad feedback but this is unacceptable especially since the food is a little pricey. Some of the cans came smashed  and oozing with dog food juice. There was a foul odor. I used only 6 cans out of this batch since they were good. You may have done your best with the packaging but UPS didn't. The bottom of the box was drenched with dog food. My dog loved the food but I was only able to  give him food from the unopened cans unfortunately.,0
"Happy I ordered the patches , they fit good on the vest, happy they came on time.",1
"This came with no scoop, broom, or dustpan.",0
It is not what I expected hard to keep it on the dog!,0
Good product made with good materials.  Had no problems/complaints with shipping or vendor.  Our dog did chew a small hole into the side in about 2 weeks but she does that with just about every cloth type toy so it was to be expected.,1
Total junk. The clip separated from the leash within 30 second of having it on my dog. I had taken him for some recall practice and once he hit the end of the 50 foot line (without force) the leash just broke and my dog was loose in an open field. Extremely scary situation but thankfully I got him to come back. I am a professional dog trainer and I can't even imagine if I had used this with one of my clients and lost a dog due to the crappy quality. I am returning it today. Very very disappointed!,0
great costume.  I ordered it for my brother's dog.  It was a big hit.,1
Great quality in fun colors.  I use this for dog training class for a small dog.,1
Great!!! My dog responds just to the sound warnings alone. A whole new pet in less than 24 hours. Thanks!!,1
Not only did I receive the wrong collar but the wrong size.  On a positive note they did refund my card and I found a collar I like better that was custom made on another site.,0
"Even though this is the mini size, the channels are too deep for my 15 lb Shetland Sheepdog. She could not reach the food at all, even though she has an extremely narrow/pointy snout, and a long tongue.  She could not manage to get more than one or two kibbles from the bowl and just gave up trying-- this from a dog who usually inhales her food in 45 seconds. What did work well for her was the ""Fun Mat Portable Dog Bowl, Slow Feeder Bowl for Dogs by Outward Hound, Mini, Green""-- that slowed her eating down to 5 or more minutes, and she is able to get all her food, and she has not vomited since using the mat (which was happening a lot before we got the slow-feeder). She also seems to like eating from the mat.",0
"They are true seafood lovers.  It's a bit strong, but they love it.",1
"I gave this to my ferrets for a while as a new ferret owner. Then I noticed that there is molasses in it, which is refined from sugar. Sugar can cause devastating health issues in ferrets. If you want to give your ferrets a good laxative to keep their system clear, I suggest an occasional can of unsweetened, regular pumpkin filling.",0
IT's a dog ball thrower- what's not to like?,1
This does a great job of removing the loose hair from my cat. His coat is nice and smooth after I use it on him. Very easy to use tool that does not pull on my cat's fur. Highly recommended.,1
"my cat had the bottom part of the rug portion, all tore up after 1 week.  It was the part that holds the post in place.  I just threw it in the garbage and will not buy another one even though it is made in America....sorry.",0
I have an elderly dog who has problems with stairs and getting around in general. Since starting this product she can manuver stairs and has a new pep in her step.,1
"Looks exactly like the picture! Makes my handsome boy look ready for Christmas! Good quality collar, although the bow seems easily detachable.",1
"This was awful, it is supper dull.",0
"I have two leashes, retractable, both 16 feet long. This one is not 26 feet long; it's 16 feet long. I had already opened it and took the dog out for a walk and tossed the packaging. Totally ticked off. Also if you have a large dog, this is not a thick longer belt. I wouldn't trust it on a very large dog.",0
my parrot hates this thing.  he will not go near it despite at least checking out new toys.  hes just completely uninterested in it.  i was surprised at how sharp the points actually are.,0
"We have used Pet Naturals Hip and Joint Extra Strength and the regular strength for over 10 years for a Lab, a Golden Retriever, a German Shepherd, (our three previous dogs - our beloved partners for 12, 16, & 14 years) and all of them lived longer and more active lives; now our 2 Great Pyrenees also get it. I have had a hard time finding the extra strength or the order has taken a long time to get it.  And the price has gone up but the original product (chicken-liver taste) is the one my dogs always like.  So even though it says out of stock or it takes 1-2 months to get it, they are worth the search for them.  (Don't order the new tasting one mine didn't like it along with others too.)  Just an add on report.  Why did Vermont Pet Naturals change?  The original formula (chicken flavor) did wonders and the dogs loved it, but this new formula isn't as good and the dogs hate it! CHANGE BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL FORMULA!",1
Great value,1
"Good for two hens for a short period of time. If you leave animals in it at night, its needs more wire and locks/latches for protection. Also had to secure the roof on better with my own hardware. Easy to clean. Very light weight so easy to move around. Is made of very flimsy wood so be careful not to lean on the doors or lift solely my the roof edges. The inside is roomy. Half of the upper inside floor is a metal sheet which gets very cold on the animal's fee; even with abundance of wood shavings.",1
Didnt trim at all.,0
"My GSD's love this toy. You can kick it, toss it or play tug. They received this toy for Christmas with a pig ear tucked inside.  Very fun!",1
My husband and I have been using this system for about a year and a half. We've been thrilled with it until lately. The price for the refills have skyrocketed and the qualitity seems to be diminishing. Sometimes a refill tray will begin to smell of cat urine by the 3rd day which is utter B.S. We are considering going back to regular litter because the price is nonsense. Very disappointing!,0
These do not fit and are not made according to size. I do not like these. They are not what show up as advertised. Don't waste you time or money.,0
You have to try this yourself and not rely on my rating.  All cats are different.  I have been searching and buying lots of different kinds of cat food that are supposedly low in protein and phosphorous to try and find something my cat will eat that will protect his kidneys.  So far I have struck out.  He wouldn't eat this.,0
Great item at a great price.,1
"One of my cats just loves to chew up toy furry mice. When he chewed through this one, I found bits of the card-boardy innards of the mouse all over the house. It made a real mess.",0
"This stuff works great to remove nitrates/nitrites and is renewable by using a bleach bath,",1
My dog couldn't walk up this ramp...to steep for the back of my Honda Pilot.  He is 100lb Labradoodle. Might be fine for a smaller dog but then why not just pick it up and put it in the car?,0
This has held up fantastically with a Lab puppy. Its her only stuffed animal she hasn't destroyed and shes had it for over a year now. Usually stuffed animals last less than a week!,1
"It is a pretty all-glass bubble counter, but the tips (top & bottom) for the tubing connection at each end are much bigger diameter than the stiffer 1/4"" CO2-rated tubing can possibly slide over.  The check valve that was sent with the bubble counter is the correct size for 1/4"" tubing...  so the problem is not that this bubble counter was intended to be used with bigger tubing.  I  took a chance...  too bad.",0
didn't seem to do much.  smells very strong of alcohol when you first open the pouch,0
Dogs love them. Watch where you step!,1
"This was a great package deal with harness and leash. I have an alpha dog, so I am always trying to restrain her. This doesn't pull against the throat as the standard collar does. My only problem was that the sizes seemed to run higher than described.",1
My cats love them.,1
"Rinsed the product before use, but some sort of white bacteria was on one of the suction cups and crashed the whole tank. Clean this thing immensely.",0
My 2 cats love this stuff. I have never seen them devour a cat food so quickly. It makes me feel great watching them get so excited to eat it. They think I am the best kitty mama ever! As for me I am impressed with the price for the quality of food and being grain free as well. My one kitty has a food allergy and this does the trick for her. If it was more than $1.67 a can I would not buy it but usually I get a 5.5oz can for that and I divide it into 4 servings per can so each cat gets breakfast for 2 days out of it and then a dry Nulo kibble is left out 24/7 for open feeding. Hats off to Nulo for putting this out there!,1
All good,1
My fussy guinea pig does not like these at all.,0
"This cat box is awful! Ive already replaced it once, now the stupid thing won't worjk at all. Everyday when I come home, something is out of alignment and it turned itself off. Look at reviews before you buy!",0
"This product is as cheap as they come.  If more than $5 was spent in material costs, I would be shocked...and that would be the only thing getting shocked, given the performance of these collars.  I returned the item after three days of disappointing attempts to ""make it work.""  I remain completely baffled how many great reviews this item has.  Incentives for good reviews, perhaps?",0
Filter broke after 1 month of use. It worked fine initially but it stoped working and the internal mechanics will not pump or filter.,0
"Product received quickly but unfortunate it gave my dog diarrhea after one lambs ear.  After waiting several days I tried again with same results.  Returned the lambs ears, placed an order for more lambs ears with a name brand that she had eaten before.  I went through the same company so they still got a sale.  Wish I had of waited before ordering.  I received a credit minus 6 missing lambs ears.  Since I had only taken two from the box, I figured I must have been shorted to begin with.  Meanwhile I paid shipping two ways and had a vet bill for $225.00 because the dog had to be put on antibiotics to clear up the diarrhea.",0
Horrible. One mess and its impossible to clean. Had to toss it right out.,0
"Nice treat pouch.  I have large hands and there is plenty of room to grab treats with no problem.  I had ordered another brand before this one but it was too small for my hands.  I would buy it again.  I do wish they had more color options available, like solid black.",1
"I got this and my dog loves it, though it is a bit bigger than I expected, approx 1 ft long.  I made the mistake of letting my dog bring this into my bed, where he normally chews bones.  I noted a large dark spot on the bed the next day and thought my dog had peed, when I smelled it I realized it was actually grease from the bone that had soaked into my sheet.  I figure that is worth a 1 star deduction, and a warning to make sure not to let it sit on soft or light colored surfaces.",1
"I thought this brand was healthy for my dog since it is vet recommended, but once I gave him this food, my energetic 6 month old puppy became very lethargic.",0
Made my tank turn white. Had to replace the water.,0
My lab chewed it apart within in 5 minutes.,0
Are just as good.  You just need to position them so the connection wires are out of the way.,1
Cats did not like it at all. Wouldn't even eat it mixed with chicken!,0
Catches Everything!  Which is what I wanted but really needs to be shaken out but is too heavy.  Vacuum only pics up so much.,1
"I have an 8 month old Mini Aussie, and she was tearing pieces off the 1st time she had it.  She's only 20lb, I wouldn't get this for any dogs this size or bigger.  Could be a choking hazzard!",0
"My dog loves bed the toy, but it came with a section that was not sewed. I had to take it form the puppy before she ripped the hole larger.",0
"Very noise unit and the glass on the tank is vibration, I'm a fan of fluval and this is the worst fluval product I ever got, not sure is the falt of the one that I got or it is noise all the time for this product, and could not find contact seller from amazon, can seller please contact me I want to return.",0
"The case is very durable and it is waterproof, it is a very good buy.",1
"If you don't tighten the screws REALLY well, it will fall off of the bars on the cage.  But once fastened securely, it serves the purpose.",0
"This guy's hard to use. Every once in a while, it'll really fly and stay in the air for a long time. Most of the time, you feel like you could have thrown a brick further.",0
"It arrived BROKEN, there was a hole on the side of the blue tray. After contacting customer service they said they would send me a new one but it never arrived. I gave up and taped a piece of cardboard to cover the hole. Also, it arrived a week late and customer service was super unhelpful. In the end, it's a decent cage with ample space for my bunny. It's hard to clean though, because hay and poop sometimes gets stuck on the side of the tray and it's really hard to get out.",0
Really bad quality of the glove:(,0
"Not happy. Have only been using it for a few hours and am extremely disappointed. Had a hard time having the item connect to my phone, app froze several times once it was connected over two hours and it says a two way radio but you can only hear or speak. You cannot do both which is misleading. I used it while in the same house as the item and it struggled to stay connected. Very saddened by the item. Love the concept but suffered in application.",0
"Unusable. Was like velcro to my dog's fur. No matter how gently and shallowly I applied it to my dog, it stuck to him like glue. Slow, gentle strokes, even after liberally applying grooming spray, pulled his hair and irritated him.",0
I bought this for my Dad for Christmas.  He loves it.  It makes a big difference when drying off the dogs after a bath.  Very innovative design with the shape and hand pockets.  He bought another one because he loved the first one so much!,1
"Stars to this dog food. My dog loves it! Since we've used this brand his skin has gotten so much better. He used to have  really dry itchy skin. Now he doesnt. I mean it is not a miracle over night, but it worked. It takes time like any food.
It's easy on his stomach too. He does (sorry to say it) not have gross poops from this. I'm glad we switched to this Brand. You are will spend more money but it's worth it.",1
Works fantastic for my dogs ears saved alot of money going to  vets they didn't help her,1
It was hard to handle I sent it back,0
We enjoy being able to find a mini size. Not too many treats come small enough for our little dog.,1
"Both my yorkies love this food.  We started one on it whenever he was diagnosed with high triglyceride levels and was having constant GI upset.  He's been on the food for about 1 1/2 years and we have not been back to the vet for this and he's been successfully off all his medications, his levels are close to normal.  We also have to limit his treats and other fatty foods.  He's a picky eater, he wouldn't touch the 2 prescription diet's he was on.  However he's always eaten Royal Canin's food and this one was a hit.  Once our puppy was old enough to be on adult food we just transitioned her to this food.",1
My dog loves this!,1
"My cats have developed a food allergy. Puking every other day was horrible for them and an inconvenience for me. A trip to the vet established a food allergy but to what, precisely was unclear. We haven't figured out what it is but this (and a turkey & giblets prime plus) works for them which is such a boon for me. After trying a lot of options I was down to my last few cans of attempts before we went to a super expensive brand through the vet (who was absolutely supportive of me not going that way) and this worked! So I'm a very happy camper.",1
"This product is huge!!! Big or small dog, they will love it! To be honest the bag smells like those fried pork chips? So it doesnt smell bad to me lol, natural ingridents and non bleaching was most definitely a PLUS +, and it also keeps my dog busy and Im happy that she looks extremely happy!!!",1
Tags were delivered quickly and are shiny and bright. Thanks for a great product and excellent service.,1
"My boy, about to turn 1, LOVES these!  He's not a fan of most treats or, he needs to spend time chewing them.  These are perfect sized and apparently taste great!",1
The dogs and kids love sharing these,1
seemed to make my dogs more excitable than calming them down.,0
"Given as a gift for my granddog, and his Mom is very pleased with it. He's a Great Pyrenees and is amazing. While he doesn't like to be brushed he loved being combed. His Mom said it was effortless as the burrs came out quickly and it certainly thinned out his coat. The bird were busy gathering his fur for their nests, it looked like it'd snowed in their backyard and there's much less shedding. Great product. Great service would certainly recommend product and company.",1
"Products are fine. Transport took a bit of time, but I can't expect anything else.",1
"I had bought a larger dragon one of these chew guard toys and it lasted quite a while. Unfortunately, this smaller one lost it's tail almost immediately upon being played with. Pretty disappointing.",0
Great design. It now takes my dog at least 8 minutes to get her food where it used to be gone as soon as she was told she could eat.,1
"My puppy loved it! Came in the wrong color scheme but personally didn't care, it's for a dog. The cover is supposed to come off for easy cleaning but my puppy (3 month old mastiff/rott mix) chewed up the zipper so I can't unzip it. But the whole pillow does wash and dry nice by following the instructions on the tag. She's actually almost to big for it now, but she still uses it all the time.",1
It's too tightly rolled to get into a flat position. I let this sit out of the packaging for days to unroll itself and put books on top to help flatten. It did not work and when I attempted to adhere to the door within a week all sides had detached. I ended up just throwing it out.,0
"Having used both the Wisdom Panel and Embark DNA tests, I would recommend the Embark test. Breed identification was more detailed, and Embark also tests for over 160 genetic problems. That info alone is worth the purchase. I bought my kit directly from embarkvet.com. It was on sale, and for a period of time  Embark was donating all the money to the animal victims of hurricane Harvey. I was so pleased, I ordered another kit using another coupon code.",1
Bought this for my small dogs and it is useless. The Velcro does not hold the bottom making it easy to escape. It is also easy to tip over from the top.,0
my dog goes crazy for these things,1
Cheaply made and not aligned with the height of my bed.,0
"Our kittens LOVE their new toy!  I knew it was going to be a hit with them as soon as I took it out of the package.  The wand is a great length and is nice and flexible.  The feather is durable and well made, not like those cheap wands found at other places.  Very happy with the purchase so far!",1
"Perfect solution for my needs, but quit working after the first day! Maybe it's a fluke, but disappointing none the less! It powers up, but won't turn on my 1200 watt heater?!? No fuse to be found! If there was a fused or gfi like a power expander I would assume that would make it an easy fix! Now I'm just left with a non working product.",0
"Our two dogs were nice and clean after using this shampoo, and I was optimistic when I saw many fleas dying in the bathtub water. However, a day or two later there were again many fleas on the dogs. Really, I don't see the point of continued use if the dogs can't go more than a day or two before the fleas return.",0
"I bought two of these, they shed and come apart way, waaaay too easily. Waste of money considering they aren't going to last. Don't dare wash it either because it will most definitely fall apart.",0
Best tooth spray. Stops cavities and bad breath,1
love these for the bullies!,1
Perfect for our kitchen's compost bucket! Exactly what I wanted. :),1
Product is not made for large birds. Quick link is too flimsy and is easily bent by a macaw's bite pressure. Bells at the bottom are made from thin gage metal and could easily cut a macaw. I went ahead and removed them before putting in the cage. I would not recommend this toy for any large parrot or macaw. too easy for your bird to injure itself.,0
it broke the first time I used it.,0
"Shorter than expected, but did the trick. I would buy another one.",1
"One arrived with a tear in it ,requested a replacement and it only lasted one day also",0
My dog has allergies and this has helped with the constant scratching!,1
"Described and pictured on the detail page as pine with oak stain. What I received (see photos) matches the summary thumbnail, which is veneered particle board that is sort-of honey colored.

In addition to being the wrong material, it is poorly stapled together, and poorly packed, so that it arrived badly dented, with the front right corner fully separated, held together only by the top rail.",0
"i ordered this cage thinking that the shipping weight would remain one pound ,upon ecieving the cage after shipment if weighed 12 pounds whats up with that the whole box was literally stuffed with brown paper like its just sumtin to make up weight seriously disappointed",0
"My little beagle/bassett mix destroyed this toy in less then 15 minutes
it was great fun to play with for a lil bit but as soon as we stopped the play she chewed it to bits with no trouble at all. ill stick with the black extreem kong line from now on. its the only one she hasn't killed  yet its 5 years old and still only just showing wear.",0
"great item , great service",1
"Food clumps and blocks the exit. Its not a closed container allowing the food to moisten and clump together between feedings.
Perhaps itll work better with small pellets. But, I would not buy it again.",0
"We purchased this toy for our dogs who like to chew after having purchased another Nylabone product (Nylabone Durachew Double Bone Bacon flavored) that they absolutely loved. We gave it to them in our car and one immediately took to it. As soon as we got home, she dropped it on our floor and it broke into several pieces! I contacted the company and sent it back. They sent a full refund and I purchased another of the bacon flavored bones. We've had them now for almost a year and they're still going strong. Don't buy this one...but the other one by Nylabone is AWESOME and the company is great to work with. Only two toys that have made it a year in our house when all others last a month at the most.",0
this item is stylish and made of good material however it does shrink with wash. So know your dogs side,1
Delivered timely and product was as expected and described,1
Love the cage. I have a 5 yr old pit who was destroying my house I was running out of places to leave her while no one was home. The cage figs her perfect with room to move. Also came with instructions on how to get the dog used to staying in the cage which work. My dog goes in there by herself she's not jumping on couches anymore to sleep or destroying my house. I would definitely recommend this item. It was easy to set up too.,1
"Our dog LOVES this bed!

Before getting this bed for our dog's kennel, we would lay several blankets down on top of one another to provide a bed. With this new bed, we've been covering it with the same blankets, simply to help keep the bed clean. It is machine washable, and it has washed up fine for us, but we're trying to reduce the amount of wash and wear it goes through.

We have found that our dog loves this bed so much that during the night she will actually get up and move the blankets out of the way so that she can have direct contact with the soft material of this bed. It's crazy, but she does it every night! In the morning when she gets up we re-arrange her kennel and lay the blankets back over the bed, only to have her get up and move the blankets out of the way again that night.

This bed is a huge hit!",1
this product is made me so happy I gave it to my cat last night and I swear I noticed the difference almost immediately he's calmer friendly he did not even try to bite me  when it was time to Feed him this morning thank you thank you thank you this product is excellent I highly recommend it,1
"All three cats and the dog LOVE these!  It's wonderful to have a treat I can give my diabetic cat! When my dog is being finicky, sprinkling a little on her food gets her to eat every time.",1
didnt stay on more than 5 min in the snow. lost them,0
Super cute little hoodie for my pup.  Great quality!,1
We purchased this after a friend purchased a no bark collar for there dog & they knew that we had been dealing with months of an unruly dog and recommended a collar. We don't even have to push the shock button he will listen just by us pushing the beep button. the only bad thing is the batteries die very fast in the collar. we take the collar off every night and turn it off because of this and it still seems to kill them fast. But its great.,1
I have a little chawennie and he barks at everyone and everything. At least he used to : ). I bought this in hopes of stopping this behavior. Of course like everything else out there I was skeptical that it would work. On the very first day I used it there was  success (Amazing). This has been one of the best purchases I have made. Thank You!!,1
My vet recommended this for our pup as she regulated. She absolutely loves days that she gets this probiotic. It's super simple to sprinkle on top and have your furry friend enjoy!,1
"Noticed display wasn't lit anymore. Unplugged it and plugged it in another outlet. Still nothing. No power at plug outlet on it. Power light not on and no digital display. Thing stopped working in less then 2 1/2 months. Sad. Return window closed in March 8th, received Feb 6th . Sad",0
Not too sturdy.  My dog was not attracted to it.,0
The tablet is easy to break into smaller pieces and my cat seems to like  the taste. His hairball problem has dissipated since taking the tablet everyday.,1
Bought this for our 6mo old kitten for when she got spayed. I bought the xxxs and she weighs 5.6 pounds. It fits her well and has allowed her freedom and comfort as she heals. Our vet even put it on her there and just sent her home in it. Great buy.,1
Love this priduct for my 6 year old siberian husky. He never gets tired of them and he doesn't make a mess while eating them.,1
"It really works!  This dog is in and out of our pond all day and kept getting hot spots or some kind of bare places.  Vet thinks she might be allergic to some kind of algae in pond.  She had been wearing a day-glo orange mesh collar, which probably didn't dry well.  She is also now taking yeast tablets and an antihistamine, but she looks so much better, and I know the dry collar plays a large part.  Before this, besides the bare spots we had seen, her fur looked like some old lady's moth-eaten mink coat, where there were small places we'd never seen.  Now she has grown in new fur and looks sleek.",1
"MADE IN CHINA!!!! My dog is unbelievably sick with diarrhea. He was fine with the treat that came in his bento ball from this company, the package for the treat ball combo says ""treats made in USA"". These however are not. Shameful.",0
This didn't do anything at all for me dog.,0
Perfect for what I needed it for.  A quick an easy access to the porch for my Maine Coons that would stop the loss of heat/AC.  They accepted it quickly and it's an easy in and out whenever I am locking up the house. (as we chose not to screw it in and still be able to have the full screen when not letting the cats out.  Very happy with this.,1
They are too hard to open. Impossible if its warmer than 80 degrees out. They also don't block the odor at all. Dont recommend.,0
Be sure to calibrate instrument first to obtain accurate measurement.,1
Very good harness it actually works. My German Shepherd is very! Strong he can rip any harness/muzzle and also drag you down the street. But believe it or not this strange harness actually stopped his extreme pulling! You just need a handful of treats to encourage him that its okay.,1
Great Quality.,1
"When I went looking for a new bird cage for my parakeets, I had some specific ideas in mind. I wanted the cage to be longer than it was tall because parakeets fly horizontally, not vertically. I wanted the cage to have horizontal bars because the birds prefer to climb on horizontal bars. I wanted the cage to have a flat top because the birds have more room versus a same height cage with a dome top. Also, flat tops are easier for the birds to climb upside down on, and they make a convenient surface to set up an out of cage play area for the birds. I wanted the cage to have drawbridge style doors because parakeets can hurt themselves lifting guillotine style doors. This was the ONLY cage I found that had all horizontal bars. I gave it an extra star for that.

The construction of the cage is good for small birds. The bars are of an acceptable durability and do not seem flimsy for thin bars. This is not the kind of construction you would want for a cage intended for large birds though.

Even though this cage fits all of my must haves, this cage could be better. First of all, it has been my experience that parakeets will prefer to eat from the highest feeder in the cage. They don't seem to like eating on the floor, but this cage comes with floor placed feeders. I also don't like encouraging my birds to hang around near their mess. Also, the smooth sides of the seed guard are impossible for a bird to climb, so if you have a bird with clipped wings, it may have trouble getting from the food back to the perches. I wish the walls of the cage were attached together differently (wired together). The entire top of the cage lifts off to access the bottom, a removable tray would have been better. Also, I like to line the cage with paper, and this cage makes that difficult as the hand holds are cut into the bottom of the cage, making the cage floor an odd shape. It would have been better to have fold-out hand holds that did not interfere with floor shape.

The entire philosophy of this cage seems to be to reduce bird mess, but it does so at the expense of your bird. I corrected this by buying feeders that I installed higher in the cage. I also put a wooden ladder on the bottom so my clipped parakeets can climb out of the bottom of the cage. Cleaning up bird seeds and feathers is really not that hard. Considering the inconvenience of cleaning this cage, it really doesn't save you any work.",1
Perfect!,1
"Dog won't use it, the drinking cup is awkward for her to get her muzzle in. Way overpriced for what it is. Back to the bottle and bowl.",0
This is not a high quality food for your hedgehog. I suggest doing research and looking for food with the proper nutritional values they need.,0
My two buns loved it. They ate the whole thing in one day! I won't be buying again since it's basically an expensive snack.,0
my reptiles loves this day heat bulb. !!!,1
"I gave these to my kitty and she walked away!!  The piglet who eats anything turned her nose up at them. Too bad - I'm always looking for healthy treats for her, but I won't be buying these again",0
"My dogs love these bones, these are just as described and they are a great price",1
"Had to add some foam batting to it though.  My dog was use to another car seat that was all foam and very cushy.  But that one fell apart after a few years and was hard to take the cover off and put back on after washing.  I like this one better.  It's sturdier, easier to take the part that's dirty off to wash.  It just needed more cushioning for my pooch.  It's not that easy to buckle in, but it is secure once it's buckled.",1
My kitten would not eat. And she eats most anything.,0
"My cat was able to travel in the car for two hours without crying the whole trip.  Just a few whimpers, then she got used to it.  Much better than confining her in a claustrophobic little carrier.",1
"My cats LOVE these and they are good for their teeth. Since it's nearly impossible to brush a cat's teeth, this is the next best thing. Also great for hairball control. Highly recommend!",1
It's a gimmick - don't buy it. Also the company is local in WA and it took over a month to get here!,0
Good product,1
"Since I could not find a size chart for this, I chose ""medium"" based on other reviews. That estimate was WAY off. The medium seems like it would fit a toy dog of 12 pounds or less. My dog is 26 lbs. and this harness won't even fit over his head. For a medium-size dog, you should probably order an x-large. I will be returning this and going to a retail store where I can see what I'm getting instead of being deceived by item descriptions and wasting money on shipping.",0
As Expected,1
"seems these mesh harnesses are for small dogs. I have an 8mth old Lab and the large was too small. I don't think even an extra large would work on him when he's adult size. They should have better instructions about size for particular dog breeds. To me a Lab is a large dog but not an extra large dog. Can't use for my dog, will have to give them away because it won't be worth shipping them back.",0
"So far, so good. We have a picky girl that will not eat just any supplement. She likes these alot and they do help. Shipping was faster than estimated. Thank you",1
Cat is obsessed!!!,1
"I had wanted an automatic litter box for some time and chose the Scoop Free because it had the most positive reviews.  The few negative reviews about cartridge leakage did worry me since my cat likes to dig to the bottom and pee directly on the tray.  But I decided to find out for myself and purchased it anyway.  Here is what I found:

Day One: I was worried that my cat would freak out at the motor since he is a HUGE scaredy cat.  He examined the Scoop Free with apprehension, but after a little while, he stepped in and went to town.  After he did his business and walked away, I pressed the little green button to activate the rake.  The noise wasn't too bad; it sounded slightly louder than an automatic can opener.  It does make a `clank' sound halfway through, which is caused by the rake switching directions.

Day 10: The unmistakable smell of cat urine was emanating from the litter box.  I didn't get the privacy hood, so I wasn't sure if that was why I could smell it.  I checked the cartridge to make sure there wasn't any leakage and there wasn't.  Even though the cartridges are made of cardboard, there is a plastic (sticker-like) film that lines the bottom of the cartridge, so that definitely helps curb potential leakage.  I changed the cartridge anyway because the smell was pretty strong.  And I don't have the best sense of smell, so if I could smell it, it must have been pretty noticeable!

I also noticed that a big chunk of poo got stuck in the rake... I took disinfecting wipes and cleaned in between to get it all out.  The poo had dried between the teeth of the rake, so it was a little tricky to remove.  But this took all of 5 minutes, so it wasn't too bad.

3 Month Conclusion: I do save a lot more time with the Scoop Free in comparison to a traditional litter box, because it requires a lot less maintenance.  However, I think their ""leave alone for up to 30 days"" claim is a complete exaggeration.  You still have to stir the crystals every couple of days to redistribute and aerate the urine.  This is important to do because the rake only removes solid waste; it doesn't ""even out"" the urinated crystals.  And you do have to clean off the occasional poo that gets stuck/smeared in the rake during the raking process.

All in all, I am satisfied with the product.  I used to clean my traditional litter box twice a day, and now I just have to do some light maintenance once every couple of days, and change out the cartridge every two weeks.

I give the Scoop Free litter box 4 out of 5 stars because there is no way that cartridge keeps for 30 days...and because those cartridges do not come cheap!",1
"I received this medal on Sept 20, put on my dog's collar Sept. 22.  On Sept. 26 I noticed it was gone.  The bale ring that attached to the collar broke open. It wasn't expensive, but it should've lasted more than a few days.  Don't suppose i could get a replacement?",0
"For two and a half months, I would have rated this 5 stars. Unfortunately, the motor has already quit for no apparent reason. I cleaned the unit per instructions, kept water level full, etc. I would not recommend this, as it should certainly last longer than 10 weeks! Very disappointed, my cat did like it... now he's back to wanting the bathtub faucet to drip!",0
Works great!  Controls barking.,1
"I had high hopes for this reflective leash but should have took other reviews more seriously. Although super reflective, this leaches clasp is a piece of junk. I only used the leash 3 times and the clasp came off twice while walking my dog in NYC! Not a safe leash and I HIGHLY recommend not purchasing since it so easily comes off!! Pay a little bit more for your dogs safety!!",0
"Pill Pockets are awesome and the only way to give tablets/capsules to my cat.  I tried the brute force approach and it was a struggle every day.  Now, with Pill Pockets, my cat doesn't even know she's taking her medicine.  Love them!!",1
"This is tight fit for my 7 lbs maltese.
Cute looking and easy to use velcro. overall quality is great.
One downside is that it does not have no hole or any measure of support for a dog leash.",1
No way these can accommodate an 80lb dog. My dog is 60 answer he's too big. Very disappointed. Plus it's all plastic.,0
"I have 3 adults cats for years I bought whatever was on sale. Since I have been feeding them only this brand, about 6 months now, there are much less stomach issues.",1
"The internal workings are made up of a four sets of plastic fingers along an axle that portion out approx. 1/4 c. of dry food and dump it down a chute.  Within merely a couple of days I noticed that it would sometimes portion out twice this amount while other times it dropped only a few pieces of kibble.  After investigating I found that the plastic fingers were already bending out of shape.  This allowed kibble to occasionally fall from the hopper to the bowl for no apparent reason.  In other rotations it would dump the current portion and most of the next, then at the next feeding only the remainder was dropped.

I use Wellness brand kibble which is shaped as small pellets.  The small sized pieces seems to be giving this device problems.  I have spent several hours trying to mod this device in various ways to keep the kibble from getting caught between the rotating fingers and the housing and straightening the bent fingers but nothing has quite worked out yet.  I would not rely on this device to make sure my cat is fed.  One may get different results with different shapes and sizes of kibble, but for me this has been a waste of money.",0
"I was in a crunch, as I needed a quick fix for protecting my CRS from a new canister filter with a 16mm intake, so I ordered the Jardin intake strainer.  It did the job, however it will soon be replaced as everything Scott said was spot on...",0
"I thought it was cute and figured why not try it for the great price?  This is the third harness I have tried and the only one my cat likes.  She likes it!  I think she feels fierce with the hoodie style and the kitty skull and crossbones.  It fits securely for an average size cat (10 lbs), but has room to adjust larger as needed.  She looks so adorable in it and got to explore the porch finally.",1
"Doesn't really lock in place and gets over turn easily
Ohhh the mess!",0
"Nice enough but nowhere near 2 inches thick. Wouldn't have purchased if the real thickness was described. This is about 3/4"" thick.",0
"I give it 2 stars, virtually indestructible for a small dog. Not pit bull proof lasted a day.",0
"Our three dogs get it every day.  They are not old but one has elbow dysplasia and one had knee surgery. It was suggested for her.
I give it to all of them every day, and our dog with elbow dysplasia hasn't limped in a long time.",1
"Great rawhide bones, just the right size for a little treat for my 6 month old lab, love that they are made in the USA!",1
"The first time I put this product on my dog worked okay. I sized her up and she was good to go, until I was walking in front of her and she pulled back to sniff something and the leader came off her nose.  Sure this is great when she pulls forward, but definitely not good when she pulls backwards.  The second time I put the product on - the clasp got stuck while the dog was wearing it.  I had taken her to a dog park and could not get the collar off.  It was embarrassing, and my dog was going nuts.  A man had to help me manipulate my dogs ears so that we could get the leader off her head.  On top of that, with all the pulling, the fabric started to rip near the nose loop on it's SECOND use.  I still cannot get the clasp open to this day.  This is a cheap product, and did not work anyways.  I received a refund for this product and bought a Coastal Walk 'n Train Head Halter and I love it so much.  Do not waste your money on the cheaper product.",0
"The breeder that I bought my cat from recommended this food. When I first bought it, they ate it eagerly. After approximately two months, my cats refused to eat it. Originally they liked the turkey and the chicken, but they totally refused the beef flavor. I also question the fact that cats are carnivores, and this food is primarily mushy vegetables.",0
Whoever invented this is awesome. Makes removing ticks and removing them cleanly so easy. We have used it on dogs and it far beats the tweezer method!,1
"It is quite heavy, however, the worst part is that my cat figured out how to unlock the door. I made sure the locks were secure with the metal hinge in its proper plastic holes. During a car ride, the cat used his face to open up the front doors by brute force. The opening right where the metal meets the plastic hole on the top of the door is perfect for him to fit his face in forcefully, and then the door opens. Three different car rides, and the cat was out within minutes every time i forced him back in. Waltzing around the car, walking on the dash board. Quite unsafe.",0
"The little litter pieces were very powdery when i opened the box. My mice don't like using it very much, and when i put it in the cage they would either try to eat it, or knock them all out of the little litter box. I don't feel safe that my mice try to eat the litter, and the fact that it is very powdered doesn't make it seem that great.",0
"I bought 2 of these for my sweet little Gerbil, and 2 days later her nose appeared to be bleeding. I googled nose bleeds for Gerbils and it said, ""what you think may be a nose bleed could is actually a secretion that comes from stress or an allergic reaction to something, possibly bedding"". Oh man, and I bought 2 of these things.. I immediately removed this thing from her cage and her nose had to recooperate for several weeks, after most of the hair fell out around her nose and face, she finally recovered and has all of the hair back on her.. I was so scared for her and was fearful that she was going to die.. Please search for something else.. Bed Fluff seems to be her happy favorite.",0
"Makes the whole house smell horrible.  We thought this would go away after a few applications, well not so much.  Will not buy again.",0
Both of my dogs do well on this product.  I will continue using it.,1
My dog stopped pulling (which is the point of this product) but every 10 feet he stops and rolls on the grass to try to take it off. I don't think he likes it very much... but my neighbors are amused whenever he decides to turn into a roly poly,1
This item is super cool.....,1
Need three boxes for my dog and he ended up being allergic to it. Had to take him to the emergency vet.,0

"I have Boston Terriers and one is especially sensitive to food. I bought this hoping to help his irritable skin out, and wound up with two Bostons suffering from food allergies instead of one.",0

Arrived exactly as promised. On time delivery and very good quality!,1
"I have two labs which can destroy a toy in the blink of an eye.  I got one if these for them and they love it, yet haven't chewed it up one bit.  They carry it everywhere and love the sound the bottle makes.  What a great investment in fun for them!  I'm ready to buy a dozen more!!",1
I had high hopes but this didn't help at all. My doggies need their ears cleaned frequently and I prefer to use something on the natural side. But this made things worse.  It made my little girls ears red and swell up and then they got crusty and flaked off her skin on the inside of her ear. She is very prone to issues and this just made her ears much worse. I got a refund and got rid of this product. I am sorry I put her through this.,0
"This has been a great investment, very sturdy and the zippers are very strong. Also the many access points are very strong and convenient. Would purchase another if needed.",1
It's easy to clean and the shield prevent my cat from throwing litter outside the box. It's very easy to clean and the scooper is also very handy! I just love it!,1
"I opened it, squeezed it a few times to get my dogs attention and the squeaker broke! Never have I had this happen before with this ball. Disappointed.",0
Easy to set and it works!  My dog in trying to scratch it off badly frayed the collar but it's still intact,1
"it never worked.

it never worked
amazon never assist in solving the problem. chats attempts, even just now, are failing. amazon even charge me ""membership fee"" which i never asked for. wrote like 15 complains over time and amazon never called or tried to solve the problem,

Didn't work.,0
Perfect for my small backyard oasis.  Maintenance required-low.,1

"I was a little hesitant to pay this much for a litter box but it has far exceeded my expectations.  It is much quieter than the Litter Mate I was using and there is absolutely no odor at all.  My only issue is that I forget to empty the box because it doesn't smell.

Because my cats are older I was concerned they would not take to it right away.  The one I was most concerned with was inside the minute I finished assembly and the other cat wasn't far behind.  They have used it every time since the day I set it up.

I highly recommend the Litter Robot.",1
This is my new monthly application. I have tried several different brands and none have worked as good as Advantage. I moved out in the country a couple months ago and with all the animals running around in the woods I know it was going to be hard to keep the flees off the dog. After talking to a coworker who suggested this product i gave it a try and it worked great.,1
"Not very happy, got this to put under some seat covers but there is not a hole for the middle seatbelt to go through.

The locking mechanism consists of a twisting piece of metal that doesn't click into place. Within the first week BOTH of my dogs came in without their tags because the mechanism had twisted into the open position allowing the tags to drop off.  Poor design and I wouldn't trust my dogs with this product again.,0
I just got the leash a week or so ago and haven't used it too much but it seems sturdy and works well with one large older dog and a medium sized puppy.,1
"These ""clickers"" are great attention-getters.",1
Very disappointed in this toy. Bought it for our medium sized dog and it was torn apart in 2 days. He got the squeaker out too. Im surprised that it didn't last longer as its a reputable company. Wont be buying this kind again.,0
Seems like a decent toy. 7lb poodle would not play with it though. Even to get the treats to fall out.,0

I have a six month old golden retriever and this toy lasted 10 minutes. He sat down and proceeded to pull the fur out of the body in big hunks! He's not what I would call an aggressive chewer either.

"Love this dog food. My dogs do really well on it. I ordered it with a subscribe and  save order, package arrived partially ripped, so the only improvement I could recommend would be better packing for shipping",1

Has alot of sharp edges and would not recommend buying. Found my snake's scales damaged and cut everywhere.,0
This collar left actually puncture wounds in my dogs neck. The collar was not too tight and was not left on him at night.,0

"My Dooly is a 15.5 year-old Maltese with a host of problems that include glaucoma, heart murmur, tracheal collapse and dementia. I've been treating him holistically with vitamins and herb supplements, no hard drugs. He was doing pretty good, but his seizure first started early this year in March. He was on the seizure med for a couple of weeks but I had to stop because he was almost dying from its harsh side effects--excessive hunger, wobbling, and inability to do his nature calls. It was after I took him off the med he was actually doing better and coming alive but still had seizures every couple weeks or so. That's why I was looking for more natural supplements and got this based on from the positive reviews. He was having seizures twice a day! after he started taking this formula, and this never happened before. And that's why I had to take him off this liquid. I really wished it would work for him, but unfortunately, it did not. It may work for certain dogs, but not for every dog, as each one has different types of physical make up. I've been giving him coconut oil, lecithin and taurine specifically for seizures and he seems to be doing much better than when he was on this liquid. I'm still searching to find a remedy that can help with his neurological problems of seizures and dementia.",0
Everytime our dog would shake the collar would beep and the sensitivity dial would turn to the highest level just from her shaking or scratching. The collar would beep just at the sound of the collar clicking or a door closing.,0
Works awesome and SO much less expensive than ones marketed for reptiles.,1
Perfect for training sessions,1
Came fast looks good,1
"This is our cat's favorite plaything!  He managed to get in the closet to attack and eat our other two ""dabird"" feather toys when no one was looking.  We ordered 6 of them this time.",1
"Love them, and so do my fish. Great big balls of moss, and thank you for the extras, I love how they look.",1
"This cage cover fit my large dog cage perfectly! It has windows on the sides and on top, which is perfect for breathing room. Worked great for what we needed it for.",1
"We've had a terrible time with this fountain.  The water is pumped into a chamber that goes up over the seam where the top of the fountain joins with the bottom, and this seam often leaks.  Poor design.",0
"Broke the first time I used it, the tab that latches it snapped right off.  I have one cat, and it fills up very quickly. It's about the size of half a shoebox.",0
1 can for that price what a ripoff,0
Love this. I don't believe in electric collars so this was perfect for helping me to train my dog.,1
This product made all my cats vomit multiple times a day. They stopped as soon as I switched back to their old food.,0
Great design (run a little smaller in the neck than actual measurements but material stretches).  We tried the small but the neck is way too small for the breed.  Appears to be much more comfortable on our Bulldog pup (12-13 weeks old).  He doesn't scratch at it the way he did on the other harnesses (neck runs small and is not adjustable though it does stretch quite easily) .  He won't be in the medium much longer so we went ahead a purchased the large as he grows.,1
Loved this thing until he chewed through its zipper.. It's in the dust bin. One month of functional use. Plus it is dead dead dead.,0
I received these flossies and they were full of mold and definitely not suitable for consumption.  There was a recall by the manufacturer some time ago and flossies are hard to get a hold of.  Either these were recalled and the seller is still selling them or the seller is storing these in bad conditions.  It took more then a month to deal with the seller to finally get a shipping label and full refund.  Buy with caution.,0
Chicken is always a safe bet as dog treats for my three picky pets. These did not disappoint.,1
"smaller then i invisions, but worked great for what i wanted it for. its fully split if you want to have just have in your tank or a half on each side. very versital",1
Arrived with broken hose fitting. Would not pump water.,0
"This brush does exactly what I wanted, which was to remove undercoat and have less hair in the house! I used it on my two labs.",1
This toy is great! I'm going to buy a second one! Treats don't come out too easily and my very aggressive chewer can't tear it apart.,1
"Nice quality, and I didn't realize it has a piece of plexiglass on the front so a dog won't be able to chew or scratch the wood. My dog considers it her home base and goes in it herself at bedtime.",1
Excellent Freshner!  One drop is sufficient and last a long time!  Great Bargain!,1
Great value and quick shipping.,1
Great little dog house,1
"It wasn't successful, both cats were pretty awful on a 3.5 road trip/move. Doesn't smell bad but is not the ""miracle"" spray I was told it was.",0
two cats I know greatly enjoy this item every day,1
"ENORMOUS even for a German Shepherd, but I can sure hear him coming...",0
Ordered this for my new furbaby and I'm highly satisfied with it. Engraved just as I wanted and it looks great!,1
The product is great my dog loves them but it is overpriced.  I had purchased them before but was unsure of price and size of package.  It stated it was cheaper than pet stores.  When I received the package it seemed a bit expensive for the amount of treats ($6.75 each).  I checked other sites and I could have bought almost three bags for 1.  So as they say buyer beware.,1
"I was hoping these would be decent dental bones, but quite frankly I don't think anything compares to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Redbarn-Filled-Bone-Peanut-Butter-Small-3-inch/dp/B000633Y40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Redbarn Filled Bone Peanut Butter, Small 3-inch</a>&nbsp;when it comes to my dogs dental health. The Brushing Chews are superior to rawhide which I've learned is far too risky or my dogs who are avid chewers. I'll stick to the real thing for my furball's dental health.",0
Great product!,1
"Does not work, save your money and don't order this!",0
Was not as expected. Do not recommend.,0
"I read the other reviews for this before buying. The shape of the carrier is ok, and flexible enough that you can squeeze it in the foot space in front of you while flying. The size seems perfect for our dog.

However, it had a strange polyurethane like smell that our 11 lb cavalier puppy HATED. So, I washed it to see if the smell would go away. Even after coaxing our dog in with treats, he still freaked out every time I put him int here. He was so miserable, and I really think its just because of the smell.

I ended up splurging and buying the sherpa carrier, which I can't explain, but he loves it! I think it helps that he enters from the top insted of the sides like this one.

Anyway, I thought the Bergen one seemed like the best value, but in the end it was a total waste of money because we've never been able to end up using it.

I will say though, the Sherpa one is so sturdy it is hard to fit under the seat in front of you when flying. I ended up buying a large, which is much to big for our little guy (11 lbs now)  I should have gotten him the medium Sherpa.",0
Cute idea but our cats were bord with it.,0
I bought this to put in my room to give my cat an alternative drinking place other than my fish tank! I bought the stainless steel version for the kitchen and I have to say that this one is far better in my opinion. Washing the ceramic surface is easier than the stainless steel and the top finish stays nice and shiny whereas the metal one has started  flaking off. My one slight issue with it is that the top piece does not sit quite as firmly in the top as it does in the metal version.,1
Best dog shampoo,1
Was quite hard to put together and I needed another clip to attach it to the cage and didn't fit on very well and had to prop it up - took it of in the end which was a shame as my hamster loved it.,0
Terrible.  The clear clips that hook the light onto your aquarium are poorly designed.  Very difficult to put light on aquarium with these clear clips.  I found I absolutely neeeded a second person to help put this light on because of the design of the clips.  The clear clips come apart easily as your putting the light on and those pieces will fall into tank as your trying to put it on.  Not fun !,0
"Highly recommend. This is a great product, it is very durable and the setup time is minimal. Another pro to this product is that it is water resistant.",1
my dog loves them. great value for price. less grains than most treats.,1
Comes on and off randomly.  Never worked properly.,0
"This product is extremely dangerous.  My feeder roaches died, and my hedgehog died from bacterial food poisoning after eating the roaches. He died despite extensive veterinary interventions and consults from veterinary pathology and internal medicine  I have opened a claim with the manufacturer, as my product was shipped to me unsealed.  I was assured by the manufacturer that it should be double sealed - with one layer being a pressure seal.  I have opened a food-safety inquiry with Amazon as well, because there is a clear issue of product tampering.  Somewhere between Seachem Laboratories production of the item and Amazon's selling of the item, the product was tampered with and bacteria was introduced.",0
"The stray cats I feed seem to love it. I know it seems like hungry stray cats are not the best critics since they don't get a lot of food, but my stray and ferals can be finicky. But they seem OK with this. And from a human standpoint, this doesn't have a lot of gritty ""dust"" left over at the bottom of the bag or whatever container you store it in when you are done. There is some, but not an excessive amount like with some brands or varieties. To be sure, there are more expensive brands that probably provide better nutritional value for your cats. But the price is right for this, and there is nothing wrong with it. Best to mix it with some canned food for moisture.",1
"I sent my dog's sample in at least 3 weeks ago and have received nothing back.  Every time I check the website with the number I was given, I receive a message from DNA MY Dog saying that the sample is still ""in process"".  When I finally got the results, they said Bassett Hound (I had told them that) plus greyhound and whippet.  Really????  There is NO WAY!  My dog has longer hair than any of these breeds,  different ears and different body.  My vet found the results laughable.  I think they chose randomly, wish I had never wasted my money.",0
"Too short.  I should have actually measured out how long it would be before I ordered it.  I tried using it once, but it was awkward and uncomfortable to have such a short leash.  get a longer version!  needs at least 1 more foot on it.",0
Product Description says the ramp has removable carpet tread however it come with this plastic material that is glued down and NOT removable.  I have had 2 shipped to me and both are the plastic material on top.,0
Couldn't attach to cage. Really wasn't well made. Requires you to make whole to have the food outside going in.,0
Having a hard time getting it into my cat. She turns her nose up no matter what food I hide it in  Thinking maybe something like cream cheese or butter would work?,0
These didn't even yield one bubble. The bubble solution is so thick and gross that it's impossible to create any bubbles with it. I ended up getting a refund.,0
"Works like it said it would, only 4 stars because the entire family will have to help-a little slow for one person.",1
More convenient.  My dogs love them.,1
Great.  Muffin has been on this food for years.  I think it makes her have a nice coat and she sheds very little.  Good Product.,1
Sizing was off even though I followed measuring directions.  Ill be modifying them with additional velcro rather than returning them though. Material of one was snagged but overall they feel more padded than others Ive bought in the past.,0
Terrible shipping and handling on this product. Fully half of the sticks I ordered were damaged so bad there was no treat left on the sticks. Basically I ended up paying twice the price for the treats that I can use. Not a good deal and I will not order again.,0
this makes my dog's gums bleed badly and its brand new!,0
"They don't last long. Last maybe 2 to 4 days and then my cat gets them off. Did everything the instructions said, but they still come off. And my cat actually still scratched THROUGH the nails!!! He scratched and his nails went through the caps!",0
"The cat litter mat is stupid AWESOME. I'm constantly stepping on litter, rolling my eyes because I spot litter in crazy places...they find a way to get it in my BED! I sweep daily, change their box daily, put mats down that are supposed to trap litter (wash those weekly and still smell from accidents meaning I have to replace), have a covered box with internal ""trapper walk way"" (igloo style), turn it toward a wall so they have limited areas to track litter - my girls (Kenna and Nadia) make a mess like no other cats I've owned. It's borderline impressive. Got this mat without much hope since the past 3 years they always get the best of me. BEST THING EVER. After a few days I noticed a HUGE difference around the house...went to check on the mat situation and saw it trapped a ridiculous amount of litter that normally would be all over the house (see picture). If you're on the fence, don't be. It's so worth it.",1
"The sence is too strong that my cat  and she will not use it. Plus, it  is not good if you have allergy.",0
"Only useful if your dog is the strongest in the world--it's nice and thick, good quality, but even my bf can barely get it to stretch at ALL. :/",0
What garbage.  Dog barks constantly and this thing does nothing but blink the green light that supposedly means it's on.  Don't waste your money this thing is absolute crap. Has not 1 time stopped or deterred a single bark.,0
"My dog hated it.  I gave it away, and it was passed on twice.  Nobody wants it.  It is too steep for the dogs to feel comfortable",0
great quality,1
Great quality create. I would definitely recommend this crate.,1
"Easy to assemble and has lots of great options.  Our two cats loved it at first, but for some reason have not shown as much interest in it anymore.  I hope that they will get back to it to bird watch in the spring.  Still a wonderful piece for cats to use.",1
My dog is a 70lb 10 year old Samoyed which has started to have some trouble with arthritis.  I bought this bed because it said he would help him stay comfortable and sleep better.  This is exactly what this bed has done. I just revived it and he is comfortably asleep on it with out spending a long time trying to fluff it to make it more comfortable.  This is a great product.,1
"Buyer beware. This cage was not at al described dimensions-wise. The interior of the cage was 21x24 (lxw), and the product page itself has two different sizes (when I ordered it was just 24x24x35.5 but now theres a photo that says 17.5x17.5x35 or so), neither of which are what I got.

One of the bars is so badly bent I cant put the top tray in - fine for me since I didn't want to put the top tray in so I could let more light into the cage, but still clearly defective.

Assembly was fine and relatively easy and in general the cage is fine, but oh man you get what you pay for.",0
"My dog destroyed this in half an hour. He ate the ears off, which were the only part he could fit in his mouth. Too big too squeak.",0
"Old Mother Hubbard is a US based manufacturer that produces all its dog food here using high quality ingredients. That being said, they don't charge the silly prices that all those high-falutin' fancy brands. Good, no-nonsense dog treats.

And of course, being liver-flavored, our dog loves loves loves them.

OMH also makes great charcoal cookies that help with digestion/dog breath. Dog loves those too, though perhaps not as much as we do...",1
"Other clippers of the same general design have cut neatly through my cat's nails, this sort of crushed them, like a toothles grandma taking a bite out of some toast. Wouldnot recommend.",0
Got the collar to match the leash. Very pleased with our purchases from LupinePet.,1
Very helpful  for my medium size dog. I find them nice looking and sturdy and way better made than any I've had before.,1
Tried 3 sets of batteries. First attempt and it wouldn't come on at all. Second attempt it came on only when my husband put his full body weight on it. 3rd attempt was actually putting it to use with the cats.... never emitted a sound. Waste of money.,0
"There was no foil to make sure this didn't spill out, but arrived as described.  New bottle and new shampoo
Not too fragrant and doesn't dry out too much",1
My little guy suffered two urinary blockages. For anyone who has gone through this knows how scary it is and EXPENSIVE it is to treat. My vet told me I could keep him on his regular food as he mainly eats wet food but I started feeding him Halo's cat food- the wet chicken formula since it's not as high in protein which caused part of his problem. This dry food is excellent for urinary health issues. My cat has not suffered another blockage since I have had him on this food regularly and he hasn't had anymore UTI's either which I am happy about and hope it continues. And the best part is he loves the food so I didn't have to worry about that either. They use real chicken in this food and there is no by product or fake crap. If you have a cat who suffers from FLUTD or UTI- give this food a try- it works geat!,1
turtle refuse to eat it,0
"I use this stuff for all of my critters. I have two gerbils and a hamster, and have cared for lots of animals over the years, and they seem to do great with this bedding. It's packed pretty darn densely in the package so you get way more than it even looks like at first, and the animals fluff it up even more. I've always gotten the brown kind at PetSmart but I decided to go through Amazon this time and chose the blue... as much as I'm sure the pets don't care what color their bedding is, I will admit it's kind of fun seeing the little dwarf hamster nesting in blue fluff. :) I'd recommend this stuff for sure, and definitely over any wood shaving bedding.",1
"Great easy, simple recipes! I love knowing EXACTLY what my fur-babies are ingesting =)",1
"Doesn't stick well and the perch fitting keeps coming apart, fell off and dropped my conure mid shower... He's not getting back on anytime soon.",0
What can I say it's the best stuff on the market,1
My dogs nose is the envy of the town now great stuff,1
"Did not work as well as the one I purchased from wildrose website, even though they were supposedly the same model",0
"It didn't help my puppy to relieve her itchy dry skin, neither help her to smell better....",0
These are very nice tags.  Letters are big and clear.  Shipped very fast!  Completely satisfied.,1
I have two Saint Bernard's with severe hip dysplasia and after switching to this supplement most stiffness and limping have completely gone away! It's a bit more pricey than the last supplement but much cheaper than paying for pain pills for two dogs.,1
Very nice with the protected prongs. Doesn't hurt the animals like the other one did.,1
Not just like the picture. It tricked me again. On the picture it has the elastic to hook on to. It has a medal hook instead and only took my cats a couple of minutes for the toy to separate from the rubber hood withe the medal connector. They use super glue that doesn't stick very well. I have purchased these before never with any good luck. They always fall apart in a couple of minutes.,0
"Flimsy and the bars were too wide for the carrier.  Even if they had fit, I would not trust this thing to transport my bird across the room...",0
This lasted less than one car ride. Even though secured in the back seat my puppy managed to scratch the lining and tear it and then proceeded to bend the metal piece on the top so it is sunken in. Waste of money.,0
too short... not worth buying.. nearly useless.,0
My husband put this together in about an hour or less. My cat LOVES it!! We had planned on building out own but when we saw this huge one for about one hundred dollars we couldn't pass it up! There was no way we would be able to build this big of one for less. She loves to sit up top looking down on all of us ,1
"At first I thought this was a game changer.... then I discovered it your dog is a drooler (which mine newfy-poo is) then the material will stretch and my dog saw another dog and he slipped out of it. My dog is 90lbs. and very strong while I stand 5""3 and 135lbs. so needless to say that I didn't stand a chance and he took off. I was very much on board with this product until this experience. If I were to make it any tighter on him to bypass the expanding while wet, I would consider it borderline abuse.",0
"My cats are normally on a grain-free home-made diet but recently one needed pain meds that have to be given on food.  She was already not eating because she didn't feel good and I tried everything I could think of to get her to eat.  I saw this in the store and I remembered that she likes cheese so I bought a can.  She licked up all the juices (and her meds!) and then picked out the cheese bites and went and finally rested peacefully for the first time in days.

I raced back to the store, bought the last three cans, then came home and ordered a case.  She will need these meds for the rest of her life and she will be getting Fancy Feast for the rest of her life if that is what she continues to want.",1
"This collar hurt my dog more than it helped him.  I tried it with the neck very tight & nose strap loose enough to go to the nose but not over. My puppy wheezed, the collar didn't stay up high behind his ears (with just 1 finger room), and the nose strap kept sliding up to his eyes & cutting him under the eyes.

So the trainer adjusted the collar to be looser & the nose strap to be tighter. So now there was no wheezing, but the tighter nose strap just made it cut him more sharply under the eyes and slide up over his eyes more easily which drives him crazy (understandably). He now has bald spots under his eyes & is always rubbing them.

My dog's a lab puppy, normal sized, but the control this collar gives isn't worth harming my dog. Going to try the haltie (sp?) collar or something else. So be warned - it does help keep your dog from pulling, but it might not be worth it.",0
scared my dog,0
Works as expected.,1
"My cats love these things .... I have 7 cats and 5 of them use them constantly and 3 of them actually sleep in them.
Wish I could find them in a store around here consistently. Only TJ Max so far.  Thanks goodness for online shopping",1

"Read dimensions with caution! This castle is so small and not worth the price, probably returning",0
Does not work. My dog initially don't like the smell immediately after it is sprayed but within 5 mins it don't bother her.,0
Easy to put on and take off.  Nice looking.,1
This is a great pond pump - delivers lots of air - multiple settings is a plus - fairly quiet - put in the pond - now to see how it does in the cold Illinois temps,1
Extremely big with teeth far apart & pointed. Might be good for a dog but not for a cat,0
"Waste of money. Not nearly as sturdy as they claim. My dog, who isn't a strong chewer destroyed one while playing fetch. Not even chewing on it.",0
"This collar shocks if the dog even somewhat touches something hard to the collar! Very incorrect for training. The dog gets shocked when laying head down on wood floor, once receiver touches floor it shocks.",0
"Was very happy with product when first received. However the first time I left my 10 week old puppy in it with all the doors zippered she tore through the material where the zipper meets the floor and got out. Fortunately we only left for a short period of time as I was concerned leaving the puppy. Oh big factor you need to know is she is what you call a Morkie.
Weighs less than three pounds very tiny. So we are not talking even a medium size dog but a toy breed. So needless to
say this is not something I would recommend.",0
"works great , just what I needed",1
"Stylish bed, looks good in the living room. Best of all, my hound loves it and sleeps there all night long!",1
Great bed...but dog had destroyed it overnight. Chewed it to bits and had stuffing everywhere. Do not get if your dog is a chewer.,1
I have owned this filter for less than 1 year and since it only requires cleaning every 90 days have cleaned it 3 times total. Today the plastic handle that locks the top in place broke off and I somehow managed to get it closed but it is essentially junk now......very disappointed in this product.,0
Dog loves them,1
I feed my puppy the blue buffalo freedom grain free food for small breed puppies. He does well on it & I thought he would like & do ok with these treats but they give him diarrhea. I tried them a couple of separate times & he ended up with diarrhea each time.,0
Great just wish they weren't so expensive.,1
Useless,0
Will definitely purchase this product again.  Arrived on time. Was exactly what I ordered and it was affordable. I am pleased with this product.,1
I was expecting a lot more in this product since its been made in USA,0

"I purchased this tunnel for four rescue kittens, now seven months old. The design is such that it will not collapse like other tunnels I have owned, offering the kittens continuous playtime without me having to reform a collapsed tunnel, The three tunnel entrances provide opportunity for all kittens to use it simultaneously. Overall a high quality item that keeps
my cats busy!",1
I love this cat door!  I have a 1 year old son and needed to babyproof the door to the basement. The first thing I tried was a baby gate but having to keep the basement door ajar all of the time made getting from the breakfast room to the kitchen a pain. To fix this we installed this super cute door and also put a childproof door knob cover to make it safe. It's too small for a crawling baby to get through but large enough for my two long/tall male cats (largest cat is ~12 lbs and not fat). Now we can easily get through the hallway and my cats LOVE being able to easily get to basement to use litter box or hide during baby playdates LOL.  Plus it doesn't look as tacky as the plastic ones with flaps--it blends in well with our formal space. Its become one of my favorite features of my renovated house!,1
Chinchillas likes it.,1
Great for trimming around our Persians eyes-,1
Great,1
They did fit and were the right size but the material is cloth like and when they are wet they really don't protect his feet at all. They're not out door shoes,0
"I'm very disappointed in this product.  These ""sticks"" are hard as rocks.  I don't see how any dog can bite into them without harming their teeth and then their digestive track.  The ""best before"" date is 1/2019, but there's no mention of when they were made.",0
"Although this product shows it is ""made in the USA"", our box and the product its self, stated ""Made in Thailand"", as others have reported.  This was a wasted purchase as we will not be feeding this to our dog, it's going in the trash!",0
Awesome product.....highly recommend it,1
I love my GLaDOS plush!!! The flashing light is an awesome feature. I love all of the lines of dialogue that were chosen for her. The Battery pack is easily accessible via a velcro lined pocket in the back. The pack also has an on/off switch as well. This means that I can choose when to get insulted by GLaDOS. It also makes the batteries themselves last longer. This plush is also really soft and the perfect size for snuggles. I love having GLaDOS with me on the couch while I play Portal 2. She was a huge hit at a geek party that I went to as well! This was definitely a great buy!!!,1

original purchase was faulty ( it leaked) but i notified amazon and it was replaced very promptly at no charge.  the fountain works like it should and my cat (anheuser ) enjoys drinking from it.  the resevoir is large enough so that i only have to add water once per day.  the fountain is somewhat noisy but no real distraction to me.  hippyman41,1
"My dog loves this food.  I had him on natural balance lamb and brown rice before but he would only eat his food as a LAST RESORT.  It's been a few months and he still runs to the kitchen and patiently waits when I ask him if he's hungry.  Just a note:  my dog is a blue Weimaraner that has a sensitive stomach and dry skin issues.  The only food I could feed him before that agreed with his stomach was natural balance for limited ingredient diets but I noticed that his skin was always dry and itchy even with the addition of fish oil.

(Grizzly Salmon oil I get on Amazon in a large pump bottle is AMAZING for his coat.  People always comment on his shiny coat and ask whether he was recently groomed though it's been months since he's had a bath.  http://www.amazon.com/Grizzly-All-Natural-Supplement-Pump-Bottle-Dispenser/dp/B0002ABR6E )

I transitioned him over to Taste of the Wild pacific steam after emailing the company and receiving samples.  He scarfed it down, but I think he normally does this when I give him something ""new"".  As I mentioned, it's been months now and he still loves it, and his skin is no longer flaky and dry and he has yet to have any stomach issues.  Amazon has the large bags of this food at a great price with prime two day shipping!  Definitely recommend if you have a short haired dog with a sensitive stomach and dry skin.",1
Didn't work for my pet,0
Great build,1
"It's a winner!  Our cat loves sisal, and the height of this is great.  She loves being up higher closer to our level.  She is about 8-9 lbs. and it seems very stable for her weight.  If you have cats that really push off when they jump, you might want to stabilize it more, but very sturdy otherwise.",1

"Despite the label saying it's machine washable, the second time I washed it (following the instructions) I opened the washing machine door to find the inner pillow stuffing everywhere and multiple large holes in the bed. I thought the bed felt cheap to begin with - thin fabric and didn't provide much padding - and the fact that it couldn't withstand two washing cycles further confirms my feelings. I have small, old dogs who don't chew, dig, or destroy their beds in any way shape or form. This bed looks nice but is kind of a disposable, short term one. Pretty disappointed.",0
"Works perfectly, and very well made.",1
"No fun, say the cats!",0
I'm sorry but this isn't for me. I didn't notice any improvement in the tangles and personally I don't like the smell at all. It reminds me of rose scented eau de toilette.,0
doesn't work sofa is damaged and cats still fight,0
"Haven't found a tick on my any of my dogs since being introduced, and using this collar. I have a small farm, and, so, these are farm dogs, and, even with frontline, would ALWAYS have ticks. LOVE this product! Highly recommend.",1
Thefirst time I gave this to my dog he could eat the four corners!! I thought he would take more time on chewing and enjoying,0
"My Aussie responds very quickly to a whistle, as she often likes to range far from me as we walk. I'm
always losing them, forgetting them or giving them to my dog friends.  I've ordered these twice so I
always have one handy. Not all of them ever seem to work but I try them out on her and when they
work well, her ears perk right up. Even at that, these are a good buy. I tried an e-collar first but the
whistle works just as well and without annoying her.

We trained in the house for two months at first. Just blow-feed, blow-feed, over and over. I used
cut-up weenies....her favorite. The first time we tried it outdoors, she  had just found another dog
to play with and I thought, ""This won't work.""  She was pretty far away but when she heard ""her
signal,"" I could see she became alert, gave the playmate the brush and came running to me for
her weenie treat.  I suppose it depends on the breed of dog, but I would think if one conditioned
a dog properly, most will come with a whistle.

I attach them to different kinds and colors of lanyards and they are just fun to work with. Often

"I was about to order this product on Amazon and then I looked at all the reviews.  I did a search for the battery on line and found it at Walmart for $6.88, free shipping!  Great deal.  The ones on the walmart website didn't have any negative feedback either.  I hope this helps anyone looking to order it.",0
"My teething puppy adores these.  She is a gentle chewer (considering the teething at least!) and they don't last as long for her as a bully stick or a cow trachea, but I think that is because they are her favorite.  Most chews she works on for a little while and then leaves for later, these she works on without interruption until they are gone.",1
Dog tore nose off on first try.,0
"This item in small was advertised as fitting dogs up to the weight of 25 pounds.  My Bichon/poodle weighs 21 pounds  - the fastener barely closed and had to be returned.  The material used to make the halter was stiff, the edges were sharp and there's too much plastic which would be very uncomfortable for the dog wearing it.  It's not an expensive item - I'd have paid more for a halter that fit well, had less thick plastic and no sharp edges.  They need to change their advertising and say that the small halter fits dogs up to 20 lbs NOT 25; they also need to improve on the product.",0
"My two shih tzus loved this food and it gave them firm poop with little smell. Got through about two bags of this but had to switch to a prescription meat based food because one of my pooches has recurrent bladder stones and the vet says she must be on a strict diet. I would love for them to stay vegan as I am, and I do not like purchasing animal products but I cannot put my dog through another surgery. Only con is Halo Vegan Medley is expensive, but so is the prescription food I'm now buying.",1

This grass wilted and died within a week and had many bugs in it.  Ended up throwing it out.,0
"I recently bought the extra large coat with the size specifications given this coat should have at least fit that length dog.  It did not.  In fact the extra large could barely fit a cocker spaniel.  since when is this an extra large dog.

Picture is nicer than actual item.  I think coat is made more for a stuffed toy then live animal.",0
This is an excellent product. I was prompted to try it after purchasing and loving the PetFusion Cat Scratcher and I have not been disappointed. Other mats trap litter... which I can then never get out to clean it! This mat keeps litter fairly well but is easy to wipe down. Will purchase again (if I ever need another).,1
"This collar is NOT leather! My dog broke it after wearing if for just a few hours. It was obvious when it broke that it was not leather but instead some sort of cheap synthetic material. Not worth a dime, let alone what I paid for it. The description is all lies. Do Not Waste your money on this product.",0
"I ordered these kabobs for my very picky Havanese. I used them as his special bedtime treat (after teeth brushing).  The kabobs in the first six bags I ordered looked just like the picture (like chicken treats wrapped around a stick) and my dog loved them.  The sticks in the first two batches were about 4 inches long and I broke the treats in half.  I just received my third batch of three bags.  They look horrible and nothing like the picture (in fact they don't even look like chicken!).  The sticks are about 2 to 2-1/2 inches long (not long enough to break).  My dog turned his nose up at what used to be his very favorite bedtime treat.  What makes it worse, is that when I read the description on the bag, there's a warning to wash your hands after handling and something about the treats being exposed to radiation for your safety.  I have no idea what that means, but safety and radiation in the same sentence seems contradictory to me and a bit scary, and of course I don't have the bags from the first orders to compare to this most recent order.  I will not order these treats again.  What a shame.",0
Was buying a ton of these since my wife went on a tear over dyes in dog biscuits.  Last delivery had 50% crumbs in both bags.  These are too expensive to have a poor quality.  Contacted customer service twice.  Still waiting for a response.,0

I used a 100W infrared bulb in here. Today I noticed the bulb hanging loosely from the Dome. The part where you screw in the light bulb was completely burnt and fried! Fire waiting to happen! This dome is not compatible with 100W bulbs as it says on the packaging. Waste of money. Disappointed.,0
Our Pug just loves these!,1
"Life saver! I have three pets and found out there was a flea infestation at home. I applied Frontline once and it was not enough due to the amount of fleas. I gave Capstar to my cats and dog daily for a couple of weeks, along with combing every evening, washing all bedding daily, vacuuming daily and spraying with Vets best. I brought the number down of fleas I would find daily on them from 7 then 5 then a couple to zero after those two weeks. If it was not for Capstar I would have not been able to kill the fleas daily and they would continue to lay eggs and multiply.",1

Great full-sized plants arrived quickly and in excellent condition. They look great in the aquarium. I'll order from them again when I need more plants.,1
"I wish I had read the lower star reviews on here before purchasing this item.  I have a six year old male neutered cat.  He was in good health and had never had any UTI problems.  He had been on Science Diet Indoor, but I was concerned about all the grains it contained.  After reading a lot about grain free food for cats, I was impressed by the Blue Buffalo marketing and all the five stars, etc., and to be fair, it probably is a fine food for most cats.

I had purchased a bag of this food locally and my cat seemed to like it and so I bought two big bags on Amazon.  He loved this dry food and ate it readily.  Subsequently, he began having occasional episodes of vomiting, but I thought he just had a temporary upset stomach and passed it by.  After a few months of being on this food solely, he suddenly developed a problem urinating.  Fortunately, I caught it in time and got him to the vet before it became too serious of a situation.  The vet gave him an injection and advised me to use the Hill's Prescription C/D.  A few days later with the C/D, and he seems to be a lot better and he is urinating properly again without trouble.

I do not particularly care for the ingredients in the Hill's C/D either, but at least the first listed item is ""chicken,"" and he seems to like it and will eat it, and it appears to have helped him a lot for now.  I am trying to transition him to wet food, but that is only going so well, as he mostly just laps up the gravy part and added water, but that is at least adding more moisture to his diet.  He always drinks a lot of water anyway, so that was why I was not particularly worried about urinary problems from the beginning, but after reading some of these other lower star reviews, I now think it may very well have been this product that caused the problem, but of course, in fairness, I can only surmise and I do not truly know, still, I am definitely going to throw out what is left of the expensive Blue Wilderness that I have for the raccoons & possums to dine on.

I hope that my cat does not have to stay on the C/D forever and I am looking for an alternative to it, but I will keep trying to find a good mixture of wet/dry that is not prone to cause UTI problems.  In sum, one should always read the lower star reviews also, because there are kernels of truth and guidance to be found in some of those reviews, and good reasons for some buyers to at least, Think, Consider & Beware!  It may be a great product for some and not so great for others, but one needs to be aware of the potential pitfalls and ramifications, and choose carefully, and not just rely solely on the 5 star reviews.",0
"Sheesh, I have a ton of Frisbee's now! This is so light it goes nowhere! Plus it tends to go either right or left, not straight at all! Uber light!",0
"This ball turned weird and cakey texture. It left pink rubber all over the place, and then after I washed it, it was chalky and discolored. The smell is weird too. My dogs never played with it.",0

"When I got the product, it worked great!! My snake was definitely worried about the fog until she got used to it (then she seemed to thoroughly enjoy it even).
I have only been using it for a week, and the fan broke inside it so it still produces fog but the fog will not leave the machine. The manufacturer is no help either, no replies to my emails to the support email provided, including the one I sent to register my warranty when I first got it.  Not I have a broken fogger after less than 25 hours of use and no way to get a replacement. Great product in theory but no manufacturer support to back it up.",0
As advertised. Will buy from again.,1
My dogs seemed to be feeling a little better but then got sick again. Worms in the poo. Not effective.,0
We use most all types of purina pro plan adult cat food and it seems to be good for our cats.  we also use the dry cat food they sell.  However this is the worst smelling cat food I we have ever used!  Can hardly stand to have it open in the kitchen.  Cats barely eat it also.,0
Bought these as a gift for my equestrian friend for Christmas and she loves them. Good to use as a curry comb and they're great for shedding in the spring because of the rubbery material.,1

"Update: The quality of this hay has gone down. I had to order another batch from another vendor, because my bunny was not interested in eating the Jojo's. Sadly, the Jojo's went in my green yard waste cart. The last two boxes I order were mostly yellow old stems. The hay looked really old and dried out. My daughter who also orders from them said she is finding the same lower quality with her orders.  I wonder what is going on over there?

My bunny loves this hay! She is always so happy when she sees me refilling her feed basket with fresh hay. Definitely has helped to keep my bunny's digestion regulated and healthy!! This hay is far superior then the stuff you get at the pet stores.

Update: Unfortunately the price has gone up on this product. Bummer!!",0
Both my dog Chloe and I like this product.  Only problem was that I didn't realize that I had to assemble it completely.,1
Fits my car well..just a little long for the seat but that was expected as my seat measured 52inches and this stated 56 inches,1
The bottom shelf was broken and the cat tree is unstable when assembled. My cat is only 9 months and he does not fit into the small hideaway or use the car tree at all because it is wobbly.,0
"My 3 Boston Terriers LOVE these treats!  They are natural, wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces.  We keep a steady supply of them in the house ...

"The treats arrived in tiny pieces, poor shipping

Mostly powder",0
"This was okay, but I accidentally ordered a size small and needed a size extra small.  I couldn't send it back, or I could have actually, but it would have cost more to send it than the cost of the harness itself, so I kept it instead.  It comes directly from China, so if you order this product, make sure you order the correct size for your pet.  I am now stuck with a harness that is too big for my dog, with a collar that is just right as well as the lead, but the wrong size harness.  Darn.",0
Great,1
"I have 3 of these shelves, one for each cat.  They were easy to install, and they are easy to clean.  Smoky, Lily and Toby give them a firm paws up!",1

ok,0
Terrible quality. Received it broken. Very flimsy and unstable. Will likely end up throwing it away.,0
Perfect! Just what we needed for our babies!  Great quality!!,1
Use to put the other crap on my dog's back every month and still found ticks. All for an arm and half a leg($$.$$)! Now I buy these! Replace every 3 months... No residue to worry about... Cost a fraction of the cost compared to the alternative... And I haven't found any ticks since. You'd be a fool not to at least try it.....,1
Super cute and I love how easy it is to put on. Wish the snap closer wasn't as loose when the harness is on. It does make along of noise which my little guy is still getting used to,1
"Our dog isn't very hard on toys, but she was able to tear these apart within a few days.",0
"Tried it with my two dogs---nothing, As i pressed the button, they just sat there, no movement what so ever--I had it right up to their noses--nothing!!  Took it on my walk, again, no reaction from the neighborhood dogs.  Only thing that does work--is the red light!  So if you like to push a button and see a red light--then this is your gadget!!  Such a pretty red light!!  2 thumbs down otherwise!!

Update:  Sent it back and they refunded my $$$",0
lids don't fit all cans.  I will start throwing them away.  they split and are hard to put on.,0
Love it!,1
"UPDATE:
Got one of these bags busted open inside the shipping box today, and it appears as though the only way to get a refund would be to ship the mess back.  Not fun.  I'm taking the loss this time, but I'm definitely switching to a litter with better packaging.  You should too.

Old review 4/5:

Noticed just a little matting on my cat's paw, so maybe not great for long haired cats.

Really good volume for the weight and a good price.",0

"Our four year-old, 65 pound Rhodesian Ridgeback loved this bed from the moment it came out of the box. She'd scratched through the covers of several other beds and shredded their stuffing, but she doesn't seem to need to scratch at this because of the cozy acrylic ""lambswool"" top. This is her favorite bed so far and the first time I ever wrote a product review. It's soft, well-stuffed, and well-made. I haven't washed it yet but I'm ordering a second bed so she can have one in her crate and one in her favorite sunny spot. Great product! And made in the USA!",1
"My dogs don't love getting these boots on, but once they are on they do fine. The boots are excellent at preventing irritation from salted sidewalks and roads in winter. They can also be used to protect bandages. We have found them to have pretty good durability but you will definitely need to replace them at least a couple of times each winter.",1
"This is a nice feeder for larger birds. The opening is smaller than the old one I bought years ago and the walls are a bit thinner although adequate. The finish is nice. The one complaint I have is that the metal clamp is flimsy. The metal is too thin and bends easily. It could easily pull through a cage with 1"" bar spacing. You can either replace it with something thicker you make or get some fender washers from a hardware store.",1
This is a great training treat for any dog.  My dogs love them.  They aren't too hard so my older dog has no problems chewing on them.,1
"Awesome leash. Have had it for a year and a half, using it at least twice a day for an 85 lb dog. Would definitely buy another. This one is holding up well though. No frays.",1
"I had high hopes for this item but in the end was very let down. I have two dachshunds that like to bark at every little sound.  I thought this would be an easy way to train them to stop the excessive barking.  Unfortunately it did not quite have the results I'd hoped for.  Both of my dogs could hear the sound and both reacted very differently.

My full size 12 yr old dachshund was scared beyond belief.  She would either run and hide under the bed for the following few hours or curl up in my lap and refuse to move.  For the next few weeks, anytime my other dog would bark, she would run and hide, even though I hadn't pressed the button.

My mini dachshund puppy also could hear it because I would see his head tilt to the size when I pressed the button. He would then go on to continue barking. Sometimes he would actually bark MORE after I pressed it.

I ultimately returned the item for a full refund.",0
"Good idea, but my big dog ripped them off in 30 seconds",0
Will it fit a humans neck,1
"I left basically this same review under the Natures Miracle product in which I gave a one star:

Recently decided to clean my carpets as I just got a new puppy. I wanted to pretreat any unrine stains/spots before I decided to use my new Hoover Steamvac (also just purchased from Amazon). Took out my old trusty blacklight and found that the previous owners of my condo must have had a dog/cat because pee stains were all over the condo and in every bedroom (haven't had my pup long enough for her to do it) Anyway I tried the Simple Solution enzyme cleaner on a couple of the stains and it worked ok but I needed something stronger. Bought 2 of the 1.5 gallon Nature's Miracle and totally soaked the stains in two of my rooms using both 1.5 gallons! I wanted the smell gone so I followed I did as the instructions said and it still smelled pretty much the same after. Then after reading some reviews I came accross another reviewer who said that a product called Odormute was good and much cheaper http://www.amazon.com/Ryter-Odormute-Eliminator-Concentrate-Unscented/dp/B0002D3250/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1336230826&sr=1-1
so I bought some and it arrived yesterday, I mixed it up in a ""garden sprayer"" making it double the concentration the instructions said. Soaked both rooms again, and let it sit for an hour. Went back over it with the hoover steamvac, not in cleaning mode but just to suck up all the water and solution. Let it dry overnight and to my surprise the smell was gone and neutral (since the odormute I purchased was scentless) I highly recommed it and it was soooooo much cheaper than all the other enzyme cleaners I have wasted my money on. Going to soak my 2 Large shag rugs in it tomorrow and pressure wash them out! Very excited someone recommended another product on their review!!!!",1
"MUST BE BALANCED unless your dog is asleep. Even a couple ounces will make it flop to one side. But, I'm not sure you can do anything about it other than balance it. We put four bottles of water in...take one out of each side, that sort of thing. And don't overload the dog. 20% of body weight MAX...just like humans with packs. Better is 10%",1
"Our lab loves these ears and the price is reasonable comparatively, but I do wish they lasted longer.",1
Batteries go quick.  Recommend you buy backups with initial purchase of collar.,1
"I agree with the negative comments of most 1-star reviewers.  I wanted to love this system, but one of our cats refused to defecate in the system.  I called their help center to explain the problem and was promised that after a review by their specialists that someone would respond with a suggestion or just a response of some kind.  No one from Purina ever responded and it has been 2.5 months since my initial call.  I called after waiting one month and was told that my inquiry was still open and pending.  I presume that there was no call back because there is a failure rate for this product and, in our case, no plausible solution -- and they wouldn't want to confirm that, if true.  I am disappointed that Purina, however, did not respond as promised and promoted -- even if there is no potential solution in some situations.",0
No stomach issues.  Dogs love. I use one can mixed in a blender with about a half a can of water.  This provides enough yum to all 3 of my large dogs with out killing my wallet.,1
My children (dogs) love these snacks so I keep a large supply on hand,1
Great purchase and keeps all the cat stuff inside (no mess) - love it!,1
"Good quality - it has two squeakers in it and lasted a while with our dog who is notorious for ripping apart ANY toy! Not to mention, my dog is absolutely adorable carrying around a little donut!",1
"This will be the 6th year that my Christmas Holiday card features my two Shitzu/Malteese mix darlings. I usually go for the regular santa or elf outfits with hats. For some reason, I wasn't expecting these to be much. I am very, very impressed. The fabric has a nice stretch to it, and as noted earlier, the quality is the best. They are both around 11lbs, and size medium fits as though it was tailor-made.",1
"Catches 75% of the mess my dirty little beast creates. After dropping $30 on another mat that capture less, I am happy as a lark with this mat.",1
This is very disappointing.  The product is too flimsy for the height. The base should have been made wider to provide stabilization.  The Faux Fur is a cheap thin fabric that will be destroyed in no time at all.  The top perches are too small for any medium-size cat to sleep on. It was easy to assemble  and will be just as easy unassembled. I plan on putting this back in the box and sending it back.,0
"Horrible experience! Perimeter stitching was terrible, not to mention two out of the three webbing supports, located just underneath the mesh, designed to provide support in those areas, were completely missing. The stitching in these particular areas were ripped, as if these supports we're ripped away. For the money, I'd expect better quality!",0
"Came with no perch Im so Fcking mad, in the picture its showing but doesnt have it...",0
"I got these for a white elephant gift for Christmas. When they showed up I realize that it was a waste of money. I know their dog toys but they are really poor quality, looks terrible, and have no crinkle to them (like the description says).
I have not seen  the dogs play with them yet  but I have no doubt they would be torn apart in minutes.
You would be much better off just going to the Dollar Store and getting twice as much for your money.",0
"This bed is barely water proof if not at all. If you drop only a few water drops on them then maybe they will roll off. Otherwise, if the dog pees in his bed, it will soak through.",0
My dogs love it!  When it arrived I went ahead and gave all three of my Mals some just to try it out and they couldn't get enough. When Bella my female Alaskan Malamute is pregnant she tends to not want to eat her dog food most of her pregnancy so I bought this and I will update on if she still likes it when she is pregnant.,1
"My siberian husky ""Rocco"" just luvs these treats. What a way to treat ur best friend, with a healthy brand u can trust. Amazon prime is great with delivery. And the treats were fresh still. Thanks",1

"Occasionally we absentmindedly lock our cat in the living room when we go to bed.  We always call the dogs out, but sometimes the cat is hiding.  So, she pees on the rug.  This stuff is so great.  A pleasant, not strong fragrance, and it really does work.  What a name!  Great for Icky Poo!",1
I purchased the Cat Mate Magnets hoping they would be a stronger magnet than the PetSafe Magnet I currently have to operate a PetSafe Magnetic  Cat Door.  I ran a test by lifting different weight tools I have with both the Cat Mate and PetSafe Magnets.  The magnetic pulling power of the The PetSafe magnet I currently have has a MUCH STRONGER magnetic pull than the Cat Mate magnet.  I would highly recommend purchasing the PetSafe magnet instead of the Cat Mate magnet.,0
"Good quality, and its attractive.  Its great. I just hope my little one year old dog doesnt chew it apart as she has on many others.",1
Overpriced but a necessity.,0
We have taken this stroller out with my 28 pound dog 3 times.  Every time the tires went flat and we had to take the dog out sit on the ground and pump up the tires with an air pump included.  Parts are included to mount this air pump but when we called to find out where to mount it we were told to just throw it away.  It is hard to push and gets stuck going in one direction. Customer service is HORRIBLE.  Wish we would have tried it before 30 days were up.  Too late to send back.  Actually zero stars,0
"These harness run small, very small",0
"Easy to put on my dog & remove it. Fits nicely, he weighs 10 pounds. I feel like he is much safer when he pulls on the leash.",1

Better for small dog under 25 lbs.",1
Love this color on my white Westie!,1
"My dog hates this bag but then again, she hates being confined. I on the hand LOVE it! I fly a few times a year and when I do I like to take my 9 pound Yorkshire terrier with me. So far, this bag has not let me down. I brought the large one and it has fit under under the seat of every flight I have taken, which at the moment includes Southwest (fits best under the middle aisle), American, Delta and United (tight fit in the smaller planes). What I love most about the bag is the pocket in the back. It holds a lot of things (e.g., doggie's medical records, treats, travel bowl for water and medication to calm her down) and does not add bulk to the bag.

On caveat, the first bag I purchased was defective but Amazon quickly sent me another one. I have had the replacement bag since 2012 and four years later it is still going strong. Definitely worth the money.",1
We have this and several other slow feeder bowls and our dogs love this one and a larger orange version the best!,1
"I like this because it does not add artificial perfume or anything to cover the dog smell but rather just removed the dog smell gradually or odor control. It helped a lot between washes or when guests visit. I used it on my 3 month old, 3 LB puppy and it does not seem to bother his skin. I used it once or twice a week. I will get other products from Nature Miracle!",1
this is good to have when you have an elderly dog and they are not feeling well! it came in briefly and it was packaged nicely. I would recommend any dog owner to have this handy incase of anything,1
Exactly what I needed and at a good price highly recommended,1
"After having the container for one month, the container lid would close but was no longer air tight. I had to throw out an entire 40lbs bag of dog food. This was a waste and a disappointment.",0
Feels like a quality product but didn't stand up to a dachshund. He was able to push thru the zipper on top and tore through mesh within minutes. This is also a dog that never chews things. I would strongly urge against purchasing if you have a dog that might not want to be in the cage. I was only able to use it once.,0

Bought to use to keep my cat out of my bedroom; huge fail. This gate will in no way keep a cat out of any room. A full grown cat can easily fit through the bars and even jump over it. Waste of money. The seller should call this a lazy dog gate instead of featuring a cat in the picture for the product.,0
works well....now I just have to try and keep dog still enough to use it,1
Love how it clumps but very dusty. Prefer arm and hammer,0
"does not stay in place
ferrett will easily turn it over!",0
"No stars. Great idea but not a product I would trust to take over the feeding process.

I really tried. I loved the idea and really liked the company's efforts but this should never have been out of the beta phase the way it is currently. My dog lost a ton of weight. Unfortunately, he was not being fed enough... sometimes not at all. I use wellness core and the food is small enough but it just doesn't spit out enough. The first time I set it it looked like enough. I monitored it for a few days until I felt confident that it would be right for my pet. Over time I found that was not the case. After noticing my dogs overall size was getting smaller, I started monitoring it again to find out that it was not spitting out the food. I gave it a good shake and pressed the manual feed button to then find that it was too small and definitely nowhere near the cups I was expecting. I have had to adjust it twice to increase the feeding size and then the amount of times it spits food out. Still giving me issues, dog still not being fed enough.

I've had enough. I'm moving on for the safety of my pet. I am very frustrated and disappointed because I wanted this to work. I would suggest anyone with one should discontinue use.",0
Sparky really enjoys these chewies.  I have occasionally found them in my laundry basket so I know that he likes them and saves them for a special occasion.  They are a good quality rawhide product which last quite a long time considering their size.  When Sparky runs through them I plan to purchase them again.,1
Love this thing. Just use it to remove the tiniest tick. Was amazed at how quickly the tick came off. So easy.,1
"Would give 5 stars if they were just a little more heavy duty, but for the price, can't beat them! My cats both still have claws and do put some holes in the liners. But they have made my life so much easier and I will continue to purchase them!",1
"Super thin. Washable, though.",0
Love my dryer,1
"It is very cute and funny, but my bulldog chewed it up right away. Thank goodness he did not eat the pieces he chewed off!",0
This has not worked! My bird is still plucking.,0
broke in a week,0
"These are not ""professional""!  I expected these clippers to be very sharp.  very disappointed!",0
It's perfect. I can keep that in the glove box so if I don't have her vest handy she is still easily identified as a service dog.,1
"My cats' toy balls are bigger than this! Definitely not worth the $, very disappointed.",0
leaks . . . huge mess!,0
The handles won't stay in place!  The rake broke of on the third use..  This isn't even worth five dollars which is probably what it cost to make it.  Save you money!!,0
"Our neighbors have a grunting pig toy for their dog.  It's heavy duty rubber and the dogs play with it all the time without it ripping or breaking.  This pig toy looks the same but it isn't - the quality on this one is horrible.  It has much thinner plastic and the squeaker broke within the first 2 hours with normal dog play.  Overall, not remotely durable and not worth the money.",0
Maybe I got a dud but this bowl is in no way waterproof. We are currently driving cross country and at our first rest stop I pour some water in the bowl for my pup and within seconds the entire bowl is soaking wet and a puddle is forming around it. I am extremely disappointed in this product,0
"Lasted about two days until my dog  had it shredded, he is big time chewer so this was actually pretty amazing it lasted that long",1
"Just as the title says. Did not work. It smells really awful, is messy and hard to apply and my dog freaked out at the sight of the bottle. Read this review on a product that will really work for Hot Spots and other wounds/aliments.

"Poor product... The quality is not consistent. I have to look for other brand hay now.

Attached a picture. All yellow hard uneatable pieces. It took me 5 mins to pick these  out. The whole bag is full of these yellow and dry out stems. Only 1/4 bag eatable i think.

So don't try your luck if you care your pigs.",0
"Been tweaking their diet a bit and it seems my ferrets REALLY like the taste of this food. I mix it with both Marshall's and Wysong epigen, with a nightly supplement of Evangers chicken (canned).  They've had some stomach issues because I've added to their diet though. I think that's beginning to pass. They had started off with just regular Marshalls, but I've found that a blend gives them better nutritional support.  The Evangers canned they'll lick their bowl clean. The Wysong gives them a healthy coat, and they love the taste of Mazuri. But of course they still have a taste for Marshalls too. Expensive little beasts, but worth it.  Finding the perfect blend has been challenging to say the least.",1
This is slow but works really well if you chill out and let it. I use it on a 5 gallon tank.,1
my dog looks so cute in this!,1
"I have depended on this item for years and when it works, it is terrific. We could plan on a machine lasting a year and order another replacement ahead of time. But when it doesn't last...  There is one metal part that breaks pretty consistently on nearly every machine, the one and only weld.  Then there are problems that come up with the timer not working as it should. Then there are the loose broken parts inside the damaged shipping box that come into question. What I blame for many of the problems with the machine is the way it is packaged for shipment. Not so much the machine. It is all alone to shift and get smashed inside a paper box and gets broken enroute. That is not the fault of the customer who gets a broken machine that doesn't last like it is suppose to. So what happens? You spend your money and order another one sooner than you should have to. I contacted the company I bought the last one from and they replaced the bottom portion of the faulty machine but shipped it in yet another paper box with no styrofoam that would assure better shipment so the shipping box top had a  hole smashed over the metal bar and the plastic base was broken. I was offered a return of $15. I paid hard earned money for a brand new machine that works, not two broken ones and a $15 refund offer. The machine does its job if it isn't already broken when you receive it.",1
"I love the quality of these chews. I bought them hoping my cats would like them and that chewing them would help with plaque build up ( vet said my boy had quite a bit of plaque). The girl cat loves these and chews them instantly;however, my boy, and main concern, will not chew on them at all.that being said, he doesnt chew on much of anything, even the cat rope on their cat tower. I will order them again.",1
Company is very great to work with. Great item for longer hair animals.,1
The light burnt out in just weeks.,0
Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  My small dog still barks sometimes.,0
Was not strong enough to kill the fleas. I used the Soresto collar after and it worked immediately.,0
My cat loves this food. And again it is delivered right to my door.,1
"I was so hopeful that this was a miracle stain remover!! After using almost everything on the market for my Maltese's tear stains, I saw this and the 5 star reviews. I have been using this daily for almost 6 weeks and there is no change in the color of her tear stains. I clean her eyes daily anyway because they tend to get crusty but using this was a waste. I wish My dog had the results that most of the reviewers had.",0
Expensive!,0
This product isn't safe for small children - or those who may eat small batteries.,0
My cats love this flavor and I love that it's grain free!,1
"Our cat Chloe loves the Arch! She rubs her face on it and sits in the middle of it and likes to play chase games with the Arch as home base, It's a hit!",1
"Is this a joke whistle?  It sounds like a train conductor whistle, and my dog coudn't care less.  This is NOT a dog whistle, it just looks like one.  It is NOT an ultrasonic whistle as the description states.  Stupid product, have to return and order a real dog whistle now, waste of time.",0
"I bought this cage from another website, and was a bit nervous seeing as the manufacturer is not well-known. But I got the cage quickly and it was easy to assemble. There were some bent parts (including a hinge for one of the bowl doors) but they were easily bent back with no cracking paint or coating. It was no biggie in the end. The cage is sturdy and looks great in my house. Even better, my bird loves it. It is so spacious for her - I bought this giant cage for a green cheek conure. That's what makes it truly giant. But she makes use of the entire cage. Family says it is her ""Taj Mahal"" palace. She is a small bird, but it works great for her. She is never bored - the options are endless for toys and perches. The cage is just about the same height as me (I am 5'2""). I don't use the play top a lot, as she has a separate playstand and I like to keep her below shoulder-height for training purposes. But even at my short height, the door is too short. It's difficult to hang toys at times for having to crouch down to reach in and simultaneously grab the attachment for the toy on the top of the cage. I wish the door went to the top - that's my only real complaint about this cage.

That and I wish I could buy a replacement perch for the inside - the one that was provided with the cage was great!",1
"My medium haired cat hates this thing. He attacks it when I try to brush him with it. And to make it even worse, no hair comes off him! What a waste of money.",0
"worked fine, but stopped working...terrible...wirhin 3 mos",0
"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly.",1
"Had no trouble putting it in the cage, seems secure and easier to use.  I'm just not sure my African Grey has got the hang of foraging toys yet.  I've put in various kinds of toys over the last year and had only minimal luck, but he's young so I figure I will keep trying.  He did open one of the squares to get a peanut, but the other 3 remain untouched.  The star missing may be more due to my birds attitude than the quality of the toy, but I'm just still looking for a toy that will get him interested in the whole foraging toy world.",1
"I assume this is a quality product, but there's nothing SOFT about these. I had to give them away to the neighbors dog.",0
My cats love this soft food.,1
"This was very easy to put together. However, I would NEVER place any animal in this product and put them out in the elements. We purchased this item for indoor and occasional use on our front porch (roof over top). The hutch is rickety and moves around. We have not had a problem with urine leaking ( our rabbit is potty trained ) but I can see were others are having this problem. Overall this hutch is poorly made and is definitely NOT good for use outside!! Think about what and where you will use this for BEFORE purchasing.",0
Only used on cat a few times. Was worried about licking and not getting from vet. Used all natural spray instead to be safe.,0
"My dog loves this food. Unfortunately, it's obviously VERY high in fat content since he's gained weight like crazy, and his coat has dulled so much since he's been on it. We're done with it now.",0
"We walk one of our dogs off-leash in the woods and we like to know he won't be mistaken for a deer or some other animal a hunter might shoot.  There's no mistaking him for a wild animal now that he's sporting his bright ""yellow"" vest (which is more like a 'lemon-lime' color).  We don't use the pockets for poo bags, but we do have him carry his own leash which we keep in one of the pockets.  I would recommend a few changes to the manufacturer (like using better zipper hardware - we lost one of the zipper pulls the first week we received it, and the buckle should have been attached closer to the edge of the vest material for easier access) but otherwise, it works well and the reflective tape on the vest really shows up well when you hit it with a light source.
Would definitely purchase again....but I hope this lasts so I don't have to!",1
cat seems to like it,1
Cats reluctant to use it as it only has one way in and out.  Cats don't like to be trapped.,0
"Purchased this for my new Persian cat who got neutered about a year ago. He was able to feed and drink with ease. Once healed I started using this cone when I groom him because he likes to bite, especially when I trim his paws. Fits his neck perfectly and cannot reach my arm while I trim his paws. I love that it is washable and re-usable.",1
I ordered 2 of these & 1 arrived broken & the other 1 lasted a couple hours....disappointed & had to return them,0
"I purchased the product because it didn't require batteries.  It runs on an electric adapter.  I wanted the capability of ""unplugging"" the device after work hours.  The Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device did not help to control my older dog's barking.  In the past, I didn't mind her alerting us to visitors; but I moved my office to my home recently and I really need her to be quiet during work hours.  I thought she had good hearing?.?  The sound emitted just didn't phase her at all. The device looks cheap, but has the features I wanted: high/low frequency, can run outside, and audible/inaudible to human settings. She is a cocker/sheltie mix.  Maybe it would work better on a younger dog?.?  I don't think this device would last outside in a MN winter(below zero).",0
Right size for my puppy and also it help with training him.,1
"I honestly don't know why any cat would spend even two minutes on this bed I threw it next to the dumpester, I doud anyone will take it",0
I tried this headcollar on my bouncy Shiba Inu and she did not like it at all.  The quality was nice and it was easy to fit.  Once I had it on her she would not budge - even with her training clicker and treats.  We tried several different sessions and she would walk a few feet and then flatten to the ground in her muzzle of shame.  We will stick with our SENSE-ation halter.,0
2 months expired on delivery,0
Toy is cute. Personally do not think it was worth $14.99. Squeaker is broke. Not worth keeping.,0
"We used Angel Eyes a couple of years ago and it worked great.  We are trying it again with no results.  I do not know if it is because this time we are using the sweet potato variety.  Still hoping it will help, but it has been awhile.",0
My dog won't eat her food without this stuff!,1
My puppies still bark I don't know that its really working that well . I wished I wouldnt have wasted my money on this,0
"I returned this product for a number of reasons.  What initially appealed to me about this harness is that the apple green one I purchased appeared in the photo to be lined with a white fleece.  My vet recommended I look for a white harness or collar for my 12lb chihuahua-terrier mutt, as her skin is easily irritated.  He said that she might be reacting to the dyes in her harnesses and collars (he also said that leather isn't a solution, because the chemicals used to tan it can have the same effect).  I think there was one white harness listed on Amazon at the time I purchased this and it looked too big, so I seized upon white fleece lining as an option.  When my Planet Dog harness arrived and it was 100% green, lining and all, I was disappointed.  But I tried it on my dog anyway and adjusted the straps because the fleece is really, really soft and I thought that the softness might be easier on her skin.  Unfortunately, the the piece that lets you adjust the circumference of the chest band is made of a thin metal (other reviewers have mentioned this). It hit right at my dog's armpit and it would have been animal cruelty to subject her to that sharp, awkwardly large metal thing hitting her tender little chest every time she took a step.

In summary:The apple green harness is lined with green fleece, not white as it appeared on my monitor.  The metal adjuster thing should be scrapped by the company, it sucks.  Also, the scale of this harness just does not appear to work for small dogs.  The straps are just a little too wide, which means you need bigger hardware.  Again, I just cannot get over how stupid it is to take a potentially nice, soft harness and ruin it with cheap, uncomfortable, badly placed hardware. Maybe try this if you have  a bigger dog.",0
"Unreliable - two out of the 4 pumps are intermittent with the central drive shaft spinning at random times in the center of the three planetary lobes. Replaced one of the pumps with the spare head provided and the same result. Will return. Read the other negative reviews and almost all of these refer to the same issue (pump stuck or not turning). The manual is not great as there is clearly a language problem but one can get through it with some fiddling with the controls. Ultimately, I found that the programming was straightforward and relatively easy. I was able initially to calibrate all four pumps to the standard 100ml and found on subsequent testing that the delivery at 25ml, 25ml and 6ml on three of the heads was right on the money (within 1ml). Too bad so now back to the drawing board.",0
Pups won't pee in yard when it rains so I got this for the patio. They love it! They still go in yard too.,1
Bought it for a French Bulldog lasted approx. 30 minutes.  Then he had foam everywhere.  Very disappointed.........,0
"I read reviews for the Flexi leash calling it the BMW of leashes and other accolades. First off it's fairly heavy which is a good sign, the recoil was aggressive and I though could be problematic but I acclimated. Three weeks later the BMW of leashes is jammed. The screw holes are so small that I needed to go buy a special screw driver to fix it so instead of spending another eight bucks, plus my time, I returned the BMW of leashes.",0
This leash has broken - the straps around the metal rings have almost completely eroded away. I was told not to get the black one by friends who had experienced this but I guess the pink one has the same issue :/,0
My cat is pretty particular and he really liked this food. There were no problems in making the switch and we're almost through the first bag and he's had no spit ups the entire time which he would occassionally have with other foods. We will be ordering another bag today.,1
Great size for big cats,1
way too big,0
Will be requesting a refund/exchange.  It came unsealed and was all all the box and other orders. Disappointed. Will update review when I get a bottle that is actually sealed.,0
This product lasted one and a half month before I had to replace it.  I'm not even sure if it worked in the first place as I never could confirm my dog got shocked when it crossed the wire.  Ive replaced it with a more expensive model that seems to be working great.  Dont buy this product it is not worth the postage paid to have it sent to me.,0
"I bought this for my Birman kitten and three years later this is still her favorite toy! She tosses this up in the air and bats it around, she carries it around in her mouth and hides it all over the house but mostly in her bed. The quality is excellent and is still in excellent condition after three years of everyday use! The rattle noise is nice addition too. This is a second purchase of the same toy for her new babycat brother on the way.",1
"A kind gentlemen at PetCo (I order from Amazon due to the fact its A. cheaper, and B. a 90 mile drive to the closest Pet Store) took the time to go through all the brands available and he recommended Blue Buffalo Hands down.  I can't thank him enough!  our vizsla is gaining weight rapidly, (muscle not fat - she is a vizsla after all) looks healthy as can be, and loves her food : )  As a very active puppy it gives her all the energy she needs which is very important.  We have never had her throw up or have runny stools.  We will never buy anything but Blue Buffalo.  As a side note we give her Blue Buffalo Yogart Health Bars for treats and she loves, loves, loves them and occasionally add in some canned Blue Buffalo puppy food.",1
"Received it after weeks of waiting. There was a STRONG smell of plastic when you open it & instead of being a yellow bowl, mine had random spots of blue dye all over.",0
The invincible squeaker didn't hold up! It only squeaked a couple times and then was done!,0
"There are no grommets as were advertised, the fabric is very thin and I find it difficult to keep the sides down at all as there is nothing to secure them. I'm confident in the sta-put devices keeping the hammock from coming out of the seat, but for the rest of it I wish I hadn't wasted my money and had just gone with the regular bench seat cover - maybe then I wouldn't feel so ripped off.",0
too noisy,0
My Great Dane ripped this cover in half within the first hour of placing it in her crate with her.  Very disappointing. It's basically regular denim jeans in the shape of a dog bed,0
"This is an excellent product, well worth the price, and easy to put together.  My kittens play, climb, catapult on this all the time and that has helped to protect my furniture!  Even my 14 year old ""big boned"" kitty surprised me and climbed up to the top! They all will sleep on it as well. I just wish I had bought one for my older kitties in the past! I looked at many products at different sites, and found the best price on Amazon.",1
"I would  not order this. My dog pushes it out of the way so that she's under it, so it must be hot. It also sheds and I have little white balls everywhere.",0
"The product itself is good - I love the Tidy Cats litter. However, the ridiculous price Amazon is now selling it at is very disappointing so I will not be buying this again through Amazon until they drop the price back down again.",0
I am so disappointed. I love this hoodie. It is really adorable and for my pup well. Unfortunately in the first two days the white detailing was already falling off.,0
Crap. Deceptive advertising. Absolute rip off. Three elk bones for $71. Only someone who didn't pay attention to what they were buying would order this!!!,0

"I kept my turtles outdoors but finally decided to move them in and looked at this figured it was perfect for it, but the wattage is too low. Sure my mistake but unless you keep a small setup, you will need to keep these bulbs around 6-8 inches to be effective. Even at close proximity of 6 inches, the basking area only got to around 85f. I would suggest 75w so it's not too close..unless that's what you preffer.",0
"Cute, t-shirt. What I expected",1
These were never available anywhere!  I thought they stopped making them.  Thank you for keeping Happy happy!  He LOVES them!,1
My cat loves this kitty seat. She is 8 lbs and so far the velcro has held up!,1
A vet-tech friend recommended this product for my yorkies dry eye but unfortunately this product does little to keep the mucus (gunk) clear from her eyes and makes her head and around her eyes very greasy. Rather unpleasant.,0
My cat didn't like this food. His stools smelled horrible. He became very agressive. He was biting and scratching. When we changed him back to Science diet  he became nicer.,0
I have spent 4 and half hours putting this cage together wth 2 people...that shows you how hard it is to set it up and like everyone said the directions were basically non-existent! The cage has 4 small doors I don't understand how I would clean it there is no place to hang anything up like a nest or lighting..and only 2 perches for this huge cage it's ridiculous  I don't recommend this cage if you wanna save your money,0
"I bought this to prevent my pug from marking all over the house.  Unfortunately, he had managed to get this belly band off - he just rubbed his body against the wall and kitchen cabinets until it slid off.  I like this design much better than the diapers with elastic (Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap), but those are much more functional for the purpose - they actually stay on the dogs, lol.",0
Guys this stand is great. I have a 73 pound pitbull that would lay on his belly to eat but not anymore. This is a perfect elevated bowl for a pit or big tall like German shepherd .. I would recommend placing it against the wall or a corner to keep it from moving while they are eating from it. Also the style is pretty. Obviously he's not in the picture lol but look how big it is alongside my adult cat.. Love it!,1
"I bought a Kugo hammock 3 years ago and it was great. Bought one from Amazon a few months ago to replace it and the manufacturer had decided to replace the snaps on the ends with something they call a ""bunge cord"". A tiny pice of elastic cord would be more accurate. They also removed the plastic loops that I had used to fasten down the ends of the hammock next to each door. There is no way they could have considered this change an improvement. Maybe they save .50 each in manufacturing cost. Whenever my dog jumps into the truck, if her feet do not clear the edge, they catch and she gets reluctant to jump in next time.
Go to the old way and I'd buy another but not as long as there is no way to firmly secure the ends.",0
I had a small door for the cats and my poor dog got stuck in it so now the cats and dog both use this one and everybody is happy.,1
Real bad waited more then 4 weeks.,0
Buyer be ware for fault advertise! This item was made in China. I disappointed it. I cannot trust any Chinese made products for my fishes.,0
"Too thin, our puppy pulls them apart.",0

"I have two short hair cats. Not much hair comes off of my black cat's coat, but I gets TONS within seconds using this brush on my gray cat. I think he must have a dense under layer which is really what this brush works best for. He actually doesn't like getting brushed at all and tries to bite the brush. But he's easily distracted with food, treats, or another toy so I'm able to brush him for at least a few minutes and get a lot of excess fur off. Definitely happy with this purchase and would recommend!",1
"My dog LOVES these! I have all three sizes. I just recently switched to the small one, since it's harder for my pup to get the treats out... and that means more play time. These are incredibly sturdy balls. My dog is a chihuahua mix and destroys everything! She's even chewed up a DVD. But all of these KONG balls remain intact. Highly recommend this company for durable toys.",1
So I was hesitant buying this return pump.. I would rate this 5 stars for the product because its amazing. However Im giving this a 1 star because per web page this product was to be delivered new. I got it today and the box was SO beat up.. ripped.. opened.. taped all over. Such a shame to receive a product in this condition.,0
"I just received this about 3 hours ago.  It is just what I expected, fits my needs perfectly and my fish are happy to be out of the dark.  Easy to set up, several ways.  I used the suction cups.  Very happy with this item.",1
"I am extremely disappointed at they changed the ingredient and the protein source!! I have feed my dogs S&C for over 3 years! Start from last June, they suddenly have diarrhea and soft and black stool. I changed to other brand, and their stool back to normal. I thought it's just occasionally, so I changed back to S&C. It didn't get better. I checked online, they add Pea fiber and Menadione sodium bisulfate to the food. It's HARMFUL to your pets! DON'T get it! It's very very bad.",0
eselemte,1
Works well on my 75 lb Boxer!,1
"The blue band certainly secures nicely around my Mastiff/Plott Hound's abdomen well enough. The issue comes with the non-adjustable length of the handles, and how very long they are. When I lift his backside to climb the steps, the poor thing is, despite my efforts, swinging and teetering back and forth from his backside, while frantically trying to claw his way forward.
If I weren't trying to help him up the stairs, it would be very comical to watch. He does, however, have an amusing expression of ""Aw gawd, oh crud, oh, crud, Lawd help meh!!"" expression on his face as he's trying to make it forward.",0
Measured girth and neck.  Size chart says medium.  Purchased medium per chart.  It is fine except too small to go over her head. Oh Well.  Neighbors dog will get lucky.  Next time will do the local Walmart visit.,0
"I barely used this product, maybe for like 2 weeks not continuously. I pulled it out the other day and I won't hold a charge so it no longer works. I basically paid for a training collar to use maybe at most 3 times and now I can't use it anymore. I also can't find any information on the company so I can't contact them to get in touch with how to replace it (there is no number or contact information placed in the directions or the box, and well as not being able to find this information on line). Waste of money. Not happy with this product.",0
Mice won't touch it,0
Very heavy to carry. Two bars were not sodier properly. Hard time lining up tray bottom of cage.  I use for my travel cage not every day use.,0
too flimsy for the money. Had to tie it on to the old one.,0
"This is a great little setup other than the fact it is NOT 52"" tall. It is 38"" tall with a 14"" canopy ridge (which I am not using since it'll be used indoors. This should not be counted as height since I was looking for a unit where the actual height was 48"" min. A bit of false advertising. Complicating returning, we'll see if my dogs end up jumping it or not.",0
This didn't help at all. I bought it because one of my dogs has stomach problems and all 3 dogs have gas. They stink up my house. Anyhow this didn't help.,0
Love the product but hate that they didn't tape the tops closed for shipment.  Half of the shampoo from two of the bottles of shampoo had leaked out and was a gooey mess on the bottom of the box.  I had to fish out the shpampoo bottles from the gooey mess.,1
"My kitten loves this thing so much that, after a couple hours, I have to put it away for a rest.  He just won't stop playing with it until it's no longer there.  He doesn't really use the card board center to scratch, but this is an excellent toy for the price!",1
"The construction is much more flimsy than I expected, it wobbles to the point that it scares the cat from using it.  I would say this product is only worth in the $50-75 range and is not worth the current $200 price tag.",0
It is very awkward to handle.  My dog is a Havanese and has an under coat and it sticks and won't glide at all.  I end up with a choppy mess and have to resort to other options that I was using before.,0

"The Gumby head is pretty much a little pillow with a strap in it. It was impossible to keep on my dogs head and when it was on it didn't fit because, again, it is like a pillow. Total waste of money.",0
"Great clipper blades, the ceramic stays sharp longer than regular blades and don't cost much more.",1
"I didn't buy this on Amazon, but I had to add to the reviews. I bought some of this to hold me over until I received litter I usually order on Amazon. The heavily perfumed odor is gross before they even use it. I imagine once they use it the overpowering perfume mix will be nauseating. My cats did not like it but thankfully they used it. It also fills the house with dust when you add litter to the boxes. It chokes my family and caused my cat to start wheezing from halfway across the house every time I added even a small amount of litter to the box. So you're breathing dust plus chemicals.",0
This food caused my dog to break out in hives after every meal. I cannot believe they would sell food that makes our dogs sick. Disgusting.,0
If you have a lot of fish in a pons then this is for you.,1
"My dog is not interested in this product at all. In fact, he seems to hate it. I go outside and spray the area of the grass, come back in and take the dog to the area; after the his first sniff of the area he immediately wants to run away from it. I have given it several tries with no luck. However, it could easily just be my dog. We adopted him recently and there are very few things that don't make him nervous, so I'm not surprised he seems to be afraid of/hates this product. I hope it works for some people, but unfortunately it doesn't work for me :(",0
Exactly as described. Exactly what I needed.,1
"DakPets Professional Double Sided Dog Brush.

This works exactly as advertised.  It is great.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1
"Our cats were afraid of the gurgling noise when the bowl is filling from the resivoir, and they refuse to use it.",0
"Great rug to put under the box, does a good job of keeping all the litter contained.",1
My dogs won't eat these!,0
Don't buy this product. I had to return it because it has a huge design flaw. It has a hole near the top of the intake pipe. If your water level gets below this point then the pump fills with air.,0
Shoes would not stay on,0
"When I opened the bones, they were all broken.",0
very good,0
My cat loves this food!,1
My Cat love it & it's super cute to watch them drink from!,1
My dog likes fetching this. It has lasted longer than lots of other toys. Easy for the kids to throw to our dog. Would recommend.,1
they work perfect,1
"The Zack and Zoey Nor'Easter Blanket coat is very nice looking.  However, this coat continued to come off while out on walks. No matter how much I fixed, tightened, etc, the coat would fall off.  We returned it.",0
I need to buy in bulk like this. I don't need anything fancy. This is a great value. I have been using these pads for my small dogs for quite a while now and would recommend them.,1
This product got to me really late and it didn't work at all. I wanted a refund but I never got a reply when I emailed the company. Very dissatisfied.,0
Too small but nothing wrong with it.  Just not what I thought,0
My dog diagnosed with cushings disease. We  gave him the maximum dose of Cushex for 3 months and saw no change in him at all.,0
"Works, but temperature is not steady. One day it will be in the 80's the next 70's with out touching the adjustment. I find this no good for keeping healthy fish.",0
"I don't like this kennel near as much as the ones that I've bought in the past. It is not near as stable and the latches don't move back and forth smoothly. They get caught on the kennel. It's working and usable, but I wish I would have paid more for the brands I've bought in the past.",0
very well made an easy to use ...my maltese's love them.....arrivied quickly and just in time for the freeze we experienced in northern texas..,1
"Arrived on time and is great quality.
Would buy again.",1
Of course my cat loved it!,1
"I read some of the previous reviews and made the mistake of choosing to believe the positive ones. Where to begin...
I have used several different brands of Bully sticks and expect them to smell (afterall, if you expect less you're only fooling yourself...). These, however, have an odor so intense that I have had to seal them in 2 layers of ziplock bags and the surrounding area still smells. When my dog is chewing one of these Bully sticks downstairs, the entire house - including the second story - is filled with their foul odor within less than 15 minutes. I have had to banish him outside to save my family. And, even then, I sprayed Febreeze in his general direction to get the odor out of his fur.

Even if I could live with the smell, I feel misled and duped - these are by no means ""jumbo extra thick"" Bully sticks. I would call them average at best, to less than average for some.

I called Amazon to try to have them call the seller and remedy the situation and all I got for my effort was their agreement to return the product. Call me old fashioned, but wasting my time and energy returning something that is misrepresented, is not an appropriate resolution to the problem.

I am writng this to try to prevent you from wasting your time and energy (and money)...",0
My cat loves this! (Mind you this only works well with short haired cats).,1
"This is a first time review but think it's good to share.  This bark collar never worked.  I tried filling the devise with the citronella spray and it just leaked all over the device.  It never actually got inside. I know I was doing this correctly because I have a similar collar the works with a remote and I can refill it all the time.

On day two the collar beeped.. and beeped... and beeped.  I'm guessing that it was a battery issue although I had installed the provided brand new batteries the day before.  Such a bummer.  I'd love a replacement because I need this product to work but it's been past 30 days so amazon won't take it back.",0
"I love the Scoop Free system. I've been using it for years. When I first started using the Scoop Free system, it included Fresh Step crystals. A few years ago, they switched to generic crystals, without going down in price. The result has been disastrous, as the crystals for my one cat begin to smell like ammonia within a week. In order to rectify this and continue to use the disposable boxes, I separately purchase the Fresh Step crystals and throw out the generic crystals. It's ridiculous to pay this kind of money for an inferior product, while having to switch out and use Fresh Step instead. The parent company really needs to rectify this issue, as I see multiple patrons have the same problem based upon their reviews.",0
Too fragile,0
"I totally agree with other reviewer. If they would lower their price to under $2 a can, I'd buy it. Also, many cans are dented, and I got a couple that were rotten because of the seal being broken from the dents, which were NOT from shipping!!!",0
Its great and lightweight Love it,1
I'm constantly picking up these little squirrel rascals (which means the dogs LOVE it). All sizes of dogs love it.,1
Thank you for your reviews!  I threw this out as I am not willing to put my cats in jeopardy!!!!!,0
"not ultrasonic, i shouldn't be able to hear it when i try to use it",0
excellent product to control fleas in an outdoor cat,1
"We have a 12lb, very small dog.  The description of the product indicated it would hold up to an 18lb dog. My dog hardly squeezes in.  The company offered no free shipping for return exchanges. We therefore kept their product but i would not recommend this to anyone.",0
"Took away four stars because my 5-pound puppy collapsed this pen on herself with little effort in little time. Came home after an hour to find it on its side with only 3 panels holding it open and my puppy sitting in the small area that stayed open. I cannot recommend this product for dogs. Gave one star because product material seemed good, appeared to be escape-proof, and it is a good concept.",0
"I should have read the reviews - this is very misleading. I thought a medium size would mean for a medium dog.  After all, the picture said this would be 5 1/2 inches long and based off the example given, a decent size thickness.  Ii thought it was a joke when I open the envelope - two inches long by a quarter of an inch thick. My dog would swallow this in one gulp.  If this is a medium I would be interested to see what the small is!!  I ended up giving this to my mom's chihuahua - it's the perfect size for her.  Never again will I order from this company.",0
I could not undo it so the cat is left with a collar that is too tight or too loose.,0
"I needed this for an occasional light in my axolotl tank for pictures. I rarely need it at all. When I turn it on, it works great, no problems at all. However, every once in a while, I'll walk into my room to see bright flashing rainbow lights in my tank. This causes a lot of unnecessary stress to my lotl, which is the last thing I want. If it weren't for the spontaneous rainbow lights, this would have 5 stars. Unfortunately, it doesn't.",0
"Very unrealistic,  my box turtles refuses to go into this fake log made from some kind of ceramic.  Wast of money! !!!",0
"Really liked the idea of this product and red lids and scoop that would have gone nicely in my kitchen, and I hoped it would have worked out. It arrived with big cracks in the plastic of the larger container. I know... This is a product review, not a packaging review, so if it were well made otherwise, I'd just have exchanged it and probably given it a good review. However, the plastic itself was thin and brittle and the construction flimsy. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it's a nice looking item if undamaged and might work for some people for storage of very lightweight things (popcorn maybe?), but there's no way it would hold up for dog food storage. Now I know why the price was low. Bummer.",0
Looks great! Absolutely love it,1
I have a 7lb Chiweenie. Says it's a medium and it's more like an XS. Doesn't even fit!!,0
"One of mine walks well and the other doesn't. Always a pain to walk them both.  This makes it a whole lot easier.  The swivel is really strong and even my beasts can't break it.  From swivel to connector is just the right length to keep from tangling. The handle reminds me of a ski rope handle.  Really comfortable to hold on to.  Good product, good price.",1
These work great for my little boy puppy who piddles during the night.  He now gets to sleep in bed with me and he loves that.,1
Our puppy had it torn open after one use and even being in the freezer overnight it still didn't get colder any more than any piece of cloth. Ice cubes worked a million times better.,0
"Product works as it should. ..
But beware. .. they scew you on shipping cost!!",0
Not true to size. Order a much larger size than you think you need. My 10 lb barely fits thru this door rated for up to 45lb animals. Plastic doors work well.,0
"Our dog ""Australian Shepard mix puppy 35lbs"" received this for Christmas and it has already been thrown in the trash. He destroyed this toy in less then two weeks! This is not a good toy for a aggressive chewer, also the squeaker didn't work upon arrival.",0
Worked ppl Kay for odor and cleaning. Did not work as well as I would have liked in keeping the cats from returning to original soiled spot. I sprayed areas dailey.,1
Great brush for good price!,1
"Complements the fish tank well. They were properly rinsed and left to soak for days before adding to the tank. It has gotten a little speckled but I have not tried to take it out and examine or clean. I will update when I do. It moves well with the flow of the current but they also ""move"". Yup, I thought they might be alive :-). Despite their weighted base my goldfish and koi sometimes play with and move them around. I guess since they're the tenants they felt a need to redecorate my tank :-)",1
SO Adorable!  My chocolate lab loves his nautical collar.  Very strong and durable!,1
"Great item, my lab and chowbeagel just love this product and it lasts and lasts.",1
"I bought this for a group of 5 cats (I volunteer at a shelter). Of the 5, one became violently ill, then I researched the product on the internet and found that there were many adverse reactions and even death. Even though it was only 1 out of 5, that's 1 too many. As someone else pointed out, you love your cat. Buy him/her a safe product. It may cost more, but you'll save money in veterinary costs when you have to rush the cat to the ER. Do NOT buy this product!",0
"Snap Leash is a great design. I'm using it for walks, but the main reason I love it is to keep my pup in place while getting some things done around the house. My Leia loves to chase the broom, mop, and vacuum cleaner!

I received the size small and we love it. I wouldn't recommend getting this size for any dog bigger than maybe 25-30 pounds only because of the strength of the grommets. For us, and our Cavalier, it's perfect. She's not a big fan of leashes yet...but this holds her well and does it's job. My only wish would be for it to be longer! She hates it when I have it around my waist because it's too short for her to really go more than a foot or so away from me.

I would definitely recommend this leash! I think the design and the idea is genius. With it's price, it's a steal. I received this item free for an honest review but I will be buying the large one when they release the longer model!",1
"I've been giving my betta this food for about 5 months, ever since I got him. He's always been healthy and happy. I give him 3 in the morning and 2 at night. I also give him a treat of a blood worm once or twice a week.

It took him a little while to get used to the food, probably due to the stress of a new environment and being fed a different brand in the pet store. For the first day or two he wouldn't eat, and I had to suction up the sunk pellets. However, after a couple of days he gobbled these up.

I pour a few pellets into the lid and drop them in his tank one at a time. They float for a few seconds, giving him plenty of time to eat before I drop in the next one.

These pellets seem ""tidier"" than flakes, which seem to dissolve into the water. My friend uses flakes for her betta, and her tank seems to get a red slime on the bottom very quickly. When I use the pellets I know he's eating all of it without it dirtying the water.",1
I am very unhappy with this filter. I had a zoo-med which worked very well but I dropped it on the basement floor when I was cleaning it and broke off one of the hose connections. When I was looking for a new one I saw the fluval and thought it looked like the sherman tank of filters so I bought one and now it looks like I will be changing water every week. I would be happy to have my money back so I can get a zoo-med.,0
item looks like a used one with one light not working and a bad led/6700k switch very hard to press on it i have to return it for refund the shipping fee and seller ship fee cost me 23 dollars don't buy with petstore,0
"I bought this for my cats thinking they would love it since they do love boxes and paper bags.  Nope, not one of them are even the slightest bit interested in it, total waste of money",0
The small round tag is perfect for our 5 month old kitten.  There was ample room to have her name and brief comment on the front and our contact information on the back.  The tag hangs nicely on her collar without being too heavy.,1
Done with buying this collar. I bought one a year ago and the connector piece to the battery broke off. Bought this one and seems to really be junk. Half the time it does not do anything at all.,0
"Works great, and decide what blades you use most and maybe get/have two of them so you can change out when the blade heats up.
All blades heat up after being on for a bit, I used the 10 on the face throat area-(close smooth cut) and a 7 on his body for the summer cut, I alternated them and area I was working on so the blades would cool then go back to the area i was working on with the blade for that area.
 Combs on the Top knot head area!
These cut my Standard Great!",1
"Easy to put up (less than 2 minutes) and great design. Im sure my 4 month bc will appreciate his adult crate. I love the height on it, makes me feel more comfortable for when hes crated for 4 or 5 hours. Gives me peace.",1
My cats love these for their treats. I buy when they are on deals.,1
"These are great dog coats for winter weather. Water repellant and fleece lined, I havnt seen better at twice the price. All my Danes wear them when out in fields in winter",1
Does not work on cats.  Cat can learn to slowly approach where you don't want the cat and defeat the device.,0
"I bought these and gave one each to my 2 jack russell terriers because their teeth and breath have been especially bad lately.  They seemed to love them, but I woke up at 4 am the next day to Max crying--not his regular cry but more of a distressed cry.  I went downstairs and he had had terrible diarrhea in their pen.  For the next two days he continued to have diarrhea and wouldn't touch his food.  His bowel movements are better today but he has terrible gas and is very unhappy and not like himself.  These were the only things my dogs had eaten out of the ordinary and when I looked at reviews here I couldn't believe how many awful experiences there have been and they are still selling them!  I wish I could take back the day I bought them--my poor Mr. Max!  I should note that my other dog has been fine with them, and Max does have a more sensitive stomach than his sister, but no dog treat or food has ever had a negative affect on him like this.  Be safe rather than sorry and do not buy these!",0
Cat is picky but loves this stuff,1
It was awesome !  My daughters dog loves it and so does she because it doesn't make nouse.  My friend had used these for years and PETSMART stopped carrying them.  I was so excited when I found it.  It came in record time!  Thank you,1
Delivered quickly. They were fresh and my dogs love them.,1
"Excellent ground feeder, built very well size is perfect for all size birds. This feeder makes it a great size for hanging on a four ft pole.",1
"Our dog has been on the fish oil for 3 weeks and we notice her coat and skin are healthier, her eyes are clear and her energy levels are awesome! I would absolutely recommend this product and we give it 5 stars!",1
"The gap that we're apparently supposed to close with pressure (which will intent the wall) is several inches. The pieces are welded at too big of an angle, no where near 90 degrees. And the latch doesn't hold.",0
Had bought a bag of oxbow hay at a pet store and my rabbit LOVED it.  It was nice and softish.  Found that on Amazon it is way cheaper and so I ordered a bag.  It is mostly hard stick hay and my rabbit does not like it at all.  Will not be buying again.,0
"My cat had a flea infestation while using this.  My vet said that fleas have developed a tolerance for this product.  He recommended ""Cheristan"" instead which has been working wonders for 1 1/2 years.  I no longer use this product.",0
I cannot tell if these treats are improving the hip and joint health of my dog but she sure jumps around like a kangaroo when she sees them.  This is highly impressive for her age.  They are pricey but I would still purchase them for her because she has clearly communicated her preference for these treats over everything else I have on hand for her.,1
Work great for a very short time for every other day dog walks.  Cord stopped retracting so it is useless after less than 2 months of use.,0
Size is ridiculously inaccurate. Waste of money,0
Great product no mane pulling! My horse loves it!,1
My dog loves these.  And it is so funny to see my grown children's dogs sit & wait for a pill pocket too when they are visiting.  Must be yummy!,1
"My dog is CRAZY for this! Also tried it on a dog that never eats her food, and sure enough, she's eating it now! Will be a lifetime purchaser of this product!",1
It came exactly as expected!  Great product.,1
very disappointed- difficult to put on my little dog due tothe inability to open the clasp.,0
Amazing,1
Title says 2-pack large. only 1 arrived.  Was standing in the pet store and 1 was $9.99 so I thought $10.59 was a great price for a 2 pack.,0
"Strong and sturdy and works well for my doodle puppy (43 lbs, I bought the large). Adjusting to taking on and off the front buckles takes a few tries, but once you have the hang of it, the harness is a great way to keep your pet safe in the car.",1
"Yes I like this product, I have been using for several years. It does slow down the tarter build up, alsoI have noticed another advantage that they do not advertise.
I have a female dog and the baking soda seems to neutrilze her urine and therefore I don't have brown/dead grass spots in my yard.",1
Too difficult to get actual bag apart.,0
Item was much smaller than I expected. My dog is 85lbs and there is no way he would fit.,0
no really. its in the garbage after about a week. was delivered broken (due to poor quality) so i had to make my own repairs. also my dogs must have liked the smell because they started eating it. so i just got rid of it,0
good quality item,1
Very good price. Hours of fun with your fur babies.,1
"Just received mine, had 7 total pcs, a little dusty but just soaked them in a bin and hosed them off, took well to using a chisel and opening up some caves, just need to add some live rock now to get it seeded.",1
Great clippers.... they are excellent for my dogs. The company also goes out of their way to make sure that you are happy with the products and also helps by giving advise for different aspects of you animals well being,1
"It takes, like, four drops of this stuff to treat a 10 gallon tank. This bottle may still be around when my grandchildren are in their graves.",1
This stuff does NOT work! After 2 treatments dog still has fleas!,0
My German Shepherd has been chewing on it for 15 minutes and already broke a piece off so I have to take it away from him because its too light & thin.  Will be throwing this away and spending the extra money on the heavy duty antler I got before,0
"Price went up almost 50% in 1 week, I was buying 1 bag a week, not anymore! They've also been bought out by Purina so goodbye to this product. I will not purchase Nestle Purina products.",0
Great,1
This is my second feeder.  Had the first for about 4 years.  My husband ruined the first by force pushing the next tray into position instead of using the manual turn button.  I love this item so much I had to purchase a replacement.  He has instructions not to touch it.,1
It's so small I threw it away. For toy sizes only,0
The first time my 20 pound dog started scratching on the door shield she put two holes in  the shield.,0
cats love it,1
"This item is listed as 18-3/5"" x 14-2/3"".  It is barely 14"" x 10"".  I realize that the sides are going to slope up a bit, but this is ridiculous--a more than 4"" loss in either direction makes this barely large enough for a kitten.  In fact, it is actually smaller than the ""medium"" litterbox I bought for a kitten.",0
both my cats love these pods.  my sister and nephews got them from santa for their cats,1
work's great  easy to fill also,1
my dogs would not eat this at all.wasted my money.,0
"Purchased this less than a year ago and it was great. Used it maybe a dozen times while hiking with my dog, a 50 pound Shar Pei. Today while walking her I heard a snap and saw the covering outside of the bungee cord ripped at the carabiner leaving the elastic bands exposed. It looks like the metal clip used to tie off the bungee slowly cut through. Although my dog was never at risk of being off leash I think it's no longer safe to use. Now I'm torn between buying another or looking for something else.",0
Meh.,0
The dogs rated this a 5-star. We switch back and forth between this and the smaller chunk style. We break this up for the smaller pets. This is a full meal where the other is a topping or treat. My dogs never seem to tire of this one. You know how they often get bored with a specific food. Not this one. Well worth the spend on a really nutritious item. Great quality and ingredients.,1
If you have dogs that are large and chewers DO NOT BUY. My lab took this ball and turned it into 60 pieces. I don't know if he ate any either but he is still alive so I guess he is good. This was just a waste of money for me. It ended up in pieces and in the trash.,0
Poorly made. Leaked litter everywhere when you turned it over.,0
"It's all about the cats. Neither one of them seemed to like these. One cat wouldn't touch it.
And, not such a big deal, but it is hard to get every morsel out of those pouches.",0
Better than what I used to buy before. Thanks !,1
"The description mentioned it could be mounted to the wall, however it didn't come with any Hardware.  It's very cute, but my 3lb Shih tzu can knock it over.
Kinda a waste of $$",0
"Just the right size, great net. I tape to a pole to clean my Koi pond.",1
This is not worth the money. I had it a week and it is already broken.,0
"Way too dusty. Not even finishing using it, had to buy something different.",0
this product works,1
"We have a dog that prefers the outdoors but likes to roam.  We are afraid she will get hit by a car.  So, we invested it this product that got such good reviews and it worked great for about a month.  Then the collar quit working,we replaced the batteries to no avail.  Then called the company.  They informed us we had to send it back and when they received it we would get another one.  In the meantime the dog roams with the threat of being hit. We finally received the replacement it worked for less than a day.  Called the company and sent back again.  Replacement came 2 weeks later, same thing, worked less than a day.  Called company and sent back again. At this time our patience is wearing thin. 1 week later we get a call saying the collars are on backorder.  No idea of how long.  We asked for our money back and were told the warranty had expired.  We are extremely unhappy. No collar for who knows how long. The dog is roaming free.  HAVAHART is very heartless because they could care less whether our dog is hit by a car or not.  No skin off their nose. WE WILL NEVER ORDER A HARTLESS PRODUCT AGAIN. And advise every consumer out there to invest alittle more into a different company or order at your own risk if you insist or ordering from this hartless company.  I feel like we have given this company a very good chance to rectify a wrong.  I generally do not leave harsh reviews but this one is extremely called for.",0
"Sometimes they work well, and then sometimes you go to pull out the beginning and you have to pull out half of the plastic before you can find it, or the plastic assembly breaks and the entire plastic contents spill out.  Either way poor manufactured design and quality control.  I bought a pack of four and only one operated the way it should.",0
Great Job,1
"The tiny little nubs on the back meant to keep the cover in place are coming off in droves - in the car, in the washing machine. I wrote the manufacturer and threw it away.",0
It was for someone else. And it works great the dog is always warm and comfortable and enjoy being on it two thumbs up its great,1
This was a pretty decent letterbox. I just wish the top cover was more secure,1
Bought 7 months ago and it's already stopped working. We've bought the Littermaid versions in the past and they have lasted us for more than a couple of years each. Will stay away from this brand in the future.,0
"I made mistake not reading ingredients.  Soy Flour, Soy Grits, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Wheat Flour, Corn Syrup, these ingredients are really bad for animal health. Pet and other animal food manufacturing companies should not use these ingredients.",0
"I thought this bag of mice was a great deal, but my two cats go through these within the half hour.  They literally disembowel them and I find paper guts everywhere.  I imagine that they are eating some of this unknown paper, and I don't think that's completely healthy since the stuffing doesn't go under any scrutiny as it is not intended as a food product.  I also didn't know that they were made with real fur, or I wouldn't have bought them at all.  Overall, I think these things were poorly designed so that you go through them quickly, and have to order more.  I will not be buying these again.",0
Both cats refuse to drink the water that this is added to. I had to stop using it completely and rinse out the bowl before they would drink from it again.,0
"Was so excited to get this supposedly ""Large"" elevated dog dish for my American Bulldog.  When I opened it, I literally laughed.  It would be more appropriate for a tall Chihuahua!  The dish itself is VERY small.  It's a nice quality product, but the size is wildly misrepresented.  Just returned it.  Wish they had a REAL size Large. :(",0
"I bought this collar for my 6 pound Yorkie-poo because of his excessive barking.  I was a little concerned at first, because he's so tiny.  However, this collar is perfectly safe and it works very well.  I've had this collar for about two months now and I've only had to use the shock option two or three times (at level one).  He responds very well to the beep option alone.  Not to mention, after only a week of using the collar, his barking decreased quite a bit - even while not wearing the collar.  I am very pleased with this collar and would definitely recommend it to others.",1
Ordered these for Christmas. It is now late January and these have never shipped. WIll not order from ever again.,0
"It is a simple concept but despite the claims, it is not squirrel resistant.  Squirrels have no problem grabbing and nibbling at the suet.  I do not know if meal-worm suet is a deterrent or hot pepper suet.  Perhaps the space of the grates can be made smaller. The latch mechanism is fine and can not be opened by squirrels.",0
my cats love these-keeps them busy till they wear themselves out,1
Pretty good but runs a little big. Wish id got an X-small for my 4 month old maltese mix,1
"I've never seen my cat throw up until a few days ago. He threw up directly after me feeding him a couple of these Greenies. I didn't make the connection at the time, so off and on for a couple days I was feeding him Greenies as a treat and each day I did, he was throwing up. One night I fed him Greenies and the next morning he threw them up, completely undigested. I finally made the connection and stopped feeding him these and the vomiting stopped. I then looked up Greenie reviews online and saw that on ConsumerAffairs.com, the Greenies company has only 1 star and a slew of complaints about how these made their pets sick. Never again!",0
"I realize this is supposed to have the same active ingredients as more expensive brands. However my own personal experience hasn't been great after 2 months of application with this less costly alternative. It just flat out hasn't performed well at all. Weve been battling fleas in our home for the past 2 flea seasons now, but when we applied Advantage products we noticed the cats HAD NO FLEAS for about a month. There may have still been some in the house, but Advantage kept them off our pets entirely, no scratching, none on the flea comb, nothing. PetArmor simply doesnt do this. The very next day & every day after, the cats have a few visible fleas on them & they're scratching. This is very disappointing, especially considering how much less this stuff costs. Who knows, maybe we got a couple bad batches, but so far not so good.",0
"Definitely glad I purchased the large size.  The bed doesn't stay opened for the cats to enter, so it is really just a mat.  Unzipped it is a large mat.  Because of the crinkling sound my cats were afraid of it.  Hopefully the shelter I donated it to will find a use for it.",0

"when fuzzies first come out of the cage, they shoot straight for this thing.  when one is awake and the other sleepy, the sleep one will try to hide in here so that awake guy won't start his weasel war dance.",1
"this small ""X"" pen is great for containing and traing small breed puppies and pregnant females",1

I buy this water pump to replace an old one. It is supposed to be temporary but works so quiet that it stays permanently. It works perfect in my 300 gallon aquaponic system. For the price it's a nice pump.,1
My dogs got fleas and I wanted to something quick so I ordered from Amazon got it the next day. But I gave my dogs the tablets and it did nothing. Now they are flea free because of Comfortis.,0
The dog did not like the product.,0
This product did not help our dog.,0
Too scary.,0
Only litter my cat will use,1
"Well, my dogs don't use it, but that's not the fault of the dog house. It's a nice dog house, and has the thick walls needed to provide the insulating quality I was looking for (from heat or cold). The thick walls are due to a double-wall design. It's light weight, making it easy to assemble, but not so light weight that the 50mph wind gusts here in New Mexico blow it around. It was like putting big Legos together. Very easy, I had no issues. Maybe if I leave it in their yard long enough they'll leave their doggie cot long enough to take a nap in the dog house. But they do love their doggie cot.",1
"they don't rattle much, cat still plays with them..but not as much as other rattling mice in the past",0
This is the only food my Conure will eat. I love when Amazon has it for a lower price than I can get it in the store,1
"2 out of 4 of our cats love this. Our kitten totally turns into an ""animal"" when we bring these out....very worth the money!",1
"I like this so much more than the liquid.  It is more of a gel consistency and doesn't come out of their ears right away.  What I learned, not to clean their ears first, just use the gel.  My dogs ears will get dirty during certain tiimes of the year because of allergies, and this is a God send.",1
"I bought the Orange collar for my Golden for our early morning runs and now I can see her perfectly as she chases the rabbits through the fields.  She likes to roll in stuff and get wet, but I have not had an issue with the collar at all yet. This will come in handy for hunting season too.
It did last about 5 hours on a charge and recharging is easy.
Best of all, customer support is fast and friendly.  I thought I lost my cable and they responded quickly to my inquiry.",1
"Love the design, but sadly after just a few days, we noticed a leak and a large crack had begun across the bottom. Not even sure what caused it!",0
"This was a very cool way to keep our kittens from roaming around the house at night.  It also worked as a way to keep our adult cats away from  the kittens.  Very easy set up and take down.  It worked until they were old enough to climb out the top.  My only suggestion  would be to add more Velcro attachments to the bottom or make it a zipper like the top.  My kittens were able to figure it out quickly that they could escape by going
between the Velcro attachments.  My solution was to just turn it over and use the top as the bottom.  Overall it's a great idea and it saved us a lot of
worry.",1
I bought this on a friend's recommendation and it works pretty well.  Our dog's coat (rotweiller/chow mix) feels and smells great after shampooing and is really shiny.  These conditions seem to last longer too then other shampoos I have tried on our variety of dogs over the years.,1
The other reviews about the horrible smells are correct- it was impossible to get rid of and there's absolutely noway I'd put my puppy in that when i can hardly stand the smell.,0
My dog loves it!  I love it. Just throw the whole thing in the wash to clean,1
One of them showed up broken :(,0
"I have been using this salmon oil for several weeks for my two older dogs, it has helped significantly with their fur, and dry skin. My oldest of the two seems to be moving around a lot better, so I know it must be helping with her joints. This is a very good product, the price is fair. And it is organic.",1
Very poorly made. It lasted one week.,0
Easy to use!  Loved getting the results.  Ordered another one for our other dog.  Customer service was great.  When I sent in the first test there was too much hair from our dogs beard but they sent me another test to try again!  No charge!,1
"If you are looking for real sounding bells, these are if!!!!",1
"Awesome, works great.  Soft rubber material that fits all my different dog food cans.",1
The head bulb was dead on arrival. The combo pack was returned and I didn't take my chances on another one.,0
"Great idea, and my 20-lb dogs loved this toy, but the head ripped off the second day.  I will mend it and let my dogs play with it again when I have time.....",0
My pooch loves this but I have to cover it with a towel or sheet because he licks the cover incessantly - I think it has to do with the texture of the material. Great looking product though!!,1
"I have 3 dogs that I give these to EVERY NIGHT, I use to order the Greenies (7 packs of 3 at a time) from the same company that sells this (Entirelypets) at a super awesome deal, that deal was no longer around after waiting almost 2 months, so I ordered these, the small bones are WAY small compared to the Greenies Petite! I have a review on those as well.

They are not even 3 inches long, and the widest part (top and bottom) are not even an inch wide.

This isn't a good deal for us when they take a couple bites and swallow , this was not a problem with the Petite Greenies.

I'm also super annoyed that less than a minute after placing the order, I sent an email to this company asking them to switch 1 of the boxes for joint care and never got a reply back and I called 2 days later to find out it had shipped and the rude response I got was ""You should have called, we are open 7 days a week"" Great, but you weren't open a 2am when I placed the order!",0
Puppy loves it,1
"I thought about buying the lite, then I realized - don't fix-it if it is not broken. I've heard the lite Greenies are disappointing to dogs. The Greenies have helped immensely with the tartar. We are having her teeth cleaned but I feel with the Greenies and brushing her teeth regularly, we will never have to subject her to another teeth cleaning with the vet.",0
"I never realized my cat was picky until I bought her different food and she lost a bit of weight!  She definitely prefers BG Salmon over any other food, which I consider a win!  It's always important to me that the first two ingredients listed on my pet's food are sources of protein.  In this case, the first two ingredients are ""Salmon Deboned, Chicken Meal.""  The rest of the ingredient list is pretty solid, so I'm happy with the quality of the food.  Additionally, my cat NEVER throws up (literally has twice in the 5 years she's been alive--and it wasn't food or hairball related when she did), and I attribute a lot of that to the fact that I feed her high quality food.  Overall, very happy with BG Salmon!",1
Absolutely love the look of it but it it is already ripped next to the zipper enclosure and the top zipper catches on the material. I need to be able to do things one handed as I'm a breeder and this is for whelping puppies. Wish I would have gone with something heavier Duty. It's great for day-to-day use for pets if you don't plan on zipping and unzipping at a,0
Ran extremely small. I ordered two in medium for my Toy poodles. When I opened up the package I was sad. They were both more for very small toy or a puppy not a full grown toy. I had to cut it in order to fit halfway on my dog.,0
"We used Nature's Variety (non Instinct formula) for a while, but when we moved to our current location, the closest we could find was Natural Balance, so we had to switch.  When NB put out their grain free Alpha Dog, I tried that out and was amazed at how my normally very smelly Boston Terrier suddenly didn't seem to have any gas at all.  This got me searching for reviews, where I discovered the NV's Instinct line was rated much higher than NB's Alpha dog.  When I discovered the Amazon subscriptions, and how inexpensive that makes it(relative to what I pay at the pet store for organic pet food), I decided to give NV another try.  For the first week, I mixed the last of the old food with the new to get him used to it.  He had diarrhea and the worst gas EVER for days.  Now it's been a week on just the NV food and the sickness has not stopped.  I though maybe he was suffering from seasonal allergies and that's why he seemed so blahhh lately.  Last night I put it all together and realized it's the food.  I really wish I could get a refund, but at least I stopped the subscription in time not to get another.",0
"Ha. Ha. Ha. Definitely does not work, plus the device gets super hot so I had this fear that not only would my dog not chill out, but my apartment would be on fire.",0
Great stuff!,1
good product,1
AVOID unless you hate your money and never want to see it again,0
"I had hoped that the squeaker would have lasted longer for my ""Spike"" to enjoy.  We had one before that lasted for a year, this one lasted about 2 days.  We had taught him to bring the ball to us when we said, ""Go get your football.""  He would and make it squeak until we took it from him.",0
I love Kong toys you can use as feeders. I brought this with my pups to a get together with my cousin and his three dogs (can you say puppy overload; the sure outnumbered us). His dogs never play other toys or found them interesting. These grabbed their attention and with 48 hours my cousin was buying them for his dogs too!!! I like the medium for small kibble and pellet treats and the large for mini bones.,1
perfect!,1
"I bought this to plant for a fall food plot where I hunt and I had several issues with the product. First of all it was crawling with some kind of bugs that I think ate up most of the seed. The seeds were covered in what I can best describe as ""chalk dust"".  I did my soil test, plowed and planted and very little if any of it came up even after a couple of good rains. After a couple of weeks I saw that nothing was coming up so I went back in and reseeded the plot with a combination of Throw N' Grow and Antler King's Honey Hole and now those seeds are coming up.",0
I began using this product because my dog is allergic to meat. I wanted him to have a chew treat. He has been eating these for 11 years. He is now 13. He has not had to have his teeth professionally cleaned. I attribute this to greenies and his hard dog food.,1
The big dog loves this. Super soft. I put it in his SoftKrate (NOZTONOZ Sof-Krate Indoor/Outdoor Pet Home) with a folded-to-fit moving blanket between this mattress and the Krate floor.,1
"My crested gecko loves this! I'm glad I found this too, because he wouldn't eat much of anything before. He eats this right up.
10/10 would recommend for picky eaters.",1
"Our dog was more interested in the rope than the ball, and it is too long for a rope toy.",0
"Had it for about 4 hours and now I can't find it.  My dog has a sore paw due to snow and weather but it not that bad that he can't get around.  This is a great idea and it is made well.  The fabric is nice, sturdy and the velcro will attach anywhere.  The fit is bad.  There is no bend in the fabric for the dog's ankle (I don't think it is actually called an ankle).  The 4 hours we had it I adjusted or put it back on numerous times.  Sometimes it just fell off while he was walking.  I tried to secure it tightly but there seemed to be too much fabric at the ankle I could never get it snug enough.  He had had enough of it and went off for a few minutes and came back without it.",0
This fountain is an important purchase for a cat that likes running water . Very easy to maintain. I highly recommend this great water fountain for animals.,1
"Great quality, washes well and dries quickly. Love that it is reversible. Attractive colors and suitably padded. I bought 2, one for the crate and came back for one for the car. Would love if they came in an even smaller size for a soft carrier for airline travel.",1
Returned smaller and shells not what we expected,0
It's a great deal.  A better deal would be the 3 pack.,1
"Look great, have used one in the past while hiking. It was perfact, bought these as a gift.",1
"I was excited that these were grain free healthy chewies for my papillon mix but he got sick to his stomach and threw up each time he ate one. I'm not sure what ingredient is not sitting well in his stomach, in the 10 years I've had him, he rarely ever throws up, so I was quite surprised when this treat gave him that reaction.",0
"Not what I thought at all. The top ""bowl"" part does not hold the water unless you continue to squeeze the bottle. Complete waste of money.",0
nice and sturdy,1
Not a fan it didn't work I thought it made it smell worse,0
The tank showed up broken in several places!  I have a very sad 9 year old.,0
Smells almost as bad as what it's trying to remove.,0
Works well and my dog loves it!,1
Our hamster gets out of this every time we put her in it.,0
Got here pretty fast but the tag should say Live Feeder 500ish baby small crickets.,0
This is twice the size and half the price of our pets stores in the area.,1
Very pretty but they arrived broken.. the bottom rock part was broken on both of them. Chipped on a few sides causing pieces of the plant to fall off..,0
"Would not turn on unless hooked to a car battery, does not draw fluid, noisy.",0
my dog is not interested and doesn't consider it a play toy. I consider it a source of leaving kibble everywhere.,0
"I stored these in a bail and trigger jar to keep airtight and within a month they were so dry I was afraid they might break my dog's teeth.
Had to throw them out :-(.",0
Very cheaply made and was broken upon arrival,0
For something that advertises how quiet it is as one of its selling points this was the LOUDEST pump I've ever heard.  So loud I couldn't sleep in the other room and had to go unplug it.  Maybe mine was defective in some but I can't recommend this product for anything.,0
Cheaply made and rattled so much I threw it out.,0
I am a veterinarian and have used these beds daily in our practice for almost 3 years.  The covers are durable (easy to wipe clean - originals still look new) and there is no evidence of deterioration of the foam padding.  They are as good as the day I bought them.  OCK9 beds are the only ones I recommend and will purchase for both practice use and for my own pets.,1
My cat loves these burlap mice and they are sturdy therefore he hasn't totally destroyed them yet!,1
"Great value for the price. It does seem like it could come apart easily however it has not, yet. I think I will take the advice from another reviewer and zip tie it just to be safe.",1
"Theseawhide last for hours, even with a Giant Schnauzer gnawing on them. Love that I can get them on auto delivery, and so do my 4 dogs",1
Bought this for my gf's small dog. It's light and easy to carry. Although it can be folded up we prefer to keep it open. Highly recommended,1
"Great size. I have two dogs that drink a lot of water and I love this product. I went from refilling a water bowl almost two or three times a day from a little more than a week :)
It also has a filter system on the cap which is nice too.",1
Wood product. ... but delivery time super bad...,1
"Love this. Works great, battery life is amazing. Does what I need it to do!",1
"The first time it came the front door was cracked, which I didn't notice until after I had already assembled it and was putting the bunny in.  So, I asked for a replacement, the 2nd one came the exact same way; broken!  Same piece was cracked.

Also, small is an understatement.  This would be ideal for a guinea pig, but is way too small for a dwarf rabbit!  My bunny gets mad when I put him in it.  We use this as his indoor winter home.",0
"Only get ONE, not three",0
Doesnt work for small dogs,0
Worthless. Has no effect on my animals.,0
No difference in behavior. No calming effect.,0
For test results are good,1
"What can I say?  My turtles love this ""penthouse"".  I have tried everything from basking logs to rocks but this thing works the best.  I just wish they made one that would fit a 125 gallon tank.  I added reptile carpet to the ramp so they don't slide down so fast and have an easier time going up into the penthouse.",1
"Perfect length for my 150 gallon tall aquarium. Tank is 34"". Long enough to reach things on the bottom without getting my elbows wet. Includes two attachments . . . a cutter attachment and a handy grabbing attachment.",1
This is absolute junk.  Its not treated for outside and if you look at the photos on amazon its clesrly treated then you receive one that is not.  The wood is garbage and splinters easily.  Hello splinters while assembling your garbage product.  It was covered in some sort of pet hair straight out of the box as well. Further more assembling is not easy or functional as part of the top piece protruded out and makes it extremely difficult to screw the pieces together.  The stairs are useless.  One of the pieces was actually manufactured backwards as well which has rendered this peace of junk useless.  This entire thing is useless.  I want a refund.,0
This product left open sores on both of my cats. DO NOT BUY,0
6 months now and my pit mix still hasn't destroyed it.,1
My cats used to be crazy about these and now they are turning their noses up. ,0
What can I say but our Yorkie loves this product. This is like the third or frouth time we have bought this chicken. Easy to serve and keep also.,1
my small dogs pap and poms love to chew on these,1
"Pros:  easy setup

Cons:  in our neighborhood we have small and medium sized dogs and this device has done nothing to stop or even slow the non stop barking.  Also burns through batteries very quickly at a rate of roughly every 2 weeks.",0
"This bowl is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  I have an 18yr old dog named Mr. Pink that has decided he doesn't want to finish all his food right away.  This is the perfect solution that keeps my other kibble hungry mongrels away from his meal until he decides he wants more and hopefully keeps it a little fresher in the process since the lid had a little gasket to help it seal and stay in place.  Another benefit of the bowl is that it is harder for him to accidentally tip over.  Oh, and it's pink!  Woo!  All in all I highly recommend.",1
"Whimsical?: oddly cute.
Sizing?: max feet size should be EU 38.  I thought feet for EU 40 would be small enough but clearly not.
Would you recommend?: how big are your feet?",0
"If you need help putting it away, there's a great youtube video. The instructions were no help. After watching the video, it was a breeze. I purchased the medium size for my 2 chihuhuas. There's plenty of room for their pillows, potty pad, food and room to play. My 10lb chihuahua jumped over it when they were alone during a thunderstorm. Otherwise he stays put. If you're worried about them jumping out, put the cover.  I recommend when you first get it, go inside it and play with them. Give them treats and leave the door open. My dogs love it, my husband calls it their headquarters. They go in and out of it while were home, and I put them in there when I go to work. As always, once I put them in they're expecting a treat!",1
The smell is overwhelming. Try anything else before this.,0
"Doesn't work at all, the first couple of times my dog barked he would turn around and look where the bird house was but after about 15 minutes, he started to bark like usual.",0
"My mini dachshunds have been loving these harnesses. They fit well around the legs and chest, are easy to put on and take off quickly and my two puppies have not been able to slide out of them like other harnesses. That's a win in my book. After more than a month of use, the color has held up nicely and they seem to be well made. They do run a little small, so my miniature dachshunds wear size medium - order accordingly.",1
Quality is not same as my last order. It is not solid anymore but some liquid stuff. My cat did not eat at all.,0
"In vet school, want to do feline medicine, so hopefully that gives you an idea of the source of my opinion. Long time slave to feline overlords.

These are by far some of the most loved toys I have ever encountered. I actually am gifting them for the holidays. I bought extras to store in case they don't make them anymore someday. They're incredibly durable and an extremely good return on money invested at this price. If you play with your cats (as you should) I can guarantee these will delight all of you, their faces and excitement are magnificent. My chunky little one wouldn't even put the first one down to eat Temptations--probably the highest compliment she has ever paid to a toy.

Can't recommend highly enough as attachment upgrades.

Great gift for the cat lover in your life--they will be crazy impressed that you picked out something so enticing.",1
Love love love these jelly fish under blue light look amazing!,1
"For that much money in the very least you would hope to get a new cage that was well packaged.... but even that did not happen in our case - we received broken boxes, with parts that were obviously used, twisted and damaged. We tried to put it together but after spending two hours, realized that some parts were missing...",0
Difficult and messy refilling the water,0
JUST GREAT . JUST LIKE THE OLD ONE THAT WE HAVE USED FOR OVER 30 YRS AND JUST FELL APART,1
Fine print on can says not for human consumption.,0
"An oxymoron? Not if you find a compatible pump with enough lift capability. I haven't.  The only pump I've gotten to work is the Tom Dosing, which is not designed for a high head.

I suspect this ATO designers saved a few cents with electronic switching, changing the AC waveform or something. Not interested in debugging it or tampering with the design. Fortunately, I'm an engineer and have the ATO driving a relay which can run any pump.  Don't do this unless you know what your doing as AC voltage and water is deadly.",0
"Poo bags should be part and parcel with the addition of any companion.  Pooing on neighbors lawns is often illegal in many states and poses a health hazard.  Not to mention the possibility of stepping in the poo or your children ""finding"" poos in their play yard. In the winter we poo-bag it, on walks we poo-bag it, in the summer we have a doggie septic system.  Be responsible: PICK UP YOUR POO!

These bags are colorful, of sufficient and fit well into our poo-carriers attached to leashes.",1
dogs love all toys.,1
"I wish I could of picked the color, but I knew this is the toy my 2 cats would love. I had to leave their old toy across the country and gosh did they attack me when I pulled this out of the box! Now they fight over who gets to sit on it longer. i didn't know this toy multi-function as a cat bed!",1
Bought it for feeding medicine to dog. The dog figured out how to turn to the next food section within a day. It is a great idea and could work great if some modifications were made.,0
Worked great at curing my dogs rash on his belly,1
"These should not even be for sale, they have been re- called and are dangerous to pets. My dog got very ill from these. These are made in China and may have a Very dangerous Toxin in them. Several brands have been re-called.",0
"The toy Broke the first time my quaker played with it, the thing is all plastic and
Even at only 3.99 it should of lasted a little longer",0
Inconsistent thickness,1
"The pool is smaller than I expected, also it is more of a gray color. The crabs seem to like it, though.",1
"This seems to do the trick.  My cat is over 20 years old and no longer grooms her beautiful fluffy belly fur properly.  If she would sit still better, this comb would have her looking gorgeous again in about 15 minutes.  Instead I use it in 30 second spurts.  I think the thing I like best is the size of the comb part.  It's about 1.5 inches long and .75 inch wide, perfect for getting her belly when she doesn't want me to.",1
boots fit..... followed all the sizing instructions and dispite that they slide off and my poor dog was sliding all over and was very unsteady due to the fact there is no grip to the bottom of them,0
"Neither my cat, nor myself, have ever had issues with allergies. I switched to this litter and that changed overnight. My cat and myself kept sneezing for a week until I realized how dusty the litter was and how it was affecting the both of us. Looked it up and apparently it's called silica dust and many cats and humans are allergic to it. Just a heads up for anyone who may be sensitive to dust of any kind, especially silica dust.",0
"Easy to install.  Bulbs weren't working before.  Replaced the ballast (I believe it was the starter that went faulty but, you can't buy them separately for these units)and now the PCs are working great.  Not much else to say.",1
My stray cat loves this toy.  And I am shaking it from a good distance because of the long handle so I don't have to worry about being clawed.,1
Love it!! It is all it says it is and sturdy ,1
"Loved it! My dogs ripped it to shreds one day while we were outside on a cold day, but it was my fault for not keeping a close eye on them... It did take FOREVER for shipping though.",1
"LOUD. I should have read more of the reviews- this toy is VERY loud, making a clacking/grinding noise as it spins. At first my cats were scared of it. Now they do come running when they hear it, but they really only crouch and watch it rather than trying to chase the light. It keeps them occupied for only a few minutes at a time before they lose interest and wander off.",0
Works as expected for my RO unit for my fish tanks.,1
The dog wouldn't go near it! Bad gift purchase for the daughter.,0
Not very KONG-like. Had two months and this one split. Plastic inside is dangerous. I never let dogs play with them alone. Always an interactive toy with me.,0
This is the most awesome cat litter box ever......I got so excited the first time that I cleaned the litter box and saw how well it worked.,1
"Cheap material, red vinyl flakes off after a few weeks",0
Exactly what my older cat needs to get by. I might start taking Cosequin for my arthritis and joint problems,1
"My dog is very picky and he loves them, hope you continue to carry them.",1
"Switched from Blue Buffalo because Blue was giving my Boxer & Lab loose runny poops.  This one is just right.  The dogs love it and get annoyed when their bowl is empty.  The Blue Buffalo was in a self feeder and they grazed, this food I can't leave the self feeder down, I need to serve them or they would stuff themselves!  GREAT price, too.  $20.00 less than the large pet product stores in my town.",1
The smell doesn't work for me and rubbing all over the dogs doesn't work either.,0
Very heavy duty. Never seen a leach this well constructed. Almost over built and the lights are a plus for safety at night.,1
My dog absolutely loves these! And for the price you can't go wrong. He gets so excited for a whimzee!,1
"I didn't get this off Amazon, I purchased it from my vets office. Day 2 of scrubbing my dog with this stuff and he almost smells worse today! I don't find it to be very affective!",0
It really looks good in my fish tank.,1
"All three of mine came 90% dead with scarcely a trace of green on them. Advertised as long, somewhat log-shaped, and roughly palm or hand sized, but mine were barely over one square inch each.",0
It performed well in the beginning but now it 1) doesn't hold charge for more than 10 minutes 2) is slow even when fully charged/plugged 3) runs very hot after 5 minutes,0
"This feeder was opened by a miniature Dachshund over the weekend. He opened one of the clips which then gave him the ability to open the entire top. He the then ate everything in one sitting leaving him happy but starving for the remainder of the time I was absent. Also there was a giant human sized poop waiting for me when I arrived, understandable since he ate 4 meals at once!",0
"We have a Boston and have tried several harnesses for him with no luck. I finally scoured Instagram pages (stalked) other Boston owners and saw that a bunch of them used this brand. So, our family tried it and voila! Terrific fit, terrific look!!",1
Great price for environmentally responsible quality item,1
"BUYER BE WARE!
Not a Kyjen product. The product came with a different label and the squeeker DOES NOT sound like the KYJEN brand.
Many of the squeakers broke within an hour!!!!",0
Stinky!! They smell like an oil refinery. Ran them through the dishwasher and now I can't get the smell out of the dishwasher.  May have to replace the appliance!!!,0
Great,1
I would buy again!,1
"I like the portion control aspect of the feeder, but not very durable. A plastic part in the inside broke off and now the feeder doesnt work, which is not what I would expect from a feeder over $100.",0
"Love it - sturdy, well thought out (although instructions for the drain assembly would be a nice addition) - there is a review with details about that already with pictures. The only thing the pictures of the drain assembly don't show is a small metal hex-nut (that I managed to loose since I wasn't looking for it) - suggest laying it out on a counter or table until you're sure you have all the right parts.

I've been grooming for 8+ years and got this for my home shop - I've bathed a mini-Chihuahua up to a regular size (guessing 50 lbs) Aussie in it, and it has held up perfectly.

It would be wonderful if Flying Pig could include 3 adjustable grooming loops, make the shampoo bottle's holders a bit bigger (skip the bar soap holder), also an extra hex-nut or two with detailed drain and hose instructions would make it perfect.",1
"This little sweet outfit is just too dang cute, and looks GREAT on my little 4.5 lbs Yorkie!",1
"It does have a nice citronella scent, unfortunately my 150 pound 11 month old puppy seems to like the scent so it does not stop him from scratching the doors.  I have now invested in door push plates and kick plates to install vertically below the door knobs on the doors where he scratches.  Long term, better off training him to ring a bell instead of scratching.",0
Beautiful and easy to assemble,1
"Vendor is located in china and it took 3 weeks to arrive.description says small,medium,large sizes but I received all large. Look else where for these as they are cool but not from china,buy American!",0
I'm pretty sure this attracted fleas to my two cats.,0
did not bring hardware,0
Smells good,1
"My dogs love it! I have 2 senior dogs and with every day dose they still move like young puppies.
My dogs are 12 years old and 13 years old. Thanks to extra vitamins they are still running around and no problems with Hips or joints.",1
"This thing really, really, really works. Our vet recommended it. I cannot believe how much loose hair it combs out of our cats. I feel like I could start a small business selling Tribbles, as that's what it looks like when I'm done combing these guys. We've had massive hairball issues with one of them and I'm hoping this will help considerably. They also feel silky smooth and they look so beautiful when we're done combing them with the Furminator. I've not ever seen them look so silky, and we've always brushed them regularly with a regular cat brush. That said, every one of our three cats hates this thing. Brushing them with a regular brush is fine and dandy (except for one cat who has never been really fond of it), but they see this thing coming and they take for cover. They hate it. One cat will even attack it until we pet him for a bit and calm him into it, and he still isn't really happy about it at all, no matter how gentle a stroke I use. It works fabulously well. It really, really does, but the cats hate it. I'm hoping over time they'll get used to it. A friend of ours uses it on his cat and has no problems at all and his cat enjoys it, but our boys, they are all sassy pants about it. Our vet says it's the best deshedding comb out there. After using it just a few times, I believe it.",1
Just did not work for my dogs.,0
"It's really a great product, cuts fast and in a rounded manner. My cats got used to it and now I clip their claws really fast.",1
Great product and easy to use.,1
thank you,1
The pup loves these!,1
My dog loves these!,1
This was easy to set up and has been great for travel. I leave it at my parents' house so I have a crate there and don't have to lug a wire kennel back and forth. Fits my 45 lb australian shepherd great with plenty of room to spare. She can stand up and sit in the crate without brushing her head along the roof of it even with a bed inside.,1
The item stop working in the firt week?,0
"I've ordered Best Bully Sticks many, many times, and they are a consistently excellent product. They are, paws down, my dog's favorite treat.",1
Very dissapointed in this dog rake. It was working just fine until after about 2 dozen uses and then the handle came off. Now it is useless unless I want to speend more money buying some type of glue to glue it back on. Will not buy Furminator products again.,0
These also arrived broken into small pieces.,0
My cat absolutely loves this food and it is extremely good for her. Her coat is beautiful and shiny.  I also feed her the Wellness dry food as a snack and she cannot get enough.,1
This product has an odor that i am not interested in. I definitely don't like it. It definitely must be vacuumed up right away because its such a fine powder it shows on the carpet very easily. Returned it no problem,0
Really happy with the mat but the collar is too small for my 44 lb. Aussie.  The mat has been great to have for the summer shows.,1
I have had my dog on denosly for months. Now I am finding all kinds of red pills that didn't dissolve in his waste. What's up with that?,0
these leashes are junk.  after 2 months they don't retract properly and the material on the handles are coming off.  I have used retractable leashes for 7 years and never had ones this defective,0
"My dog isn't much of a chewer, but this only lasted about 5 minutes.  I looked up and she'd torn out the squeaker and a bunch of stuffing in no time at all.",0
"My dog used to scratch all the time and we figured it was allergies, so we were constantly taking things away from her to try and figure out what it was that was making her itch.  We had stainless steel bowls for her and one day I thought well I have an allergy to certain metals lets try new bowls, so we purchased these bowls and she didn't stop itching but it has calmed down a considerable amount.  Very Happy",1
Cats love them.,1
"Its everything they say it is except extra durable. Our 2 year old, 10 lb poodle shih tzu rescue mix had it opened up in 15 mins and defluffed in less than an hour.  We didn't expect it to last forever but Hugglehounds brand sells itself as super durable and this was our first try with it. We had read other reviews similar to this but they seemed to be bigger dogs so decided it was worth a try.  I don't recommend buying this if durability is your key concern.  That being said, it remains a great tug toy for him and it is great that the eyes and nose are embroidered and not hard plastic.  He would have had those off first thing had they been plastic or some other hard material.",0
Do Not Waste Your Money! Worked for 30 mins and the motor just stopped. Sending back,0
"Great product, fresh. My bunnies love it.",1
"So far really pleased with the bed. And our golden retriever puppy seems to love it, so we're happy customers!",1
Best food ever,1
"The picture makes the exterior 'look' like it is suede-esk, but it's actually a cheap thin mixture between fabric and plastic.  The heat barely radiates through and only when the cat is inside (although the bottom of unit is always toasty).

The cord is the best feature.  Very sturdy and assuring.

Would not suggest this product.  Over priced.",0
"These pet waste stations were easy to install and don't stick out in the landscaping.  The green color blends well and no one has complained about seeing them.  We haven't noticed any smells coming from the trash can, so it does a good job of keeping everything contained.",1
I don't recommend. Not very absorbent. Leak around edges.,0
"These actually taste really good!  LOL, that's at least what my dogs tell me",1
I thought it came with eggs.  You have to add crickets.  Just seemed to be a waste of money.  I put crickets in it and did as it suggested.  Nothing happened.,0
Sizes are apparently for toy dogs only. Or cats. Bought a medium for my usually medium sized dog and it fit her head.,0
"Always use.  Great product,",1
"I purchased this heater for a new 20 gallon long aquarium set up.  Upon installing it I really was confused as to why it had a ""minimum water level"" line on it which reminds me of the thermostatic heaters that always broke and killed fish with them because of people letting their tanks run low.  Despite my concerns I was (perhaps falsely) reassuring myself that it was fully submersible because, well, it says it is.  The heater seems to work fine for a month or so and I noticed eventually that it seemed not to be turning on so I checked it out by turning the thermostat up.... nothing.... I even gave it some time and tried touching it to see if it felt warm -- nope.  I unplugged it for a while and tried again and confirmed that the unit was dead.  The thermostat knob it's self wasn't really staying in position either which didn't shock me because the entire top half of the heater seems to be built cheap.  It's possible that this was a fluke but I really just don't have a good feeling about this heater at all.  I know it's tempting with the number of good reviews and the cheap price but my suggestion would be to avoid it.",0
Just put it dog let her out to bathroom and she came back and it wasn't lit. The part u click to turn it on fell out somewhere,0
"This is a terrible feeder. It looks fine when you open the package, flimsy plastic, but my dog is not a crazy eater. Very light weight plastic. The instructions to put on the legs are ""Press firmly in the corner"" and a picture of instructions and a big ""SNAP"" on the picture. Well, that didn't work and I tried my arms, hands, rubber mallet, didn't snap. So the other paper that came with the dog bowls said if you need help visit the product website and click on help. I went to the website and there was no category in help for how to assemble. I went on YouTube and found nothing about anyone assembling this bowl. I have spent way too much time on this bowl and it has already shipped back. DO NOT BUY THIS.",0
"I hope word has gotten out by now.  DO NOT FEED N-BONE FERRET CHEW TREATS to your furries long-term, no matter how much they love them!!!  Only one out of my 4 ferrets ate them, only for 2 years until I read the health warnings and stopped, but the damage was done.  I buried my almost-4-year old Max yesterday.  He wasn't sick long - - until about 2 weeks ago he was as active and loving as could be.  But then had a huge, rapid weight loss, so I took him to the vet for tests and diagnosis, and he was gone within 2 days. The ultrasound and lab reports showed his liver was a mess. I blame N-Bones entirely because that's the ONLY thing Max consumed different from my other 3 healthy kids.  Don't touch this stuff.",0
It does seem to calm our cat but it doesn't last for a whole month. I can always tell when it begins to wear off (usually around 3 weeks) because she goes back to being aggressive toward our other 2 cats.,1
REFUSED MY SIMPLE RETURN REQUEST FOR LARGER SIZE AND ARE VERY RUDE ABOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS !!!  Defiantly  WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN OR TELL ANYONE ELSE NOT WORTH IT WHAT SO EVER . PRETTY MUCH STOLE MY MONEY . ORDER ELSE WHERE AT ANY COST,0
This dog collar works well. It's very bright and clear. The fit is a little puffy and the lighted portion is not 360 to allow space for the switch but it's still bright from any angle. Does not seem to shine in dogs eyes or bother him in the least. I still use only for street walks at night and still only hook his leash to his body harness. My dog has gotten lots of complements on his new lighted collar.,0
"ordered a tag, actually to attach to the rosewood box after the passing of my beloved pet. ordering was easy, product arrived quickly, and could not have been more pleased with the final product. have since ordered another for my nieces dog to go on a new collar and leash gift. second time as good as the first. great quality, great price.",1
way toooo small,0
I'm disappointed the first ingredient is Sorbitol. The item came quick and the package looks to be in good condition. But I'm posting a picture of ingredients for people who care what ingredients may be in the product. I have not and probably will not use the product on my puppy. So I cannot speak to it's effectiveness or if my puppy liked it's taste etc.,0
"This is probably not an accurate interpretation of the FortiFlora product itself. We have an 11 year old cat that has a long history of soft stools & diarrhea. He loved taking the product, I just sprinkled it on a few kibbles with a bit of water so I was really hoping this might help him. After several weeks and no improvement I'm not sure it was actually helping him. We are proceeding with further more intensive testing & treatment.",0
"Wonderful cat food! My Ragdoll, which is a senior and has food allergies with other high grade foods..this can food works with her digestive tract and causes zero issues. She's healthy and shiny and acts like a kitten! I only feed my Furkids top brands and this food does not disappoint.",1
"What a huge disappointment!  I really wanted this to work, but it doesnt.  I did get unit to connect and video sent to iOS phone once.  Spent half a day trying every tip/answer/suggestion on their site & in reviews.  Dont waste your time with this product its too fussy and guaranteed to be a big disappointment.  Still haven't heard from customer support, really they need a phone number or to be more responsive to current email system.  I should not have to contact customer support to set up a device that only has 3 steps.  Need to find something better that can meet needs, will have to wait for that!",0
Very pretty but apparently not good for cats who tend to be allergic to plastic.  I kept the stainless steel insert and gave the outer bowl to a friend for her dog.,1
"I was very disappointed with this product. It wasn't out of the packaging for 5 minutes before my border collie, who is not very tough on toys, had punctured and tore the fabric spilling small plastic discs all over the floor. The plastic discs were the the size of a lentil and the dog could have easily ingested them. I realize this is not meant to be a toy, but judging how easily the fabric was punctured and torn I don't think it would hold up to being used for retrieving either, which I never got to do because it didn't last long enough.",0
"Product works great! No discolor on my tan couch or blue carpeting, cats have not marked again since applying this product.  The product odor is strong but not unpleasant.",1
I have used Denamarin for years on my dogs and it has really helped when their liver enzymes are too high.,1
My cat refuses to eat it.,0
"Dog is on steroids for allergies.  has begun wolfing down food and hungry for more.  This med bowl is nice fit, she is about 50 pounds.  It does take her longer to eat.  Bowl is weighted and heavy enough to not get pushed around by her urgency.",1
"These balls are well made and durable. However, there is a strange menthol coating on the balls. There is a very potent smell of menthol on them, I washed them in very hot water for 5 minutes and it actually made the smell worse. My dog actually licked it and made a face, and hasn't played with it since. I would think it would not be very hard to make a product without spraying it with a smelly menthol coating.",0
I recently purchased two of these pens and like them fine. They are very useful for my small dogs and are pretty sturdy. The pens arrived in useable condition but slightly bent because of either poor packaging or poor handling on the part of the shipper. They arrived half out of the carton they had been packed in.,1
Ball was broken. Sometimes it lights up sometimes it doesn't. Had to tape ball together.,0
great product! Our dog loves it!,1
"I use this scoop for two very large litter boxes made from Rubbermaid containers, each filled with 40lbs of Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Clumping Clay Litter.  The clean litter falls through quickly, and the baseball-sized urine clumps are rock solid and do not roll off the flat-ish surface of this scoop.  The sifted litter stays very, very clean.

Because this litter stays so clean with regular scooping using the Litter Lifter, I don't need to ever totally change out the remaining loose litter.  I just top it off when it gets low (I try to keep it 3-4 inches deep). I have two female cats, and I scoop these two very large boxes 1-2 times a day.

The scoop I received is a nice purple (my favorite color - bonus!). It seems to be a very durable thick plastic, but I could definitely see it being affected by the wear and tear of sifting through that heavy clay litter over time.  If it does ever break, I will definitely get another one.

Switching to the Dr. Elsey brand litter, using this scoop, making my own super large litter boxes from tote boxes, and using a Litter Genie have all made my daily litter scooping routine so easy and effortless, with the cleanest possible litter boxes I could get, in my opinion.  My girls are happy squatters.

I can see how this would be difficult if not impossible to use for those with arthritis... the scoop cuts through and sifts a large amount of litter at a time, and gets very heavy.",1
They really work to control vomiting from hairballs.  I can see the difference when I don't use them vs using them.  Cats like the taste as well.,1
I didn't even get a chance to take it out of the package before my puppy found it. She chewed off bits of rubber within minutes and would of torn the thing to shreds. Save your money & don't buy.,0
Very good product,1
"The replacement wand and feather fit the panic mouse perfect and now my little kitten is busy chasing it around and around.
Also saved money for me.  Because she loves this toy so much, I was prepared to buy a new panic mouse.",1
Our cats LOVE this bed!!!  I like that I can remove the cover and machine wash it. I also like that it works with the body heat of the animals so it doesn't get too warm. We purchased the large size and 3 adult cats fit with room to spare.,1
My husband and I agree that this is not a very stable piece.  Our kitten will have nothing to do with it.,0
"The product description is incorrect. The documented length is 33cm/13inches, however the actual length of the item I received was 9.5inches/24cm. I searched specifically for a longer reach pair of scissors of at least 12"", because my aquarium is very deep. I was very disappointed with the misleading product description. Please correct the product description, so that other customers aren't mislead.",0
"Unappetizing, highly refined. Give us real foods, not stuff of questionable origins!",0
It doesn't work. Had no discernible effect on any dog.,0
dogs like it,1
"I have been buying this rope for my puppies for about two years now. I own a staffie and a lab, together they can go through it in 3 months. This saves me a lot of money on dog toys. The only bad thing about this toy is the trail of strings around the house when they finally get it into pieces. It is also flossing their teeth when they are playing with it.",1
"I don't understand why this litter is called ""clumping litter"" - it does not clump.
Liquids are not clumped and the litter box becomes smelly.",0
"Our vet recommended cosequin ds after our dog suffered from a luxating patella.  We started cosequin soon after we discovered the issue.  It didn't stop the luxation, however it did seem to help with her recovery after playing aggressively.  Prior to cosequin, she would be on 3 legs for days.  After cosequin it would be a day or less.  She has now had surgery but still goes on 3 legs occasionally.  The cosequin definitely makes a difference.  In fact, Nutramax also makes a cosamin ds product for humans that my wife takes for hip issues.  She says it seems to help a bit.  Do note that the effects aren't immediate.  It took about a month before the we noticed a difference on our dog.",1
"This is the second time I've bought this food for my pet rats, and it's the second time and the only company I've ever bought something that's over 30 pounds and had it arrive three days later. Three days. Estimated shipping time is usually a week and some. My rats love the food, the bags are in always in good condition, the food is never contaminated/moist and the shipping is incredible. This is officially the only company I'll be buying my rats food from.",1
Perfect fit.,1
Didn't really work that well. Disappointed in the product,0
My dog smells amazing and feels so soft!! She smells like she just got back from the groomer!,1
Pretty much did little to nothing to address our Huskie's shedding. It didn't pull of any where near our off-brand furminator style brush. Metal rusted. A waste of money.,0
"Love this product! Used it for months with auto-delivery. It 's so nice not having to go out and pick up a box of litter! It's not a fun thing to carry from store to home, then down the stairs to where I keep it!  Once a month, I go to my door and ""there it is""!",1
My dogs weren't interested in it at all.,0
"No complaints about this product, and not much to add to my title. I had to drive from Northwest Indiana to Kissimmee Florida (a good 17 hour drive, NOT including the periodic rest stops and gas stations) and this was one of 3 pumps I had going for my 3 containers of fish.  As I said, this thing kept trucking along the entire trip, even well after we arrived to our destination.  I'm not sure how much longer it would have lasted, but all I know is, it was STILL going when I decided to just put new batteries in while I kept the fish in their bins while I caught some zzz's.

Great product.  Great reliability.",1
The Extra Small diapers fit my 5 lb Chihuahua perfectly.  They also hold a lot of urine.  I'm very happy with these and will continue to order this brand.  The price is excellent and a few dollars less than the other brands.,1
"I really like SmartyKat Crackle Chute Cat Toy because Ginger loves paper bags and I hoped it would be a good alternative.  It's adorable.  Ginger doesn't use it as often as I had hoped, but she's no longer into bags!",1
"Ok. Not really a chew, more of a treat.",0
"My cats were doing well with this until a few weeks ago. I thought the consistency seemed different, and then my indoor girl started having skin issues. I'm not sure the food caused it, but I can say that it's a different formula AND the price went from $18.96 to $32.00 in 2 weeks!? I've already got something else on the way. The price increase is ridiculous!!",0
"Last October, I rescued a small feeder goldfish from a fraternity who were going to dump it onto the ground. I had poor Stefon in a bowl for almost five days, doing daily water changes to battle the ammonia. Rushed, and with no time to research a tank, I got to the pet store and snapped this up. It seemed like everything I needed, but I didn't know much.
I didn't know anything about goldfish, and so I didn't know this tank is ENTIRELY too small for a goldfish.
Within a week, Stefon got sucked up into the filter. I rescued him, but he only lasted a month more after I medicated for the resulting Septecimia and fin rot.
In January, I bleached the aquarium and put one betta in it. I placed pantyhose over the filter intake and it worked well, although it was too small.
I have since upgraded to a five gallon.
DO NOT BUY THIS DEATH TRAP OF AN AQUARIUM. It will kill most fish you put in it.",0
"Our dogs are rather finicky, but have no trouble with this food. I'm not sure how much healthier it is for them, but being grain free is likely a plus. We have a poodle/bichon frise mix and a shih tzu.",1
"Love the look of them, they fit perfectly into my little aquarium",1
Very cheap looking.,0
"Love these tubes! Perfect for the river, pool, or really any water anywhere! We love using them while we float the river in New Braunfels, TX.  They are a must have!",1
So far I am having trouble getting this to root.,1
"I would have given Feliway 5 stars but I'm not 100% sure it works. I have a nervous cat and this product seems to help calm her down. The few times I have run out of the product there is a difference in my cat's behavior but it is somewhat subtle.

Buying Feliway on line is way less expensive than buying them at my vets.

I am satisfied with this product. I also use the spray for the cat carrier when we are taking a car trip. I know for sure that the spray works. If I don't use it the cat meows for a couple of hours.",1
"great filter until it stops working less than a year later. Warranty is not honored so you're stuck with your dead fish and a piece of junk that cost you ~$200.thanks, fluval - will never buy nother fluval item again.",0
Great purchase.,1
"I want to have a new one replaced by flexi, I bought this one in December  2014 and 5 months later it was broken, I have been using flexi since 2007 and at least each one has a period of life for 3 years and this one I bought was really bad quality,",0
"This is great.  Instead of only lasting a matter of days like other wand toys, this lasted several weeks.",1
I have two large breed dogs 60lbs range and i ordered the small. I was misled by perious coments thinking the small would work well for large dogs and it will but only for 2 piles. I wish i would have ordered the large. The product feels very sturdy and has a nice coating on it that will help resist rust when left outside because lets face it who would keep a poop scoop indoors? Anyways the small would probably be best for households with multiple small dogs or 2 medium breed aprox 30lbs. But for larger dogs id go with the large size.,1
I have a large Mane Coon male cat.  This product did NOT keep the odor in check.  From the first time he used it I could smell the urine odor.,0
"Not for FULL size cats. Once assembled, I was disappointed with the overall size and strength of the product, which is probably better suited to kittens and much smaller cat breeds than mine. I have 2 Exotics, which are similar to Persian. I have tried coaxing them onto the stands using cat treats, but so far after 4 days I have yet to notice either of my boys using this on their own.",0
"I agree with Kristina review on October 2015. At first I got larvae and couldn't figure out where they were coming from...then moths...then saw boxes and filled with larvae and moths. I had to throw away three boxes! I only used 2 boxes out of the bundle that I bought. Initially for months didn't ever have this problem,  but last three orders I did. Will not buy again. So disappointed.",0
Works well.,1
These lasted on my active 45-lb sport dog for less than 30 seconds.  I gave them away.,0
great,1
"My dog absolutely loves this toy, but she chewed out the stuffing the first day. She still plays with it all the time. The fabric is a bit flimsy.",0

Great item fits and looks perfect! Would recommend,1
Poison for dogs! My dog was having a lot of intestinal issues and pain. This was the only treat I was feeding her. As soon as I discontinued she was 100% better. Made in China cap!,0

Durable and bouncy! My german shepherd loves them!,1
My vizsla tolerates this well.,1
Our Goldendoodle loves this bone!,1
"However, my cats (2) not too interested.  The female sits on a chair and watches (of course I bought it for her), and her brother figured it out in about 2 seconds.  Stomps on the mouse until it clicks and then game over.  He just wanders off to find something else to destroy!  His favorite toy this holiday??  A Styrofoam packing cube that came in something else.  Go figure!  Anyway I'll be returning it, I don't know how long it would have lasted had they actually played with it, but it seems to be decently made.  I only gave it 2 stars because it was not a hit with my cats, but it may be with yours.  I think I'll stick with the tried and true, sparkle balls, gift bows and of course the Styrofoam cube!",0

good,1
"Firstly, this is a great product, I have not met a dog who does not adore them, but most of all I love the fact there are no chemicals or preservatives of any type, only ingredient is lamb lung.
Secondly, do not be deceived by the advertising.  You do not get 12 Bags and save $119 (not sure exact amount it says), you get ONE bag, which combined with the $10 odd shipping means its heaps cheaper to buy from your local boutique pet store.",1
It is ok but it doesn't cover from side to side so diet still gets on my seat,0
"We run a rescue specifically for deaf Dalmatians and have had a particularly difficult dog who is very OCD about chasing shadows. The Buster Cube is the only thing that we have found for him that holds his interest. The larger 5"" Buster Cube holds a little bit more than 1 cup of small kibble and keeps him entertained for 30-45 minutes at a time. I highly recommend this puzzle/toy.",1
"This was given to us as a gift and it is conceptually a great product. BUT I have dropped one of them twice and it is now beyond repair and headed for the recycle bin.
The bottle doesn't stand up when you set it on a flat surface because the trough is rounded on the end.  The belt clip is useless, which is why it dropped on the floor the second time for its final break. (the first time was just my own clumsiness) The plastic of the trough is SO weak, it broke after a drop onto a wood floor from waist-height.
I agree - rubberized plastic, or the stuff nalgenes are made of would be the answer to the breaking issue.  From now on, I'll just make sure I have a Porta-Bowl clipped to a Nalgene - it holds a lot more anyway.",0
"these treats are tender, good smelling.  my dog goes crazy for them.  so much that i was able to mix these treats with some other treats that she did not favor so much, and because the bit-o-luv treats are so aromatic, it worked perfectly to get her to eat her not so favorite treats.  they are cut in rectangles, approx 1 x 1.5 inches.  they are the right size to fit into all of our treat holding balls and toys. i started tearing them in half to make them last a little longer, as running out is not an option for my beagle princess!",1
"One of our dogs is an extremely picky eater, whether it's treats, kibble, or canned.  We tried Taste of the Wild, Rachael Ray, and Blue Buffalo dry food.  He only at those if we add some human food.  Even then he would sometimes pick out the human food and leave the kibble to his brother.  Dog canned food didn't work every time.  I received a sample from Purina dog chow complete version and they seemed to have enjoyed it more.  I decided to look into Purina and noticed ""savor"" has shredded meat in tender texture.  Our dogs started showing more interest in it especially ""lamb and rice"" flavor.  I'm still going to rotate the purchases of different meats (chicken/salmon/beef) in case they get bored one day with lamb.",1
good bed well made,1
excellent product sprinkle on the carpet and the flea's are elimanate,1

I took in a feral cat and wanted to start out with a no added fragrance product. The feral cat took to the product with no issues. Cat litter must be one of the heaviest substances know to man / women so shipping it to my front door was a plus.,1
All my cats LOVE their new Kitty Mansion. Our newest kitten has claimed the round hamock as her spot to curl up and sleep.,1
"It works great. Our new kitten likes to sit in front of the tv and attack it. So I decided to try sticky paws. I didn't want to put the tape directly on our tv stand, so I got some rubber mesh shelf liner, put it on the stand under the tv, and the put the tape on the liner. When our kitten went on it for the first time she just seemed curious about it at first. Kind of just stood there and sniffed at it, but then she tried attacking the tv and it stuck to her paws and she didn't like that. She hasn't gone on top of the tv stand since. Just kind of looks at it like she wants to, but then decides against it :-).",1
"Exactly as promised.  I have been using this product for several months and my parrot, who was losing feathers, is now getting them back.",1
Not even worth the money for fun.,0
Love Kong products. Arrived quickly.,1
I was so excited to receive this as well as another dinosaur for the pups. Horrified when I opened the box and found crawly critters inside the plastic bags as well as the shipping box.,0
My little guy really likes these but they don't last longer than a couple minutes.,1
I got this one because the topfin one I had for my small tank was obnoxiously loud. This one was quiet and stable and produced a strong air flow.,1
"My cat loves it! He has never complained, that I know of. He wakes me every morning with a  paw in my mouth to remind me to feed him his favorite food. It keeps him happy and that keeps me happy. Pricing delivered by Amazon is better than I find at the local grocery store.",1
"This is well made, my cats kind of like it. One of my cats will go after it once in a while, at night of course. They watch when I kick it around with my foot, so it's fine but not what I was hoping for! (exercise for the cats, not me . . .).",1

"My 8yr old male had struvite crystals and after clearing that up w/ Royal Canin SO food,(the only thing Rx food he would eat), he was still holding his urine. I tried different litters, attractant, boxes, & bribes to no avail. I tried a homeopathic liquid but no noticeable difference & a couple negative things which might have been from it. I had run out of ideas but saw this product to try & the listing gave very good information. After 2 days,(4 chews),he started going more & I think it's finally going to solve this long & difficult process! He really loves them & haven't had any negative issues. I don't know which of us is more thrilled-Thanks VetriScience!",1
the spray bottle itself doesn't really spray,0
Removes odors safely.  I have one bottle next to my litter box & another for other areas in the house.  Great.,1
"My 10 lb. Papillion mix, can finally sleep tight on our bed.  No more lifting for us any more.",1
Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Cat food is a great product.  My cat is very picky and he loves this food.  It's very good quality.  Good delivery from Amazon and great price.,1
better size for my pets,1
Not chew proof. Dog shredded in seconds. And he barely gets through toys that quick,0
Working well,1
"My cat's wouldn't eat it. They love the Pro plan turkey, however. I took a chance on a different flavor because it was cheap.",0
Extremely unhappy. The item I bought was supposed to be new. When I recieved it there was a card with it describing numerous things broken on it. Have to go through returning it. Situation is not resolved. Extremely disappointed.,0
"Have two cats, the small (7lbs), shorthair who suffers when it is cold loves it. Sticks her head out and tries to coax us into letting her ""eat in bed"". The larger cat (14lbs) with a great heavy coat checked it out and hasn't been in since. Ergo small kitty has two houses.",1
"My conures adore this toy, and so do I. They love the bright colors and the noises it makes when they are playing together. It is exceptionally well made and built to last, both desirable factors when you have little critters that chew through anything.",1
"Even though these balls are expensive, I decided to purchase them so that my dog with poor eye sight may have an easier time with fetch. After a few tosses, my dog compressed the ball in her mouth and it broke! Also, the balls don't bounce like tennis balls and are more solid, which is fine, but if you dog puts any kind of pressure on the ball in its mouth - it's over. Very disappointed. $20 wasted.",0
I received my mdse very fast. But half of the cookies were broken and were not able to feed to my dog.,0
My dog managed to get multiple coils wrapped tightly around his leg the first day. Thinking it was a fluke I used the tie out again and he was badly tangled within minutes. I do not feel that this product is safe for pets. The plastic outer coating on the cable is also peeling after having it in our possession for less than a week.,0
"They're Ice packs , what more can I say. They work and so far durable.",1
"Huge pain to clean, I wouldn't recommend this.",0
"I have six of these and they aren't to hot in cleaning but they are alright for my bettas, being there is only 1 betta in each tank.  I need the suction cups though.  Please can I get some suction cups.",0
"Poor quality product. Housing cracked installing the magnetic base. The ball joint is not strong enough to hold the weight of the fans. Do not buy. Good price point, but pump will not stay in position. Keeps pointing down. Also, only a 4 1/2 ft electric cord that is barely long enough to reach the outlet from our tank.",0
The batteries are TERRIBLE! We have purchased replacement batteries from amazon and they lasted approximately one week! Then we bought batteries from a pet store in our area... they lasted about 2 weeks each! Ridiculous.,0
"I have a Black Lab. This did not remove the loose hair. This brush was useless. Cheaply made. I highly recommend NOT to waste your money on this product. The description of the product is false. If it can not remove hair from a Black Lab how would it begin to remove loose hair from a longer hair dog.
This is being sent back.",0
"It is thin (short) and a little volume (not dense). Nothing like what's described but it's cheap so I guess I expected. I'm glad I just bought the smallest one for the sample. great for a trip. the price is fair for the fast shipping, but don't expect the grass shown in the picture or the description.",0
Pump does not work properly having issues,0

Easy to assemble and a good size for my dog! I don't think it would be a good decision for a larger dog though.",1
"This was purchased as a gift for the holidays. By the time the recipient opened the packaging & found damaged wood (chipboard, not solid), & took pictures of the damaged pieces, Amazon's return window had been exceeded. RIDICULOUS WHEN PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING ITEMS AHEAD OF TIME FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTING!!!!!!!!!!
Disgusted",0
This is exactly what my birds love to eat.  Easy bag to open and close that helps the product stay fresh.,1
It works great don't have any problems,1
not well built.,1
Took my dogs a few days to love it but now it is the only place they will sleep at night,1
"I mix this with either ground round or boiled chicken, and Blue dog food, and they suck it up.",1
My dog went crazy as soon as I opened the mailing envelope! She knew these treats were for her. We both love Down Under Dogs' products. I love that they are made with all natural ingredients. My dog loves the flavor. She's tried several kangaroo varieties and has loved them all. She loved these chicken pops just as much. They are super cute with the rawhide stick. They're great for an extra special treat (or when I feel guilty for leaving her home by herself). I highly recommend these and was excited to try them as part of a promotional offer in exchange for my review.,1
"My Netherland dwarf wriggled out of this and does not like the ""restraining"" aspect of the leash.  I really like the idea of this product as I'd like to be able to let her out of her hutch more often.  For now, she gets access to the fenced garden but catching her to return her to the hutch is sometimes tricky and was hoping the leash would work.  Sadly, not so much.",0
"We have used this system for 7 months and love it.

I have always enjoyed cats but never wanted to own them mostly because of litter box issues. Well the family won out and we adopted a cat and got the Breeze system based on the recommendation of the rescue org we used. So far my fears have not materialized.

I hate going into the homes of cat owners and getting socked in the face with cat waste smell. That was my biggest fear. But we have not yet had this problem because the pee pad does a fabulous amazing job of urine odor control. Plus it is lined in plastic, so the pad doesn't leak or cause a mess, as long as you change it each week. I know some reviewers complain that the pellets don't stop feces odor but I disagree. I find there are two things that make a difference- 1) does the cat cover their feces with the pellets so they can do their job? 2) we usually use 2 bags of pellets, not one. It does make a difference.

I always hated that feeling of getting cat litter grit stuck to your feet and this system has ended that. The little pellets are FAR less messy. When a few get tossed out, they are much easier to clean up than traditional litter, without leaving sandy debris everywhere.

This is a well-designed system. It is inherently cleaner than a traditional litter box. I don't have to scrub out the box itself as often as my mom has to maintain her regular box. My house doesn't smell like cat waste like my friends' and family's. And I don't ever have to walk through gritty sand on my floor.",1
My 8 year old cat always had excessive dander and would often over-groom himself. After three months his coat has never been so beautiful and he no longer excessively grooms.,1
My dogs can't get enough.,1
great,1
"First, there is no way my puppy could get the treats out. With the way the toy is structured, i have to admit that I couldn't get the treats out once i put them in the barnacles - and i had cut the ""spears"" down as the instructions noted that was something one could do to make it easier.
Second, my puppy chewed off a big piece of one of the barnacles within twenty minutes. After that, all he could focus on was ripping more of the pieces off of it.
For context, he's an eight month-old labradoodle. He seems like he's an amazing chewer but he's my first puppy so i can't really compare him to anything else. He destroys most toys and i had hope for this one.",0
"These are really nice treats and they stay soft in the package down to the last one.  Our dogs really like them.  The only thing that is strange to me is the size and thickness varies, and are not standard.",1
This food dish is awesome!  My cat used to stand in his water bowl and spill water all over the floor.  The design of this dish works great so that he can't tip it or splash all over.  VERY pleased with this purchase!,1
"I liked the design of the product -- very clever -- but my dog found its weak point, the zipper, and made a jail break within 2 weeks.",0
My Chin chins love it. keeps their teeth nice and tidy.,1
"UPDATE: after a month this collar stopped being able to be charged. I really rely on this because I do walk in a very poorly lit area at night and my dog plays at the park even after dark. I'm really disappointed in this collar.

INITIAL REVIEW (5 stars): Love this! Kai wore it for the first time last night at the park. It's bright, easy to charge, easy to adjust. Looks great on my big dog. My other dog park friends are looking to purchase the same collars now. Request for colors include: purple and teal!",0
